      "SoftBank's $100 Billion Tech Fund Rankles VCs as Valuations Soar: In the months since Softbank Group Corp. unveiled plans for a $100 billion technology fund, the Japanese company has been making its presence deeply felt across the industry. The Vision Fund closed a few days ago with $93 billion in initial commitments, and already venture firms from London to Silicon Valley are fretting about a behemoth with the resources, clout and name recognition to snatch away the most promising deals. Just last week, SoftBank swooped in and pumped $1.4 billion into Paytm, India’s largest digital-payments startup. The deal boosted Paytm's valuation by about 40 percent to $7 billion. That's not outlandish given Paytm's dominant market position, but the valuations of other SoftBank deals have prompted head-scratching and ignited alarm that a funding atmosphere that only recently cooled off will heat up again. there's the concern that SoftBank will ladle out more money than startups need or can absorb. Already founders approached by SoftBank are caught between the desire to take the money and concern about handing over too much control of their company, according to an investor. One startup targeted by SoftBank has tried to negotiate for less money, this person says. SoftBank won't budge; it's a big check or nothing. SoFi originally asked for less money, too, according to another investor. Pushing startups to take more cash than they ask for has been Son's strategy since the beginning. SoftBank invested more money in Yahoo, Alibaba and Didi than what the entrepreneurs had initially wanted. Pittsburgh Welcomed Uber’s Driverless Car Experiment. Not Anymore. When Uber picked this former Rust Belt town as the inaugural city for its driverless car experiment, Pittsburgh played the consummate host. “You can either put up red tape or roll out the red carpet,” Bill Peduto, the mayor of Pittsburgh, said in September. “If you want to be a 21st-century laboratory for technology, you put out the carpet.” Nine months later, Pittsburgh residents and officials say Uber has not lived up to its end of the bargain. Among Uber’s perceived transgressions: The company began charging for driverless rides that were initially pitched as free. It also withdrew support from Pittsburgh’s application for a $50 million federal grant to revamp transportation. And it has not created the jobs it proposed in a struggling neighborhood that houses its autonomous car testing track. The deteriorating relationship between Pittsburgh and Uber offers a cautionary tale, especially as other cities consider rolling out driverless car trials from Uber, Alphabet’s Waymo and others.LeEco employees are being called to a Tuesday meeting, and massive layoffs are expected: LeEco, a Chinese company that made a big splash in the U.S. last fall, is preparing for a round of layoffs that may happen as soon as Tuesday, according to sources. Two people told CNBC the company is planning massive layoffs in the U.S., with one source saying that only 60 employees will be left after the cut. The company's current headcount in the U.S. is over 500, according to this person. LeEco started out in China as a streaming media provider — it has been referred to as the \"Netflix of China\" — and looked to expand into the US by selling affordable hardware that linked consumers to media content from LeEco's partners. Its first batch of products included two smartphones and several TVs, all of which offered flagship-level specs at affordable prices. The idea, it seemed, was that LeEco would make its money back when consumers tuned in to partner programming. When it made its debut in the US in October 2016, it also promised more, including VR headsets and an electric bicycle.Why Did a Chinese Peroxide Company Pay $1 Billion for a Talking Cat? Even by the opaque standards of Chinese mergers and acquisitions, the deal was a head-scratcher. It’s hard to see the synergies between a maker of chemical solvents and a digital cat perched over a toilet. And curiously, the buyer, which had recently been renamed Zhejiang Jinke Entertainment Culture Co., had revenue of only $133 million in 2016, according to Bloomberg data pulled from regulatory filings, and its gross profit was $55 million. Jinke won’t say where the money to buy Outfit7 came from. Talking Tom is not alone. There’s been a recent flurry of oddball pairings between Chinese industrial interests and Western entertainment companies. A real estate magnate in Beijing bought Legendary Entertainment, the movie studio that made the Dark Knight trilogy, for $3.5 billion. A maker of construction materials bought Framestore, the company behind the special effects in the Harry Potter films. Zhejiang Dragon Pipe Manufacturing Co. acquired app developer Entertainment Game Labs. And perhaps strangest of all, Digital Extremes Ltd., which created an alien battle game, and the studio Splash Damage Ltd., which made an offshoot of the Xbox hit Gears of War, were bought by an enormous Chinese poultry processor. According to CODE Advisors LLC, an investment bank that specializes in media and technology deals, 70 percent of all acquisitions of game companies since 2015 have been by Chinese buyers. Samo, for one, isn’t stopping to ask questions. A vegan, he’s using his windfall to start a food-sustainability foundation. “It’s not easy,” he says, “to find buyers for a $1 billion company.” The deal activity can best be understood as a consequence of quirks in the Chinese stock market. In China, industrial companies trade at valuations they’d never receive elsewhere in the world. Affan Butt, an investment banker who helped facilitate the sale of Jagex, says some may trade at as much as 100 times their annual earnings—more than four times the multiple of General Electric Co. This means they can acquire companies at what is effectively a discount. A target like Jagex is worth more once it’s part of a Chinese-listed company, allowing the acquirer to pay prices that appear bafflingly high to the rest of the world. Softbank-Saudi tech fund becomes world's biggest with $93 billion of capital: The world's largest private equity fund, backed by Japan's Softbank Group and Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, said on Saturday it had raised over $93 billion to invest in technology sectors such as artificial intelligence and robotics. Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son, chairman of Softbank, a telecommunications and tech investment group, revealed plans for the fund last October and since then it has obtained commitments from some of the world's most deep-pocketed investors.  In addition to Softbank and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the new fund's investors include Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment, which has committed $15 billion, Apple Inc, Qualcomm, Taiwan's Foxconn Technology and Japan's Sharp Corp. The new fund made its announcement during the visit of President Donald Trump to Riyadh and the signing of tens of billions of dollars worth of business deals between U.S. and Saudi companies. Son was also in Riyadh on Saturday. After meeting with Trump last December, Son pledged $50 billion of investment in the United States that would create 50,000 jobs, a promise Trump claimed was a direct result of his election win. The fund may also serve the interests of Saudi Arabia by helping Riyadh obtain access to foreign technology. The Saudi economy has been severely damaged by low oil prices, and policymakers are trying to diversify into new industries.Paytm raises $1.4 billion from SoftBank, valuation soars to $7 billion: Paytm has raised $1.4 billion from SoftBank Group Corp. in the largest funding round by a single investor in India, making the digital payments firm the Japanese company’s biggest bet in India’s start-up ecosystem. The deal includes $400 million worth of shares that SoftBank will buy largely from Paytm’s early investor SAIF Partners in a secondary transaction, and a minor stake from founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, according to two persons close to the development. The deal values the company at about $7 billion post-money (including the investment) and will take SoftBank’s stake to about 20%, the two people said, requesting anonymity. Paytm, India’s second-most valuable internet firm, will use the money to acquire 500 million new customers and launch a slew of financial services products such as wealth management, insurance and deposits and loans. “This business will require a lot of capital before it can start generating cash and hence we need long-term investors like SoftBank and Alibaba,” founder Sharma said in a telephone interview.Walmart Reports 63% Rise in Online Sales: On Thursday, the company said e-commerce sales had grown 63 percent in the United States in the latest quarter. The unexpected leap offered the strongest evidence yet that Walmart, the country’s largest retailer, is making headway in its effort to be as prominent online as it is across the American landscape. Walmart’s latest strategy, put in place by its current chief executive, Doug McMillon, has several parts: expand the number of products available online, better leverage its huge physical warehouses and distribution centers to reach customers quickly across the country, and aggressively pursue deals for online stores. The biggest of those deals, in which Walmart paid $3.3 billion for the bulk e-commerce retailer Jet.com last year, was part of the plan to offer customers more products through the web. The earnings results on Thursday gave only hints of about how much the acquisitions gave the company a one-time bump in sales, rather than long-lasting fruit from other changes the company has made. Comparable-store sales, one measure of growth that looks at stores that have been open for at least a year, rose 1.4 percent. That number includes Walmart’s core online business, but not items sold through Jet.com. Walmart completed its purchase of Jet in September. Smaller digital acquisitions followed, including ModCloth, a women’s clothing retailer, and the outdoor apparel site Moosejaw. The deal for Jet was also widely seen as a play for its founder, Marc Lore, a serial digital entrepreneur who could help fix Walmart’s online strategy. Mr. Lore was put in charge of running Walmart.com after the acquisition, spearheading the face-off between the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer and its biggest online competitor.Square Will Replace Meters in Washington Taxis: Washington, D.C., is enlisting Square Inc.’s help as its taxi commission tries to help the city’s cabbies compete with Uber drivers. By the end of August, all of the taxis in Washington have to tear out their traditional meters and start using smartphones or tablets, in what the city government has been describing as a complete reimagining of how the cab system works. For Square, the deal reflects an increasing focus on becoming the payment platform for a range of other company's mobile applications, websites and point-of-sale devices. No money is changing hands between the company and the city. Square agreed to satisfy the department’s requirement that drivers give up no more than 2.65 percent of their fares in transaction fees, according to the department. That’s lower than the standard 2.75 commission it usually takes and significantly less than the 3.5 percent to 5 percent commission that drivers currently pay to use the mechanical meters, according to Ernest Chrappah, the director of the city's taxi regulator.  Chrappah said the lower fees will help make it easier for cabbies to sustain themselves. But the bigger changes come in the increased flexibility that taxi drivers will have once they’re untethered from mechanical meters. There won’t be a single taxi app. Instead, the department is asking developers to build apps, which it will then certify for use by licensed taxi drivers. It is currently working with seven developers, who will make their apps public between now the deadline to replace the meters. It will continue to consider adding new apps as developers pitch them. All of the certified apps must be able to operate as meters for street hails. They’ll also be able to provide digital receipts showing the route they took and give riders the option to rate drivers. Developers can also build services like carpooling or delivery systems that will connect drivers to local merchants looking for people to drop off food, groceries or other products. A developer could build an Uber clone, creating a way to connect drivers to passengers requesting rides through an app. The exact contours of these services will become clear as the individual developers release their software. Taxis will also be able to offer dynamic pricing, where drivers can give discounts during periods when they have trouble securing fares. This resembles Uber’s practice of charging more when demand rises as a way to coax drivers onto the road, only in reverse. Drivers won’t have the option to increase their fares.As self-driving cars hit the road, real estate development may take new direction: The much-hyped transition to autonomous cars, while still years, or even decades, away, according to experts, is an opportunity and challenge that has wide potential to reshape our transportation systems. But many believe that as city planners, transportation officials, and, eventually, developers start grappling with the changes to come, autonomous vehicles’ potential to reshape real estate, development, and city planning will rival that of the introduction of the automobile. At the American Planning Association’s annual conference earlier this month in New York City, the issue of autonomous vehicles and driverless cars, one admittedly far in the future, was the subject of numerous present-day panels, discussions, and debates. [An expert] sees two small but significant changes affecting urban real estate development in the age of driverless cars. A reduced need for parking may be the most significant. High-value property in urban areas needs to account for mandatory parking allowances, forcing developers to factor the cost of parking spaces into construction costs and rent. Local government will need to act decisively to regulate drop-off lanes, speeds, and new parking rules before market forces, and other governments, begin making decisions for them. Technology firms shouldn’t reap the rewards after cities make the investments necessary to adapt to a new transportation reality.Uber Engineer Barred From Work on Key Self-Driving Technology, Judge Says: Uber, the ride-hailing company, sidestepped a full shutdown of its self-driving car efforts on Monday when a federal judge stopped short of issuing a temporary injunction against the program. But the court mandated that Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer leading the program, be prohibited from working on a critical component of autonomous vehicle technology for the duration of the litigation, a setback that could hamper Uber’s development efforts. The decision was in a case that has underlined the increasingly bitter fight between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google’s parent company. The companies have been competing in the development of autonomous vehicles, which many consider the future of transportation. The outcome of the case may affect who wins or loses in the technology, which has also drawn other tech companies, automakers and start-ups. In the ruling on Monday, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco, said, “Waymo L.L.C. has shown compelling evidence that its former star engineer, Anthony Levandowski, downloaded over 14,000 confidential files from Waymo immediately before leaving his employment there.” He added, “Significantly, the evidence indicates that, during the acquisition, Uber likely knew or at least should have known that Levandowski had taken and retained possession of Waymo’s confidential files.” Judge Alsup also ruled that Waymo significantly “overreached” when it asked for protection on more than 120 patents it called trade secrets. “General approaches dictated by well-known principles of physics, however, are not ‘secret,’ since they consist essentially of general engineering principles that are simply part of the intellectual equipment of technical employees,” Judge Alsup wrote. He directed Uber to produce a timeline of the events leading to Mr. Levandowski’s hiring, including all oral and written discussions between the parties about an important self-driving technology called lidar, short for light detection and ranging, which Mr. Levandowski has been accused of stealing. The judge also ordered Uber to do what it could to ensure the return of the files to Waymo, including the possibility of terminating Mr. Levandowski’s employment at Uber.Despite the judge’s ruling on Mr. Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration because its self-driving research program was not shut down, which would have been a more serious blow.Hardly Anyone Paying the Hackers? Because Using Bitcoin Is Hard: An unprecedented cyberattack swept across the globe over the weekend, but so far the majority of victims haven’t paid hackers a ransom. After the ransomware began infecting users on Friday, they were given 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin -- chosen by the hackers because the crypto currency is harder to track than conventional payments -- or pay twice as much. If they refused to pay after seven days, their computer would be permanently locked -- a serious problem for those who haven’t backed up their data. As of early Monday, only about $50,000 had been paid in ransoms, according to Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a London-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands, adding that it expects the total to rise.  Paying a ransom isn’t like buying something from Amazon by entering their credit or debit card information. Even though the hackers provided a helpful link for those new to paying in bitcoin, the crypto currency is a black box for most people. \"If you’re presented with something that says pay this amount in bitcoin, most people don’t know where to start with that,\" said James Smith, the CEO and co-founder of Elliptic. There are several steps. First, a person or business has to obtain the bitcoins by registering with one of the various online exchanges and going through its verification process. After that, money can be deposited into the exchange. For those living in countries that don’t have an exchange, including the U.K., money must be converted into another currency. Once the money is deposited on the exchange, the bitcoins can be sent to the address provided by the extortionist. \"It looks like a long garbled string of text,\" Smith said. After the fee is paid, the hackers supposedly free the affected computer. \"A large amount of bitcoin is actually somewhat difficult to source quickly,\" said Alex Sunnarborg, an analyst at bitcoin research company CoinDesk, adding it might take a few days to create an account at a bitcoin brokerage or exchange, connect a bank account, and then receive the bitcoin. One notable difference with this attack is that the perpetrators demanded a relatively small amount of money but from a large number of people, said James Chappell, chief technology officer and co-founder of U.K. security company Digital Shadows. More typically, he said, hackers demand one large ransom to unlock all the infected machines. \"Quite often they’re in the thousands rather than the hundreds of dollars,\" he said. \"It is unusual to see this piecemeal approach, computer by computer.\"Extortionists Mount Global Hacking Attack Seeking Ransom: Extortionist hackers who may be using leaked computer exploits from the U.S. National Security Agency infiltrated computers in dozens of countries in a fast-spreading attack that forced British hospitals to turn away patients and breached systems at Spain’s Telefonica SA and organizations from Russia to Taiwan. The ransomware used in Friday’s cyber-attacks encrypts files and demands that victims pay $300 in bitcoin for them to be decrypted, the latest in a vexing style of security breaches that, at the very least, forces organizations to revert to backup systems to keep critical systems running. The malicious software has infected more than 75,000 computers in 99 countries worldwide on Friday, most of them concentrated in Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan, according to Dutch cybersecurity company Avast Software BV. While the victim tally is likely to grow, the ransomware, called WanaCrypt0r, only affects computers that haven’t applied Microsoft’s two-month-old fix, a reminder that individuals and organizations that don’t routinely update their machines are vulnerable. Hospitals are notoriously slow in applying security fixes, in part because of how disruptive it is to take patient-facing equipment and databases offline. That has made them a reliable target of ransomware and identity-theft attacks, and why they routinely fall victim even to random mass attacks.Alphabet’s self-driving unit Waymo is teaming up with Lyft: Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google parent company Alphabet, is teaming up with Lyft to work on bringing autonomous vehicle efforts to market, the New York Times reports. Details on what this partnership entails remain a little fuzzy, but sources told Times reporter Mike Isaac the two companies would be working together on pilot projects and product development efforts. That's another way of saying Lyft users in some markets will likely be able to hail a Waymo self-driving car in a limited test sometime down the road. This is not Lyft’s only partnership aimed at bringing self-driving technology into the mainstream. Lyft has a partnership with GM, which last year acquired self-driving startup Cruise. Alphabet was also experimenting with its own ride-hailing app — which the company has been using in its first pilot program in Arizona. But it's not likely the company would solely depend on either that app or the ride-matching service Waze, another Alphabet subsidiary, has been experimenting with to give consumers access to self-driving cars. That’s largely due to the difficulty of gaining market share in the already crowded ride-hail industry — an issue Lyft, the perennial runner up to Uber, knows all too well. The relationship between Uber and Alphabet has gone from tense to combative in the past year. It was long-rumored that the two players would work together on an network of autonomous cars but Uber decided to navigate that road on its own making a competitor of Alphabet as both companies vyed for automaker partnerships. This is just the latest in a series of blows to Uber’s and Waymo’s once potentially fruitful relationship.Netmarble Soars as Korea’s Biggest IPO in Seven Years Takes Wing: Netmarble Games Corp. jumped as investors pursuing a high-growth alternative to traditional industry piled into South Korea’s biggest coming-out party in seven years. Shares in the mobile game developer and publisher climbed as high as 171,500 won in early Seoul trade, 9.2 percent above their initial public offering price, to give the company a market value of more than 14 trillion won ($12.5 billion), surpassing LG Electronics Inc. Founded in 2000 by high-school dropout Bang Jun-hyuk, Netmarble is a rare entrepreneurial success in a nation dominated by politically connected manufacturing conglomerates. Betting smartphones would drive gaming, Bang built the company into one of Asia’s largest publishers of mobile titles such as Lineage 2 Revolution, and won backing from China’s Tencent Holdings Ltd. A successful debut could inspire a generation of talent in a country whose conglomerates have been accused of stifling innovation.  Investors bought in despite the stock trading at valuations well above its rivals: Netmarble was priced at more than 70 times 2016 earnings, surpassing NCSoft Corp.’s roughly 29 times and Nexon Co.’s 45 times as of Thursday’s close. It also faces stiffening competition, with NCSoft releasing a role-playing series this year to directly challenge Lineage 2 Revolution.How Australia Bungled Its $36 Billion High-Speed Internet Rollout: Australia, a wealthy nation with a widely envied quality of life, lags in one essential area of modern life: its internet speed. Eight years after the country began an unprecedented broadband modernization effort that will cost at least 49 billion Australian dollars, or $36 billion, its average internet speed lags that of the United States, most of Western Europe, Japan and South Korea. In the most recent ranking of internet speeds by Akamai, a networking company, Australia came in at an embarrassing No. 51, trailing developing economies like Thailand and Kenya.“Australia was the first country where a totally national plan to cover every house or business was considered,” said Rod Tucker, a University of Melbourne professor and a member of the expert panel that advised on the effort. “The fact it was a government plan didn’t necessarily make it doomed. In Australia, we have changes of governments every three years, which really works against the ability to undertake long-term planning, and the long-term rollouts of networks like this.” Australia poses natural connectivity challenges. It lies oceans away from other countries, and any network would have to connect far-flung cities separated by its sparsely populated interior.Still, Australia had high hopes for its ambitious internet project. Started in 2009, the initiative, known as the National Broadband Network, was intended to bring advanced fiber-optic technology to the doorstep of just about every home and business. It was initially estimated to cost 43 billion Australian dollars, shared by the government and the private sector. But the government share of those costs quickly climbed until taxpayers were responsible for all of it. The technology was slow to roll out, in part because of negotiations with Telstra, Australia’s big telecommunications provider, over installing the fiber. (A Telstra spokesman said the company did not believe the talks added to delays.) The government-funded effort drew fire from the Liberal Party, the opposition at the time, which said the job should have been left to the private sector. After a Liberal-led coalition was elected in 2013, that party looked for ways to contain costs and speed up the rollout. They focused on what in the telecommunications industry is called “the last mile” — the wires that connect a home or business with the broader network. While the National Broadband Network initially envisioned high-speed fiber connecting homes and businesses directly to the network, the Liberal-led effort compromised by connecting them with existing copper wire — basically, the same technology used in the earliest days of the telephone. The result, critics say, was slow speeds that still did not stop rising costs.The Risk in Using a Public Phone Charger: Can a phone really get hacked by plugging it into a public USB charging station? A. If you have ever backed up your phone’s contents by plugging into the computer, you have seen how the USB port can transfer data as well as charge the device’s battery. The concept of “juice-jacking” has been proved at hacker conventions and seen in the wild, and it is definitely possible to transfer malicious software with a phone through a USB connection — perhaps from a computer or device concealed within a public charging station, like those found in airports or malls. If you are traveling and are concerned about keeping your phone’s battery charged, bring your own USB cable and AC adapter so you can plug right into a regular power outlet. The Wirecutter, a product-recommendation site owned by The Times, has suggestions for USB battery packs to bring along when you expect to be away from an outlet for long periods of time. Other solutions for protecting your phone include taking (or making) a power-only USB cable that lacks the internal wiring needed to transfer data. If you do not have one of those cables, power off the device before you plug it into a public charging port (although this is not a foolproof solution for every phone model out there). Last year, the Federal Trade Commission warned consumers against connecting a personal smartphone to the entertainment system through a USB port or Bluetooth wireless link in a rental car. This is because the dashboard software can import and store data from your phone, like your call logs, messages, contacts and locations you requested from the GPS software.As Department Stores Close, Stitch Fix Expands Online: The retail landscape is littered with the casualties of changing consumer behavior. Shoppers are bargain hunting online, department stores are struggling, and once-mainstay brands are closing out permanently. Then there is Stitch Fix, a mail-order clothing service that offers customers little choice in what garments they receive, and shies away from discounts for brand name dresses, pants and accessories. Despite a business model that seems to defy conventional wisdom, Stitch Fix continues to grow. For the fiscal year that ended last July, the company recorded sales of $730 million. It has been profitable since 2014 and has raised just $42 million from outside investors, a relatively modest sum for a high-flying Silicon Valley start-up. Stitch Fix’s pitch is straightforward enough: Trust the company to pick out your tops, bottoms, shoes or accessories for you. When customers sign up, they fill out an extensive form detailing style preferences, clothing needs and price points. The start-up’s algorithms then churn out a set of potential choices, which one of its 3,400 stylists — most of them part time — then tailors to the individual customer before sending out five items in a package. Anything a customer does not want can be returned free of charge, and customers receive a 25 percent discount when they buy everything in the box. Stitch Fix is not the first company to try this business model. Similar start-ups, from clothing rival Trunk Club to the cosmetics specialist Birchbox, have found a market mailing consumers a grab bag of items and offering free returns for anything unwanted. But many such start-ups have had trouble keeping costs down, and customers around. Nordstrom, which bought Trunk Club in 2014 for a reported $350 million, wrote down nearly $200 million from the business’ value last year.VCs Put $110 Million Into Grammar-Checking Software: General Catalyst, a Silicon Valley venture firm, said Monday that it led a $110 million investment in Grammarly Inc. The San Francisco startup makes software that underlines awkward words and phrases in the user’s writing and makes suggestions, similar to a feature in Microsoft Word. Grammarly promises to do more than fix spelling and syntax. It said the software tailors the tone and word choice of personal or professional writing for the 6.9 million people using the tool daily, many of whom interact with the service through a web browser extension for Google Chrome. Grammarly’s funding round is among the largest initial investments for a technology startup recently. The founders of Grammarly had eschewed venture capital since setting up the company in 2009. Grammarly said its business is profitable.Buffett Says His IBM Thesis Was Flawed, He Blew It on Google: Warren Buffett, who long shunned investments in technology stocks and then made an ill-fated bet on IBM, said that mistake shouldn’t discourage wagers on the broader industry. “I thought it would do better in the six years that have elapsed than it has,” Buffett said of International Business Machines Corp. Saturday, at the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “And Apple, I regard them as being in a quite different business. I think Apple is much more of a consumer-products business” with skill at finding opportunities that are difficult for rivals to duplicate. Apple Inc. has become one of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire’s largest holdings, valued at about $19.2 billion as of March 31. The billionaire said this week that he cut about a third of his stake in IBM, sending the shares down 2.5 percent Friday. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger built Berkshire into one of the world’s largest companies with bets on consumer-product companies like Coca-Cola Co. and older industries such as railroads. Munger said Saturday that avoiding Silicon Valley investments made sense for the pair, with some exceptions. “We avoided the tech stocks because we felt we had no advantage there, and other people did. And I think that’s a good idea not to play where the other people are better,” Munger said. “But, you know, if you ask me in retrospect, ‘What was our worst mistakein the tech field?’ I think we were smart enough to figure out Google.” The stock of Alphabet Inc., the parent of Google, has advanced 20 percent this year, and its co-founders became two of the richest people in the world. Buffett said Berkshire’s Geico unit was an early customer of Google, paying the search-engine company when people clicked on the auto insurer’s ads. Given the price that Geico was paying per click, Buffett said, he should have seen the technology company’s promise. “I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,” Buffett said. “But I blew it.” He also said he missed an opportunity by failing to invest in Amazon.com Inc.Infosys, an Indian Outsourcing Company, Says It Will Create 10,000 U.S. Jobs: Facing new corporate demands and political pressure from a Trump administration that wants to curb immigrant work visas, Infosys, one of India’s leading tech outsourcing companies, said Tuesday that it will hire up to 10,000 Americans to serve its clients in the United States. The move makes Infosys the latest Asian technology company to portray itself as a jobs creator as President Trump threatens to take action against companies he sees as hurting American workers. Last month, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing government agencies to review employment immigration laws to promote “Hire American” policies. That included offering suggestions for how to reform the H-1B visa program, which operates as a lottery to bring skilled foreign laborers to the United States each year — usually tech workers. But Infosys is also making its move to hire American driven by other forces. Its home base of India has become a less appealing place to do the grunt work of programming as wages rise there and skilled labor has become more difficult to find. A study of 36,000 engineering students at 500 Indian colleges released last month found that only 5 percent could write software code correctly.Google success in U.S. schools forces Microsoft, Apple to scramble: Microsoft Corp's announcement of a suite of new education products on Tuesday shows the company's determination to reverse a major shift that has taken place in U.S. classrooms in recent years: for most educators and school districts, Google's Chromebook is now the computer of choice. The Chromebook has gone from a standing start in 2011 to wild popularity in the market for education technology, which tech companies have traditionally viewed as a critical way to win over the next generation of users. Huawei, Chinese Technology Giant, Is Focus of Widening U.S. Investigation: As one of the world’s biggest sellers of smartphones and the back-end equipment that makes cellular networks run, Huawei Technologies has become one of the major symbols of China’s global technology ambitions. But as it continues its rise, its business with some countries has fallen under growing scrutiny from investigators in the United States. American officials are widening their investigation into whether Huawei broke American trade controls on Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria, according to an administrative subpoena sent to Huawei and reviewed by The New York Times. The previously unreported subpoena was issued in December by the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which oversees compliance with a number of American sanctions programs. The Treasury’s inquiry follows a subpoena sent to Huawei this summer from the United States Department of Commerce, which carries out sanctions and also oversees exports of technology that can have military as well as civilian uses.Ofo's Zhang Sees China Bike Bubble But Says Startup Will Survive: The co-founder of Ofo Inc., China’s biggest bike-sharing startup, sees a bubble in the industry but says his multibillion dollar business has the scale needed to survive any bust. Ofo plans to expand to 20 countries this year and 200 cities across China, Zhang Siding said Saturday in a Bloomberg Television interview in Zhengzhou, China. He said the company is valued at more than $2 billion.Ofo’s ubiquitous canary-yellow bikes are among more than 25 services now crowding China’s sidewalks. None are seen as profitable thanks to subsidies and low costs, yet together they’ve raised billions of dollars from venture capitalists hoping to cash in on the craze. China’s bike-sharing pioneers are gearing up to compete globally, with arch-rival Mobike previously telling Bloomberg News it wants to enter 100 cities with several foreign locations already in the works. But the flood of bikes has led to angst among China’s local governments and anger from residents. The services typically allow users to park the bikes wherever they like, jamming up the sidewalks. Ofo’s daily revenue is about 10 million yuan ($1.45 million) and it has raised about $650 million since its inception, co-founder Dai Wei said last week in remarks confirmed by the company. Zhang said Ofo is profitable in two cities, but added this wasn’t a major goal for the company. Instead, the priority is to improve the user experience and boost its brand. \"There will be a bubble for the industry,\" he said. \"But as long as we continue to do practical things, then there won’t be a bubble.”Microsoft's Nadella banks on LinkedIn data to challenge Salesforce: Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is rolling out upgrades to its sales software that integrates data from LinkedIn, an initiative that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told Reuters was central to the company's long-term strategy for building specialized business software. The improvements to Dynamics 365, as Microsoft's sales software is called, are a challenge to market leader Salesforce.com (CRM.N) and represent the first major product initiative to spring from Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, the business-focused social network. The new features will comb through a salesperson's email, calendar and LinkedIn relationships to help gauge how warm their relationship is with a potential customer. The system will recommend ways to save an at-risk deal, like calling in a co-worker who is connected to the potential customer on LinkedIn. The enhancements, which will be available this summer, will require Microsoft Dynamics customers to also be LinkedIn customers. The artificial intelligence, or AI, capabilities of the software would be central, Nadella said. \"I want to be able to democratize AI so that any customer using these products is able to, in fact, take their own data and load it into AI for themselves,\" he said. While Microsoft is a behemoth in the market for operating systems and productivity software like Office, it is a small player in sales software. The company ranks fourth - far behind Salesforce.com and other rivals Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and SAP (SAPG.DE) - with just 4.3 percent of the market in 2015, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to research firm Gartner.Nadella is under pressure to show that the pricey LinkedIn acquisition in mid-2016 was worthwhile. R \"Ray\" Wang, founder of analyst firm Constellation Research, said LinkedIn-powered features, combined with popular programs like Office and Skype, could help.Tesla’s big Model 3 bet rides on risky assembly line strategy: Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk took many risks with the technology in his company's cars on the way to surpassing Ford Motor Co's market value. Now Musk is pushing boundaries in the factory that makes them. Most automakers test a new model's production line by building vehicles with relatively cheap, prototype tools designed to be scrapped once they deliver doors that fit, body panels with the right shape and dashboards that don't have gaps or seams. Tesla, however, is skipping that preliminary step and ordering permanent, more expensive equipment as it races to launch its Model 3 sedan by a self-imposed volume production deadline of September, Musk told investors last month. Musk’s decision underscores his high-risk tolerance and willingness to forego long-held industry norms that has helped Tesla upend the traditional auto industry. While Tesla is not the first automaker to try to accelerate production on the factory floor, no other rival is putting this much faith in the production strategy succeeding.Virtual Reality Companies Navigate ‘The Trough of Disillusionment’: Twelve months ago the Virtual Reality World Congress in Bristol, England, was a sell-out show, with over 750 attendees gawping over the latest VR hardware and production techniques. This year's event, which took place last week, attracted even more participants -- more than 1,200 over three days -- but the mood felt decidedly less upbeat. Virtual reality, it seems, has been mugged by reality. Sales of VR hardware have fallen 40 percent behind forecasts, CCS Insight, a technology research group, said in a February report. And the VR hardware that is selling has mostly been relatively inexpensive goggles that allow people to experience VR through their smartphones, such as Samsung's Gear VR and Google's Daydream, not higher-end, dedicated headsets such as those made by Sony Corp, Facebook Inc.'s Oculus and HTC Corp. Many working in VR have run up against the hard economic reality of trying to produce content for a technology that remains, at least for the moment, fairly niche. As disappointment is setting in for virtual reality, expectations are building around its less glamorous cousin, augmented reality, which is also sometimes called mixed reality because it places digitally-rendered elements in the real observed environment. In 2016, Pokemon Go, which is an augmented reality game played on smartphones, became a worldwide phenomenon. Microsoft launched its high-end AR headset, HoloLens, which has found customers mostly among industrial and business users -- such as aeronautical engineers and architects. Snap Inc.'s AR photo filters are one of the most popular features of its messaging service and Facebook has announced a big push into the field with its own AR camera filters.  Many now expect Apple Inc. to introduce an augmented reality product in the next year, which might help AR to leapfrog VR to achieve mass adoption. Technology company ABI Research says that virtual reality currently generates about 50 percent more revenue than augmented reality but that it relies heavily on hardware sales. Augmented reality, by contrast, relies more on software and in many cases can be experienced by users with their existing smartphones. ABI forecasts that AR revenues will surpass VR sales by 2019. Virtual reality true believers, like Taylor, are dismissive of the idea that AR might outrun VR as a blockbuster consumer technology. Augmented reality requires too much training for the average consumer to learn how to integrate the digital images into the real world, Taylor said. \"Mixing the virtual world and the real world is less natural,\" he said. Simply popping on a headset and diving into a completely virtual environment is, somewhat counter-intuitively, easier, he said. ABI Research still forecasts that virtual reality device shipments will reach 110 million units by 2021 -- huge growth considering only about 6.3 million such devices were shipped last year, according to tech research company Super Data. Uber’s C.E.O. Plays With Fire: Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, visited Apple’s headquarters in early 2015 to meet with Timothy D. Cook, who runs the iPhone maker. It was a session that Mr. Kalanick was dreading. For months, Mr. Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ride-hailing app from Apple’s engineers. The reason? So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased — a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apple’s privacy guidelines.  But Apple was onto the deception, and when Mr. Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hot-pink socks, Mr. Cook was prepared. “So, I’ve heard you’ve been breaking some of our rules,” Mr. Cook said in his calm, Southern tone. Stop the trickery, Mr. Cook then demanded, or Uber’s app would be kicked out of Apple’s App Store. For Mr. Kalanick, the moment was fraught with tension. If Uber’s app was yanked from the App Store, it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers — essentially destroying the ride-hailing company’s business. So Mr. Kalanick acceded. In a quest to build Uber into the world’s dominant ride-hailing entity, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms, backing down only when caught or cornered. He has flouted transportation and safety regulations, bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage. In the process, Mr. Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry, with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly $70 billion, and its business continues to grow. But the previously unreported encounter with Mr. Cook showed how Mr. Kalanick was also responsible for risk-taking that pushed Uber beyond the pale, sometimes to the very brink of implosion. Crossing that line was not a one-off for Mr. Kalanick. According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees, investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships, Mr. Kalanick, 40, is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost — a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009.China's LeEco plans sale of $420 million Beijing real estate: Chinese tech conglomerate LeEco is in talks to sell a prized property asset in the heart of Beijing it acquired in a $420 million deal last year, the latest effort by the electric car-to-smartphone behemoth to raise funds amid a severe cash crunch. The company plans to sell either all or a majority of its Shimao Gongsan retail property in a popular area on the east side of Beijing by divesting from two firms it owns, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. LeEco has been in talks with potential investors for some months now, the first person said. LeEco, centered around a Netflix-like video platform operated by its listed unit, has been one of China's boldest tech firms, ambitiously pushing into the U.S. market and looking to take on Elon Musk's Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) in high-end electric vehicles. The firm's wide spread, however, led its billionaire founder and Chief Executive Jia Yueting to admit in November that it was facing \"big company disease\" and battling a cash crunch after expanding too fast. The firm is now reining in its spending, looking to sell property in the United States and scrapping this month a $2 billion deal to acquire U.S. TV maker Vizio. Watch this all-electric ‘flying car’ take its first test flight in Germany: Flying cars, that perennial dream for futurists that always seem to be at least five years away, may be a little closer to reality than we realize. A lot of prototypes have been showcased recently, and a lot of money is being tossed around. More people than ever seem to buy into the crazy notion that in the near future we’ll be buzzing between rooftops in private, autonomous drones. Today, Munich-based Lilium Aviation announced an important milestone: the first test flight of its all-electric, two-seater, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) prototype. In a video provided by the Munich-based startup, the aircraft can be seen taking off vertically like a helicopter, and then accelerating into forward flight using wing-borne lift. The craft is powered by 36 separate jet engines mounted on its 10-meter long wings via 12 movable flaps. At take-off, the flaps are pointed downwards to provide vertical lift. And once airborne, the flaps gradually tilt into a horizontal position, providing forward thrust. During the tests, the jet was piloted remotely, but its operators say their first manned flight is close-at-hand. And Lilium claims that its electric battery “consumes around 90 percent less energy than drone-style aircraft,” enabling the aircraft to achieve a range of 300 kilometers (183 miles) with a maximum cruising speed of 300 kph (183 mph).Bose headphones spy on listeners: lawsuit: Bose Corp spies on its wireless headphone customers by using an app that tracks the music, podcasts and other audio they listen to, and violates their privacy rights by selling the information without permission, a lawsuit charged. The complaint filed on Tuesday by Kyle Zak in federal court in Chicago seeks an injunction to stop Bose's \"wholesale disregard\" for the privacy of customers who download its free Bose Connect app from Apple Inc or Google Play stores to their smartphones. Zak's lawsuit was the latest to accuse companies of trying to boost profit by quietly amassing customer information, and then selling it or using it to solicit more business. After paying $350 for his QuietComfort 35 headphones, Zak said he took Bose's suggestion to \"get the most out of your headphones\" by downloading its app, and providing his name, email address and headphone serial number in the process. But the Illinois resident said he was surprised to learn that Bose sent \"all available media information\" from his smartphone to third parties such as Segment.io, whose website promises to collect customer data and \"send it anywhere.\" Audio choices offer \"an incredible amount of insight\" into customers' personalities, behavior, politics and religious views, citing as an example that a person who listens to Muslim prayers might \"very likely\" be a Muslim, the complaint said. Dore, a partner at Edelson PC, said customers do not see the Bose app's user service and privacy agreements when signing up, and the privacy agreement says nothing about data collection. Edelson specializes in suing technology companies over alleged privacy violations.Silicon Valley’s $400 Juicer May Be Feeling the Squeeze: One of the most lavishly funded gadget startups in Silicon Valley last year was Juicero Inc. It makes a juice machine. The product was an unlikely pick for top technology investors, but they were drawn to the idea of an internet-connected device that transforms single-serving packets of chopped fruits and vegetables into a refreshing and healthy beverage. Doug Evans, the company’s founder, would compare himself with Steve Jobs in his pursuit of juicing perfection. He declared that his juice press wields four tons of force—“enough to lift two Teslas,” he said. Google’s venture capital arm and other backers poured about $120 million into the startup. Juicero sells the machine for $400, plus the cost of individual juice packs delivered weekly. Tech blogs have dubbed it a “Keurig for juice.”But after the product hit the market, some investors were surprised to discover a much cheaper alternative: You can squeeze the Juicero bags with your bare hands. Two backers said the final device was bulkier than what was originally pitched and that they were puzzled to find that customers could achieve similar results without it. Bloomberg performed its own press test, pitting a Juicero machine against a reporter’s grip. The experiment found that squeezing the bag yields nearly the same amount of juice just as quickly—and in some cases, faster—than using the device.PetSmart is acquiring Chewy.com for $3.35 billion in the largest e-commerce acquisition ever: PetSmart has agreed to make the biggest e-commerce acquisition in history, putting a deal in place to snatch up fast-growing pet food and product site Chewy.com for $3.35 billion, according to multiple sources familiar with the deal. The deal is a huge one by any standard — bigger than Walmart’s $3.3 billion deal for Jet.com last year— and especially for a retail company like PetSmart, which was itself valued at only $8.7 billion when private equity investors took it over in 2015. But Chewy.com has been one of the fastest-growing e-commerce sites on the planet, registering nearly $900 million in revenue last year, in what was only its fifth year in operation. The company had been a potential IPO candidate for this year or next, but was taken out by its brick-and-mortar competitor before that. It was not profitable last year. Chewy was founded in 2011 by Ryan Cohen and Michael Day, and built a cult following for its excellent customer service, large selection and fast shipping. It had quietly raised at least $236 million in venture capital from investors including Volition Capital, T. Rowe Price and BlackRock. Its under-the-radar status was probably aided by the fact that it was headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Trump will sign an executive order reviewing high-skilled H-1B immigration visas: U.S. President Donald Trump will order a full review of the country’s high-skilled immigration visa program tomorrow, part of a continued push to clamp down on companies — including, potentially, some in the tech industry — that hire foreigners instead of Americans. In a forthcoming executive order, Trump will commission the Department of Homeland Security, which issues the popular H-1B visa, to review the way they are rewarded. The agency is also instructed to suggest reforms so that visas only land in the hands of highly paid, specially skilled applicants, and not foreign workers who might be paid less than their U.S. counterparts. On its face, Trump’s new directive — a push to “buy American, hire American,” as his aides described it today — does not change the immediate day-to-day working of the H-1B system, which many companies in Silicon Valley support. Instead, at least for the moment, it only opens a formal review of the program. Still, Trump’s move may leave many wary in the tech industry, as it’s the latest in a line of restrictions and changes the administration has introduced to the high-skilled foreign worker visa in recent weeks.Batteries could be Tesla’s secret weapon: Markets are very optimistic about Tesla’s future — so optimistic that it would be impossible to explain if Tesla were a conventional car company. On paper, Tesla shouldn’t be worth anywhere near as much as rivals like Ford and GM. Ford sold 6.6 million cars in 2016. GM sold 10 million. Tesla sold a paltry 76,000. Ford and GM both turned healthy profits in 2016. Tesla lost money. Yet earlier this month Tesla’s market value surged past Ford and then briefly eclipsed GM as America’s most valuable carmaker. One big reason for this is that Tesla has made a risky bet on batteries that could be on the verge of a huge payoff. Because Tesla cars are purely electric, a single car needs about 1,000 times as much battery capacity as a typical smartphone. So making electric cars a mainstream technology will require producing batteries on a scale that dwarfs today’s production for smartphones and other portable gadgets. A major test of this will come in Tesla’s release of the Model 3 later this year. These cars will be powered by batteries from the Gigafactory, a huge factory Tesla has constructed in the Nevada desert. If the Model 3 is a hit, experts say, the Gigafactory will ensure Tesla has plenty of batteries to meet demand for this relatively affordable mass-market vehicle. Other car companies would have to scramble — not only to design a similar stylish vehicle, but also to find suppliers for yet more batteries. Experts say this battery advantage won’t last forever — other battery makers might be able to catch up within a year or two. But having a year or two head start could make a big difference — not only cementing Tesla’s reputation as the leading electric car brand, but positioning Tesla to make further investments that could help it stay a step ahead of rivals down the road.How Infosys’s $20 billion revenue target by 2020-21 is hurting the firm: Infosys Ltd, despite a relatively good performance over the past two years, is battling perceptions of under-performance because of its inability to keep pace with its ambitious target of more than doubling its revenue to $20 billion by March 2021. This target appears to have done more harm than good: analysts continue to rate the company using it as a metric; and people in the know attribute the departure of at least a few senior executives over the past few years to it. Now, an analyst at a foreign brokerage has suggested that the company is better off without the target. “Management continues to maintain ‘aspirational’ revenue and margin targets that are increasingly becoming unlikely to be achieved, in our opinion. Given Infy (Infosys) is now guiding to lower levels of both revenue growth and margins in FY18 (2017-18), we think management would be well-served to either amend or drop its aspirational targets,” Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 16 April. Since outlining this target, Sikka steered Infosys to dollar revenue growth of 9.1% in 2015-16 and 7.4% in 2016-17; for the second consecutive year, Infosys will grow faster than its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and cross-town peer Wipro Ltd (Wipro). Still, Infosys continues to be evaluated on the progress it makes in becoming a $20 billion company. Worryingly for the management, a bigger fallout of the targets has been the pressure on senior leaders, making a few of them leave. Since April 2015, half-a-dozen executive vice-presidents (EVPs) and a dozen senior vice-presidents (SVPs) have quit. Not all departures are on account of the targets but two former executives admit that they left Infosys as they could not keep up with the “impossible targets.”Apple is finally going to test self-driving cars: After months of speculation that the company is developing automotive technology, Apple has officially leapt into the war for self-driving cars by obtaining a test permit from California regulators. The permit allows Apple to begin testing up to three 2015 Lexus SUVs similar to the type that Google uses for its autonomous cars. By obtaining clearance from California's Department of Motor Vehicles, Apple is signaling that it is serious about pushing forward with self-driving technology despite reports last fall that it was scaling back its ambitions. California's DMV disclosed the permit on its website Friday, which lists several dozen other companies that are testing self-driving technology. The group includes BMW, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Uber and others. Like those other companies, Apple's test vehicles will have human drivers behind the wheel when they go out on public roads, according to California regulations.Uber Wants to Rule the World. First It Must Conquer India.  After last year’s bruising retreat from China, where the company was outgunned by local incumbent Didi Chuxing, Uber is diving fully into this nation of 1.3 billion people, pouring money, engineers and logistical expertise into dominating what could one day be the world’s largest market for transportation services. Back at Uber’s headquarters in San Francisco in January, Mr. Kalanick, sitting at the head of a small conference table, offered a proud assessment of his company’s role in India. Sipping an iced tea, he said he planned to spend 20 days year in the country, more than in any other market outside of the United States. (He made headlines on a recent trip for offering to become an Indian citizen if it would help Uber’s prospects there.) When I asked if India was Uber’s second-biggest market, he rolled his eyes to the ceiling, as if accessing a spreadsheet stored behind his eyelids. “Hold, let me check, let me think,” he said, and then made a “boop boop boop” sound as the numbers came to him. “We’ll say India’s No. 2,” he declared. At other times during the 40-minute conversation, Mr. Kalanick seemed to grow agitated at questions about some of the difficulties of working in the Indian market. Indian cities do not present any problems that Uber couldn’t overcome, he said, or that it hadn’t seen anywhere else in the world. What about the traffic, the low ownership of cars, the local competitor? “I’m losing your angle,” Mr. Kalanick responded. “I feel like I’m getting asked the same question over and over again. I don’t get it.” Then he excused himself to get a second iced tea. A few minutes later, he returned and I asked again if he was sure Uber would be profitable in India. “Yeah,” he said. He didn’t elaborate, so I prodded him on how he might know that to be true. “I mean, I know all the data,” he said.Yext finishes the day up 21% as IPO window remains wide open: Yext, the company which helps businesses power their location data, went public on the New York Stock Exchange today. After pricing shares above the expected range at $11, the price rose 21% to $13.29 by the end of the first day of trading. With a client list that includes Best Buy, McDonald’s and Marriott, Yext is responsible for the location results that appear on search engines, maps and social media. The company recognized early on that consumers would prefer to find nearby locations without visiting brand websites. In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO Howard Lerman emphasized that Yext plans to evolve beyond location data. They want Yext to be a “knowledge engine,” where they will make it easier to help customers find the best doctor, their ideal automobile, or an event to attend. The IPO raised $115.5 million for the company, and Lerman says they plan to use the capital to further invest in sales and marketing. A large part of their business is convincing large enterprises that Yext provides enough value add to pay for their services. Yext brought in $88.6 million in revenue in the nine months ending in October of last year, with losses of $28.6 million for the same time frame. Revenue is up from the $64 million they saw in the same period the year before and losses narrowed to $18.2 million. Yext previously raised more than $117 million in venture funding at more than a $500 million valuation. The stock market is valuing the company above $1 billion, a favorable sign at a time when there are “down round IPOs.”Nintendo Shares Jump After Switch Sets U.S. Sales Records: Nintendo Co. shares jumped as much as 4 percent after the company said its new Switch console is off to a record-setting pace in the U.S. since its March 3 debut. The new device sold 906,000 units in North America during March, according to industry researcher NPD Group. That means the gaming machine “sold faster in its launch month than any other video game system in Nintendo history,” according to Nintendo. The Switch has received praise for its console-tablet hybrid design that lets gamers play both in the living room and outside the house. While its limited software lineup and limited graphics ability have been criticized, demand has consistently outstripped supply during the first six weeks of sales. That’s buoyed investors who think the Switch is on track to become a bigger hit than the Wii, the company’s best-selling home console of all-time.Burger King debuts Whopper ad that triggers Google Home devices: Fast-food chain Burger King said on Wednesday it will start televising a commercial for its signature Whopper sandwich that is designed to activate Google voice-controlled devices, raising questions about whether marketing tactics have become too invasive. The 15-second ad starts with a Burger King employee holding up the sandwich saying, \"You're watching a 15-second Burger King ad, which is unfortunately not enough time to explain all the fresh ingredients in the Whopper sandwich. But I've got an idea. OK, Google, what is the Whopper burger?\" If a viewer has the Google Home assistant or an Android phone with voice search enabled within listening range of the TV, that last phrase - \"Hello Google, what is the Whopper burger?\" - is intended to trigger the device to search for Whopper on Google and read out the finding from Wikipedia.BlackBerry Jumps as $814.9 Million Qualcomm Refund Bolsters Cash: BlackBerry Ltd. stock rose the most in more than two years after it was awarded $814.9 million to end a dispute with Qualcomm Inc. over royalty payments, giving it cash needed to help recast itself as a software maker. The two companies had agreed to enter binding arbitration to settle claims by BlackBerry that it was owed refunds on technology licensing fees prepaid to the chipmaker. The announcement sent BlackBerry shares up as much as 19 percent in New York, the most intraday since January 2015. The refund from Qualcomm will boost BlackBerry’s cash hoard, which stood at $1.7 billion at the end of its fiscal fourth quarter, helping Chief Executive Officer John Chen as he spends more money to shift the company’s focus to software and security-focused products. BlackBerry no longer makes the phones that used Qualcomm technology and arguedthat it was due a refund after sales collapsed.Google’s AutoDraw uses machine learning to help you draw like a pro: Drawing isn’t for everyone. I, for one, am definitely not very good at it. But with AutoDraw, Google is launching a new experiment today that uses machine learning algorithms to match your doodles with professional drawings to make you look like you know what you’re doing. You can use AutoDraw on your phone or desktop and the experience is pretty straightforward. You simply start drawing your best version of a pizza, or house, or dog, or birthday cake and the algorithms try to figure out what it is that you’re trying to draw. It then tries to match your squiggles with drawings in its database, and if it finds any possible matches, it’ll show them in a list at the top of your virtual canvas. If you like one of those options, you simply click on it and AutoDraw replaces your amateurish creation with something a bit slicker.Amazon Said to Mull Whole Foods Bid Before Jana Stepped In: Amazon.com Inc., seen as a possible bidder for Whole Foods Market Inc., pondered a takeover of the organic-food chain last fall but didn’t pursue a deal, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. The e-commerce giant considered internally whether Whole Foods would help invigorate its nearly decadelong push into groceries, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations were private. The discussions never turned into a concrete plan, according to the person. Though Whole Foods has long been seen as a buyout target, activist investor Jana Partners LLC set off a new wave of speculation this week when it acquired a stake and urged the company to evaluate a sale. With a market valuation of $10.7 billion, the ailing organic-food retailer would be an outsized acquisition for Amazon -- dwarfing its 2009 purchase of online shoe retailer Zappos for about $1.2 billion. But the deal would turn Amazon into a grocery giant overnight and help it sideline Instacart Inc., a startup that delivers grocery orders from Whole Foods stores in more than 20 states and Washington, D.C. Shares of Whole Foods jumped as much as 5.8 percent to $35.50 in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the Amazon discussions. The stock was already up 9.1 percent this year through Tuesday’s close, with most of the rally coming after Jana announced its stake Monday.Qualcomm sues Apple for hobbling its iPhone chips to make Intel look better: After Apple hit Qualcomm with a barrage of lawsuits earlier this year, the chipmaker is countersuing Apple right back. Qualcomm today filed its Answers and Counterclaims to Apple’s January lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of California. The full details of the suit can be read in a 139-page document (PDF) released by Qualcomm, but the company has five key complaints — including the claim that Apple deliberately didn’t use the full potential of Qualcomm chips in iPhone 7 phones so that they wouldn’t perform better than the modems provided by Intel. Qualcomm says that Apple “chose not to utilize certain high-performance features of the Qualcomm chipsets for the iPhone 7 (preventing consumers from enjoying the full extent of Qualcomm’s innovation),” and when Qualcomm iPhones supposedly outperformed Intel iPhones, “Apple falsely claimed that there was ‘no discernible difference’ between” the two variants.The company also says that Apple prevented it from revealing to customers “the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm’s chipsets outperformed iPhones with Intel’s chipsets.” As part of its five core arguments, Qualcomm says Apple “threatened” it to keep quiet about the differences between Intel and Qualcomm iPhones, preventing Qualcomm from “making any public comparisons about the superior performance of the Qualcomm-powered iPhones.” Other complaints in the countersuit include claims that Apple breached and mischaracterized agreements and negotiations with Qualcomm, encouraged attacks on the company in a number of markets by misrepresenting facts and making false statements, and interfered with Qualcomm’s existing agreements with other companies. Apple’s original suit against Qualcomm was filed in January this year in the United States, and claimed $1 billion from the chipmaker, arguing that it had been drastically overcharging for the use of patents. That was followed up by two additional suits — one in China and one in the United Kingdom — that also focused on patents and designs. A case filed in Beijing claimed 1 billion yuan ($145 million) for Qualcomm’s abuse of China’s monopoly laws. Tim Cook said that Apple had “no choice” but to sue Qualcomm, even after the two companies had worked together for many years, saying that he and his company “didn’t see another way forward.” According to Cook, Qualcomm was “insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with,” collecting money on features like Apple’s TouchID fingerprint readers and cameras.Battle of Billionaires: Son Set to Clash With Bezos in India: SoftBank Group Corp.’s Masayoshi Son and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos are heading for a clash in India. SoftBank is closing in on an agreement to combine its e-commerce company Snapdeal with market leader Flipkart Online Services Pvt., creating a stronger domestic player to compete with the American behemoth, according to people familiar with the matter. To get the merger done, Son is willing to cut Snapdeal’s valuation 85 percent to $1 billion, said the people, asking not to be named because the talk is private. The combination of India’s two leading e-commerce players is being called an arranged marriage, said the people, with Son playing the role of matchmaker. The Japanese billionaire, who owns about a third of Snapdeal parent Jasper Infotech Pvt, plans to contribute that equity to the merged entity and to infuse another $500 million to $1 billion in Flipkart through a transaction with Flipkart backer Tiger Global Management, the people said. Flipkart is already raising cash for the battle. The Bangalore-based company said Monday it had raised $1.4 billion from Tencent Holdings Ltd., Microsoft Corp. and EBay Inc. in what it said was the largest internet investment in India. That would give Flipkart more firepower to battle Amazon in one of the world’s fastest growing online retail markets. The Seattle-based company has vowed to spend $5 billion in the country and India chief Amit Agarwal has used the money to gain customers. Flipkart said the post-transaction valuation for the company was $11.6 billion. An alliance among Flipkart, Snapdeal and EBay could give the business customers, scale and technology, though it’s not clear how easily those could be integrated.Why eBay’s CEO sold eBay India and poured $500 million into the country’s top Amazon rival: Can you explain how you went from investing in Snapdeal — and then selling most of your stake in them — to investing in one of its biggest competitors, Flipkart? Devin Wenig: The process started almost a year ago with us looking at the Indian market and seeing who was winning and who was losing and what the next few years were going to be like. We were evaluating both eBay India and Snapdeal. And what was the conclusion? I’ll start by saying I really do believe the market will be a strong commerce market. There are just too many positive dynamics: Too much growing wealth, too much tech adoption, too much demand for goods and supply-demand imbalance. It’s also true that the market has been overheated, not rational, and probably over-invested in too many companies. It’s been a very unhealthy e-commerce dynamic for a few years. The conclusion was, it was going to have to consolidate, that fewer parties were probably a good thing for the market. Flipkart had a very strong close to last year and they are starting to pull away. So if we are serious about the market, I want to invest in — and be partners with — those that are going to win. The conclusion was there weren’t going to be 10 winners, but maybe only one or two. And Flipkart — given all of that — was the natural party to align with. How concerned are you about how unprofitable all the companies in this market are? Consolidation in the market is healthy and we believe Flipkart will do what it takes to build a long-term business. But long term might be long term. It might take more money and more time. Am I concerned about it? Yeah, of course. But we think that these moves in the market make it much more likely that in a reasonable time frame and investment, they will get to a profitable scale.U.S. drone sales have more than doubled from last year: U.S. drone sales have more than doubled between February 2016 and February 2017, according to new data released today from NPD group. Customers may shy away from a high price tag. In the first two months of 2017, drones that cost over $300 accounted for less than half — 40 percent — of units sold. Still, drones costing over $300 amount to 84 percent of dollar sales in the past two months, NPD found. It’s not for unusual for high-end products to make up the bulk of dollar sales in an industry, even if cheaper products account for the majority of sales. Still, it means that most people are trying to find a cheaper drone — something China’s DJI, the biggest consumer drone maker in the world, has yet to produce. The cheapest drone DJI has on its website right now is around $500 for a new Phantom 3. Its next cheapest drone is the Mavic Pro at $1,000. When buying smaller unmanned aircraft, consumers jumped for high tech bells and whistles. In January and February 2017, drones costing between $300 and $500 sold five times faster if they came equipped with autopilot features and 19 times faster if the drones could detect and follow the person operating it, such as when riding a bike or running.Battle of Billionaires: Son Set to Clash With Bezos in India: SoftBank Group Corp.’s Masayoshi Son and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos are heading for a clash in India. SoftBank is closing in on an agreement to combine its e-commerce company Snapdeal with market leader Flipkart Online Services Pvt., creating a stronger domestic player to compete with the American behemoth, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing, the report says, is encouraging its companies to invest for the purpose of pushing the country ahead in its strategic competition with the United States. In some instances, Chinese companies have made under-the-radar investments intended to dodge the oversight of a government agency, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as Cfius. “If we allow China access to these same technologies concurrently, then not only may we lose our technological superiority, but we may even be facilitating China’s technological superiority,” the report says.Snapdeal founders move to calm employees amid takeover speculation: The founders of India's Snapdeal told employees in an email on Sunday that the e-commerce company will ensure there is no disruption to staff \"as the way forward becomes clear,\" as speculation of a takeover swirls. The email, seen by Reuters, tacitly acknowledged that a sale of the company could be in the offing, and it sought to calm the concerns of employees at India's No. 3 e-commerce player. Snapdeal has for weeks been at the center of much takeover speculation, with its largest backer Japan's Softbank, seen as keen to sell the company to its larger rival, Tiger Global-backed Flipkart.TaskRabbit Is Exploring a Sale: TaskRabbit Inc., an online marketplace for errands and one-off jobs, is looking into selling itself after receiving interest from a potential buyer. The San Francisco startup declined to name the suitor. A spokeswoman said TaskRabbit is \"exploring options opportunistically.\" The move was reported earlier Friday by technology website Recode. TaskRabbit was founded in 2008 by Leah Busque, who wanted to be able to pay someone to buy dog food for her pet. From there, the company became known as a pioneer of the \"gig economy,\" though it has struggled to find its place among heavily capitalized competitors. Last year, when TaskRabbit raised more funds, it significantly lowered its valuation in order to appeal to investors. Busque stepped down as chief executive officer and was replaced by Stacy Brown-Philpot, a former Google executive. Brown-Philpot had promised to make the company profitable by the end of 2016 but later backed away from the projection.Lyft Gets $500 Million in New Funding as Its Rival Uber Wobbles: For years, Lyft has trailed its larger rival Uber in the battle to conquer the ride-hailing market. More recently, Lyft has gotten a boost. The smaller ride-hailing company has secured up to $500 million in a new round of funding that values Lyft at $6.9 billion before the addition of new capital, according to two people briefed on the discussions, who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential. The privately held company may raise an additional $100 million, these people said. The financing gave Lyft a $2.4 billion increase in value since the company last raised money in 2016. It was not immediately clear which investors were participating in the new financing. Lyft’s previous investors included the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba. Lyft is being bolstered by the woes at Uber, which has been dealing with scandals involving the company’s workplace culture and aggressive leadership team. A grass-roots movement to boycott Uber has sprung up around the country, with the hashtag #deleteuber spreading quickly across Twitter related to the company’s shortcomings.Why Spotify’s IPO-less IPO is a smart idea:Here's a smart idea: In a traditional IPO, the company listing the stock sells shares to a bunch of institutional investors, like hedge funds and pension funds, at an “initial offering price.” The next day, those institutional investors sell those shares on an open exchange like the New York Stock Exchange. This is when regular folks can buy shares, but at a higher price than the IPO. That’s what generates the “pop,” you always read about on IPO day. The pop also comes since the institutional investors should get a return for the risk they took in the IPO. Let’s take a recent, real-world example: Snap sold stock in its IPO last month for $17 a share. That means Snap’s early investors, like Benchmark, got $17 for every share they sold. But the next day, when those IPO investors sold shares on the NYSE, the stock traded at $24, a 41 percent pop above the IPO price. Every penny above $17 is a penny Snap and its early investors didn’t get. So you could argue the pop was bad for the early owners of Snap. They left 41 percent on the table. So you could see how Spotify CEO Daniel Ek might not want to go through the IPO process. Why give all that money to brokers, instead of people who own Spotify, like his investors, his employees and Ek himself?  Instead, by listing directly, Spotify can skip the IPO pricing altogether and just sell shares on an open exchange. The conceit of a direct listing is that it’s more democratic, very logical, very internet. You can see the appeal to Ek. But there is a rationale for the IPO process too. By hiring underwriters, a company is “pre-selling” shares to qualified buyers. That assures the company will get something for its shares while also stoking interest in the open market. You might even argue that in the case of Snap’s IPO it might not have even gotten $17 a share if they hadn't hired bankers to manage the sale. In effect, the bankers set a price range, then go to the big institutional investors to see where they’ll bite before narrowing in on a set price. (Some analysts have pegged $15 as a fair value price for Snap shares.) Underwriters like Goldman Sachs are paid as much as 7 to 8 percent commission for their work, but companies can negotiate that down. In the case of Snap, it was about 2.5 to 3 percent, according to sources.Facebook's Whatsapp Is Getting Into Digital Payments in India: Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp is getting into digital payments in India, a first for a global messaging service that’s only just begun to explore ways to generate revenue. It’s chosen to kick off that maiden effort in India, a market dominated by Alibaba-backed digital payments leader Paytm but where WhatsApp’s 200 million users outnumber any other country. WhatsApp wants to “contribute more to India’s vision for digital commerce,” it said in a statement Wednesday. The company also advertised on its website for a “Digital Transactions Lead, India” to be based in Menlo Park, California, but with an ability to understand local financial standards such as India’s digital-ID program Aadhaar and its banking payments interface. India is seeing unprecedented activity in digital payments, particularly since the government banned high-value currency notes in November and took a series of steps to incentivize digital payments in a country where cash remains king. Among the market’s recent entrants is Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins-backed Truecaller.Jeff Bezos Says He Is Selling $1 Billion a Year in Amazon Stock to Finance Race to Space: Standing against the backdrop of his New Shepard rocket booster and a full-scale mock capsule for carrying humans into space, Jeff Bezos revealed on Wednesday that he was selling about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company. Mr. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, showed off the reusable rocket booster and the mock-up of the capsule that will take people up for panoramic views back down at earth, during a symposium here. Mr. Bezos, who hopes to build Blue Origin into a commercial and tourist venture, also disclosed that it would cost about $2.5 billion to develop an even bigger rocket, New Glenn, capable of lifting satellites and, eventually, people into orbit. Like his fellow technology titan Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, Mr. Bezos has identified reusable rocket parts as a key to lowering the price of admission to the field, which he said on Wednesday would lead to a “golden age of space exploration.” Last month, Mr. Bezos announced the first-paying customer, Eutelstat, a satellite company, for New Glenn, whose commercial flights would help offset costs. New Glenn is expected to fly by 2020, he said, but humans will not be passengers on the heavy-lift rocket until many years after that. Mr. Bezos has repeatedly expressed caution about setting timetables for the start of Blue Origin’s commercial or passenger trips, and he did not diverge from that on Wednesday. He would not say when New Shepard would undergo its next round of test flights, or set a specific date as a goal, merely mentioning next year for possible tourist trips.Australian regulator sues Apple alleging iPhone 'bricking': Australia's consumer watchdog has sued Apple Inc (AAPL.O) alleging it used a software update to disable iPhones which had cracked screens fixed by third parties. The U.S. technology giant \"bricked\" - or disabled with a software update - hundreds of smartphones and tablet devices, and then refused to unlock them on the grounds that customers had had the devices serviced by non-Apple repairers, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said in a court filing. \"Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer's warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party,\" ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. The regulator said that between September 2014 and February 2016, Apple customers who downloaded software updates then connected their devices to their computers received a message saying the device \"could not be restored and the device had stopped functioning\". Customers then asked Apple to fix their devices, only to be told by the company that \"no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, provide a remedy\" for free, the documents added.SoftBank moots Snapdeal sale to Flipkart, proposed deal set to be biggest in Indian e-commerce: SoftBank, the largest shareholder in Snapdeal, held boardroom discussions on the proposed sale of the online marketplace to rival Flipkart on Tuesday, according to two people aware of the development. According to the terms proposed by the Japanese media and telecom conglomerate, Snapdeal shareholders will get one share of Flipkart for every ten they own, said the people cited above. Early investors in Snapdeal — Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners — have also asked for about $100 million each from the sale, the sources said. The proposed sale could see SoftBank pick up a 20% stake in the country's largest ecommerce company for about $1.5 billion, in the process buying out $500 million to $1 billion worth of Tiger Global's holding in Flipkart, according to two people aware of the matter.  Alibaba-backed Paytm E-commerce has also discussed a potential acquisition of Snapdeal, but the valuation offered was much lower than that offered by Flipkart, added another source.  The meeting signals easing of tensions between Kalaari and Nexus, and SoftBank, said one of the sources mentioned above. Troubled Chinese Giant LeEco Said to Delay Paying U.S. Employees: Chinese technology conglomerate LeEco Inc. delayed payroll for U.S. employees this month, people familiar with the matter said, another sign that billionaire Jia Yueting’s media and Internet empire is grappling with a cash squeeze. LeEco’s U.S. employees are normally paid on the 15th and last day of every month, but the company has told employees that March 31 paychecks would be delayed until April 4, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. LeEco told employees in the U.S. the delay was due to issues with moving money from China, according to one of the people. After rapid expansion of his tech empire, Jia admitted late last year that the company was struggling to raise cash. Some suppliers said that LeEco was behind on payments and the company was stripped of some sports broadcasting rights after defaulting. The paycheck delays are stoking frustration at a U.S. operation that’s suffered key executive departures in the last few months. Jia said in October that LeEco employs more than 500 people in the country “with more being added each week,” but the company hasn’t disclosed its latest U.S. headcount.Apple aims for more control, less cost as it accelerates in chip design: Apple's decision to stop licensing graphics chips from Imagination Technologies Group Plc is the clearest example yet of the iPhone maker's determination to take greater control of the core technologies in its products - both to guard its hefty margins and to position it for future innovations, especially in so-called augmented reality. The strategy, analysts say, has already reduced Apple's dependence on critical outside suppliers like ARM Holdings Plc, now owned by SoftBank Group Corp. Apple once relied heavily on ARM to design the main processor for the iPhone, but it now licenses only the basic ARM architecture and designs most of the chip itself. More recently, when Apple bought the headphone company Beats Electronics, part of a $3 billion deal in 2014, it ripped out the existing, off-the-shelf communications chips and replaced them with its own custom-designed W1 Bluetooth chip. \"Apple clearly got rid of all the conventional suppliers and replaced about five chips with one,\" said Jim Morrison, vice president of TechInsights, a firm that examines the chips inside electronics devices. Most vendors of consumer electronics products rely on outside suppliers for chip design and development, primarily because it is extremely expensive. That has created huge opportunities for companies like ARM, Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp, which have developed core technologies for processing, communications and graphics that are used by scores of vendors. Now, though, Apple is so big that it can economically create its own designs, or license small pieces of others' work and build on it. As with ARM and Qualcomm, the actual manufacturing of the chips is still contracted out to a semiconductor foundry, such as those run by Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd.Tesla Passes Ford in Market Value as Investors Bet on the Future: The record pace of auto sales in the United States is slowing down, leaving investors increasingly bearish on auto stocks. But there is one exception. Tesla, the electric-vehicle upstart, continues to surge. On Monday, Tesla surpassed Ford Motor in market value for the first time and moved within striking distance of General Motors, starkly illustrating the growing gap in investors’ optimism over its future versus the prospects for the traditional carmakers from Detroit. While G.M. and Ford may have strong profits and healthy balance sheets, Tesla offers something Wall Street loves much more: the potential for dramatic growth. “Investors want something that is going to go up in orders of magnitude in six months to six years, and Tesla is that story,” said Karl Brauer, a senior editor at Kelley Blue Book. “Nobody thinks Ford or G.M. is going to do that.”At the end of Monday’s trading, Tesla reached a market capitalization of $48.7 billion compared with Ford’s $45.6 billion, according to Bloomberg. General Motors was at $51.2 billion. Tesla’s market milestone came at the intersection of two countervailing trends. On Sunday, Tesla said its first-quarter sales were up 69 percent from the same period a year ago. On Monday, monthly sales figures for the conventional automakers showed them struggling to meet last March’s performance.Trump Cracks Down on H-1B Visa Program That Feeds Silicon Valley: The U.S. administration began to deliver on President Donald Trump’s campaign promise to crack down on a work visa program that channels thousands of skilled overseas workers to companies across the technology industry. Fed up with a program it says favors foreign workers at the expense of Americans, the Trump administration rolled out a trio of policy shifts. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency on Friday made it harder for companies to bring overseas tech workers to the U.S. using the H-1B work visa. On Monday, the agency issued a memo laying out new measures to combat what it called \"fraud and abuse\" in the program. The Justice Department also warned employers applying for the visas not to discriminate against U.S. workers. The new guidelines released Friday require additional information for computer programmers applying for H-1B visas to prove the jobs are complicated and require more advanced knowledge and experience. It’s effective immediately, so it will change how companies apply for the visas in an annual lottery process that begins Monday. The changes don’t explicitly prohibit applications for a specific type of job. Instead, they bring more scrutiny to those for computer programmers doing the simplest jobs.Cloudera’s IPO will test unicorn valuations: Cloudera filed to go public mid-day last Friday, releasing a set of financial numbers that were the locus of anticipation: How would the company’s recent performance stack up to its $4.1 billion valuation set three years ago? Before Cloudera published its S-1 document — detailing its recent quarterly results and several years of financial data — reports indicated that the company would pursue a $4.1 billion valuation in its IPO, flat from its last private round when Intel poured $740 million into the company. That Cloudera might aim for a level valuation with a dozen or so quarters of additional growth under its belt was notable. (Crunchbase News reached out to Cloudera regarding the valuation figure. The company declined to comment.) The situation raises an obvious question: Did Cloudera’s investors incorrectly estimate the potential future value of the company in 2014 if it intends to secure a flat valuation today? It is likely fair to say that Cloudera’s investors were at least partially incorrect about where the company’s value would end up by the first quarter of 2017. No one alive deploys three-quarters of a billion dollars in capital for a flat return over a multi-year period. And doubly, Cloudera may in fact still be overvalued at the proposed $4.1 billion valuation when compared to certain public market comps.Dyson Is the Apple of Appliances (and Just as Secretive): When Michael Aldred joined the British home electronics maker Dyson two decades ago, he had a simple goal: to quickly build a robotic vacuum cleaner. But Mr. Aldred and his team kept running into roadblocks. Their first attempt, unveiled in 2001, was too clunky for James Dyson, the company’s founder. The next prototype involved creating a computer vision system that would allow the machine to skirt independently around furniture; it took more than a decade to perfect. As smartphones became everyday tools, Dyson’s robotics team again had to rethink the vacuum cleaner, adding internet connectivity so the machine could send notifications — with a heat map of where it had cleaned — to a mobile device. After a nearly 20-year odyssey, the robot cleaner, priced at an eye-watering $1,000, finally hit stores worldwide last year. “At times, I really asked myself what I had signed up for,” Mr. Aldred said in an interview at Dyson’s rural headquarters near the border with Wales. “But James Dyson always told us to focus on the product. Everything else would follow.” Not many consumer electronics brands would spend almost two decades — and tens of millions of dollars — building a vacuum cleaner that retails for more than a top-of-the-line laptop. But combining an almost obsessive eye for design and engineering, the privately held Dyson has cornered the nonglamorous market of high-end vacuum cleaners, lights and hair dryers — and in the process bucked the technology truism that companies rarely make money in the difficult arena of hardware. Even as other hardware brands like Samsung, the smartwatch maker Fitbit and the camera designer GoPro have struggled with physical products because of low-priced copycats and thin profit margins, Dyson has shown an uncanny ability to mint money. Its latest robot cleaner, which is selling briskly, exemplifies that and puts Dyson in rarefied company alongside Apple as one of the few tech companies worldwide to consistently profit from consumer gadgets.Why do developers who could work anywhere flock to the world’s most expensive cities? I believe there’s a more fundamental economic divide opening than the one between haves and have-nots. I think we are witnessing a growing rift between the world’s Extremistan cities, in which truly extraordinary things can be achieved, and its Mediocristan towns, in which you van work and make money and be happy but never achieve greatness. (Labels stolen from the great Nassim Taleb) The arts have long had Extremistan cities. That’s why aspiring writers move to New York City, and even directors and actors who found international success are still drawn to L.A. like moths to a klieg light. Now it is true of tech too. Even if you don’t even want to try to (help) build something extraordinary – and the startup myth is so powerful today that it’s a very rare engineer indeed who hasn’t at least dreamed about it – the prospect of being where great things happen is intoxicatingly enticing. But the interesting thing about this is that it could, in theory, change; because — as of quite recently — distributed, decentralized teams can, in fact, achieve extraordinary things. The cards are arguably stacked against them, because VCs tend to be quite myopic. But no law dictates that unicorns may only be born in California, and a handful of other secondary territories; and it seems likely that, for better or worse, Extremistan is spreading. It would be pleasantly paradoxical if that expansion ultimately leads to lower rents in the Mission.Jerks and the Start-Ups They Ruin: The tech industry has a problem with “bro culture.” People have been complaining about it for years. Yet nobody has done much to fix it. That may finally change, if the people in charge of Silicon Valley — venture capitalists, who control the money — start to realize that the real problem with tech bros is not just that they’re boorish jerks. It’s that they’re boorish jerks who don’t know how to run companies. Look at Uber, the ride-hailing start-up. It’s the biggest tech unicorn in the world, with a valuation of $69 billion. Not long ago Uber seemed invincible. Now it’s in free fall, and top executives have fled. The company’s woes spring entirely from its toxic bro culture, created by its chief executive, Travis Kalanick. Bro cos. become corporate frat houses, where employees are chosen like pledges, based on “culture fit.” Women get hired, but they rarely get promoted and sometimes complain of being harassed. Minorities and older workers are excluded. Bro culture also values speedy growth over sustainable profits, and encourages cutting corners, ignoring regulations and doing whatever it takes to win. Sometimes it works. But often the whole thing just flames out. The bros blow through the money and find they have no viable business. For example: Quirky, founded in 2009 by the 20-something Ben Kaufman. It raised $185 million to build a “social product development platform” that sold kooky gadgets, but filed for bankruptcy basically because the “brash” and “unorthodox” chief executive had no business being a chief executive. One indication that Mr. Kaufman is a bro? Well, the first reference he lists on his LinkedIn page is: “He’s a dick … but hilarious.”Elon Musk’s SpaceX makes history by launching a ‘flight-proven’ rocket: From a distance, it looked like any other rocket at Florida’s Kennedy Space Center, a soaring tower of thrust and power, ready to blast off into orbit. Upon closer inspection, though, there were signs of something different about this rocket. The Falcon 9’s first-stage booster was not as clean and shiny as they usually are. It was just a touch dull, showing, ever so slightly, the scorched wear from its first launch, almost a year ago — a “flight-proven” rocket, as Elon Musk’s SpaceX likes to call it. On Thursday evening, almost one year after it had previously flown the Falcon 9 rocket, SpaceX launched it again. The launch, at 6:27 p.m., marked the first time that a rocket had flown a payload to orbit, landed vertically and then been reused. The flight signaled an important landmark, capping years of work and some fiery theatrics of boosters screaming back from space only to explode in failed attempts to land on ships at sea. In December 2015, SpaceX was able to land its first rocket on a landing pad at Cape Canaveral. A few months later, the company did it again, this time at sea. Since then, it has made landing rockets as exciting — or more so — than the 3-2-1, bone-rattling liftoffs of fire and smoke that have reignited interest in space exploration. After the successful launch, an emotional Musk called it “an incredible milestone in the history of space.”Embattled Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey leaves Facebook: Palmer Luckey is out at Facebook. The Oculus co-founder, who helped kickstart the recent VR craze with a prototype headset built out of his parents’ garage, has left the company after a year that heralded the launch of the consumer Oculus Rift but also a number of lawsuits and a pro-Trump meme scandal. Oculus has confirmed the report of Luckey’s departure, first spotted by UploadVR, in a statement to TechCrunch that reads about as much as a eulogy as it does a farewell. In an era filled with seemingly countless examples of “bro” founders emerging from top universities and starting companies with their frat brothers, Luckey appeared to be a breath of fresh air. The home-schooled college dropout was a tinkerer who frequented message boards asking for help taking apart and rebuilding game consoles in his parents’ garage before expanding to a deep interest in 3D screens and head-mounted displays. This fascination eventually brought him to encounter legendary game developer John Carmack, who helped the young Luckey gain the attention of the gaming community after showcasing one of his VR headset prototypes at a major gaming conference. The excitement led to a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign that later brought the interest of some major investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund and Formation 8. Facebook acquired Oculus in March of 2014 for $2 billion. Luckey has not commented on what exactly he earned from the deal, but Forbes pins his net worth at $730 million. Luckey’s departure follows a lengthy period of absence from public view brought about by a Daily Beast piece revealing his involvement and funding of a pro-Trump troll group called Nimble America. News of his support came during a time when very few figures in Silicon Valley were publicly showing support for candidate Trump, the most notable being Peter Thiel, an early investor in Facebook who started the VC firm Founders Fund, which backed Oculus, as well.Samsung launches Galaxy S8 and dreams of recovery from Note 7: Samsung unveiled its Galaxy S8 flagship smartphone as it battles to regain the market leadership it lost to Apple after the embarrassing withdrawal of the fire-prone Note 7s. Boasting some of the largest wrap-around screens ever made, the long-awaited S8 is the South Korean technology company's first new premium phone since its September recall of all Galaxy Note 7 smartphones equipped with fire-prone batteries. Samsung halted their sales in 10 markets, and the phones were banned from aircraft in the United States, denting a revival of the firm's mobile business. Two versions of the Galaxy S8, code-named Dream internally, were launched at a media event in New York on Wednesday, with 6.2-inch (15.75 cm) and 5.8-inch curved screens - the largest to date for Samsung's premium smartphones. They will go on sale on April 21.The S8 features Samsung's new artificial intelligence service, Bixby, with functions including a voice-commanded assistant system similar to Apple's Siri. There is also a new facial recognition application that lets users unlock their phones by looking at them. \"The Galaxy S8 is the most important phone for Samsung in a decade and every aspect will be under the microscope following the Note 7 recall,\" said Ben Wood, a veteran smartphone industry analyst with UK-based CCS Insight.It sounds like Munchery’s early investors are screwed: Munchery, an on-demand food delivery startup that has already raised more than $120 million, is reportedly looking to raise an additional $15 million in funding that would force a recapitalization of the company, Bloomberg reports. Munchery reportedly has raised more than $5 million in this new financing. As part of the recapitalization, Munchery issued shares to new investors in the form of a convertible note, which can later be exchanged for equity in the result of another equity raise or liquidity event. One person told Bloomberg that the valuation on the note is capped at $80 million. Munchery’s last round of funding was an $85 million Series C, which valued the company at around $300 million. So Munchery wouldn’t be valued at more than about a quarter of what it once was. This new deal essentially wipes out the stakes of pre-existing investors and early Munchery employees. Recapitalizations generally happen when the company can’t find outside investors to drive the valuation further up, so it resets the cap table and starts from scratch. Munchery has had a rough last 12 months, between scathing reports of the company wasting an average of 16% of the food it makes, laying off 30 employees, and burning through most of the money it’s raised.Pandora is in trouble, and Big Music is surprisingly sad about that: Pandora’s days seem numbered. And the music business isn’t happy about that. Pandora, once a music streaming pioneer, now looks like a music streaming casualty. While competitors like Spotify and Apple Music are booming, Pandora has been treading water. Pandora’s management is under investor pressure, yet again, to explain why they shouldn’t sell the company. Sirius XM remains, as always, the logical buyer. The new, new thing is that Big Music — the music labels and publishers that dominate the industry — aren’t gleeful about that prospect. That’s a change from years past, when Pandora was the company the music guys loved to hate, because Pandora had figured out how to build a big streaming music service without charging for music, and without making deals with Big Music. Instead, Pandora took advantage of U.S. copyright rules that let them pay a set price for each song they streamed, without ever negotiating with the labels and without ever charging consumers. You will not be surprised to know that the Big Music guys argued that Pandora built a multi-billion dollar business with their stuff without giving them their proper cut. But that was then! Now, things are different in two significant ways: Pandora ended up negotiating licenses directly with the big guys. Pandora now plans to launch a subscription service, which will mirror the ones sold by the likes of Spotify and Apple Music. “They’ve seen the light,” said a Big Music executive, explaining why the industry would like to see Pandora stay afloat.Tencent of China Takes 5 Percent Stake in Tesla: Tencent Holdings, one of China’s internet giants, has acquired a 5 percent stake in Elon Musk’s electric-car maker Tesla, according to a filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday. The purchase of 8.17 million shares makes the Chinese company one of Tesla’s largest shareholders. Tencent, whose internet empire includes businesses as diverse as online games and chat services, paid $1.8 billion for the stake, according to the filing. Shares of Tesla rose 3 percent in early trading in New York. The purchase came as Tesla has recently sought to raise more cash before it begins production of its Model 3, an electric vehicle targeting the mass market. Tesla has previously focused on higher-end electric vehicles that begin around $91,000, and the introduction of the Model 3 will probably represent a significant increase in production for the carmaker. The company expects to make 5,000 Model 3s a week in the fourth quarter, and 10,000 a week at some point in 2018, according to a shareholder letter. This month, Tesla, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said it would sell $250 million of common stock and $750 million of convertible senior notes. Tencent controls WeChat, the popular messaging service in China. It also reached a deal last year to take control of Supercell, the maker of the popular Clash of Clans game.Silicon Valley Startups Favor IPOs Over Deals as M&A Languishes: Until recently, startups could count on generous private funding, with the associated generous implied valuations, and avoid the perceived hassle of being accountable to public investors. If a company had both exit options on the table -- an IPO or an outright sale -- the sale option looked attractive. The pendulum is starting to swing the other way, according to Lise Buyer, founder of IPO advisory firm Class V Group.The shift is at least partly due to the success of some recent listings, Buyer said. That includes Snap Inc.’s IPO, which was 10 times oversubscribed, people familiar with the matter have said, and has soared as much as 59 percent above its IPO price. Cloud-software maker MuleSoft Inc. jumped 46 percent in its debut this month. “People get excited about the last transaction,” she said. “It’s a bit of, ‘What has the market done for me lately?’” Since September, 17 U.S. technology and communications companies have raised $6.3 billion through IPOs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with 13 companies that raised $4.6 billion in the year-earlier period. The four new 2017 stocks have gained an average of 31 percent, outpacing the 4.6 percent climb in the S&P 500 Index, the data show. Okta, which was valued at $1.2 billion in its most recent private financing round in 2015, filed for an IPO after about a year-long effort to sell itself. No suitors were willing to pay more than $1 billion to acquire the eight-year-old software maker, people familiar with the matter said.BlackRock cuts fees and jobs; stockpicking goes high-tech: BlackRock Inc on Tuesday said it would overhaul its actively managed equities business, cutting jobs, dropping fees and relying more on computers to pick stocks in a move that highlights how difficult it has become for humans to beat the market. The world's biggest money manager has faced active stock fund withdrawals and the revamp is its biggest attempt yet to engineer a turnaround. Last May, BlackRock said it had recruited Mark Wiseman, the head of Canada's biggest public pension fund, to oversee the stockpicking operations after he revamped that fund's operations to embrace data-mining and other technological approaches to investing. BlackRock is rebranding or adjusting investment strategies on about 11 percent of its $275 billion active stock fund business, putting a greater emphasis on technology-driven investing approaches in the largest set of sweeping changes for the business since transformational mergers that allowed it to grow to manage more than $5 trillion in assets. Among the changes, BlackRock is removing some seven traditionalist \"Fundamental\" portfolio managers from their current assignments, according to a source familiar with the matter. More than 40 employees are being laid off, including some of the portfolio managers, according to another source.Dyson's Latest Cordless Vacuums Drive Sales Past $3 Billion: Dyson Ltd. continues to prove making high-priced vacuum cleaners is a lucrative and growing business.The closely held U.K. firm said total sales grew 45 percent in 2016, to 2.5 billion pounds ($3.12 billion), largely due to demand for a new line of battery-powered cordless cleaners. The models, first introduced two years ago and costing about 500 pounds each, are the fastest-selling vacuums in the company’s 25-year history. Dyson’s profit excluding some costs surged 41 percent to 631 million pounds.The new vacuum design moves the device’s motor to near the hand grip, allowing it to double as a traditional upright vacuum or a handheld cleaner to suck up debris in harder-to-reach spaces. Dyson, with about 3,500 employees, has for years been expanding beyond vacuum cleaners, with air purifiers, heaters, fans and robots. A new hair dryerthat took four years and $70 million to develop was introduced last year. The company has committed to spending 2.5 billion pounds on future technologies, including artificial intelligence and robotics. Among Dyson’s biggest bets are batteries. Last year, the company said it would spend 1 billion pounds on research over the next five years. In 2015, it acquired the maker of solid state batteries Sakti3 for $90 million.Uber Self-Driving Car Tests Resume Three Days After Crash: Uber’s self-driving cars were back on public roads Monday, three days after a crash in Arizona put the company’s testing program on hold. The ride-hailing company resumed testing in San Francisco Monday morning, and planned to restart the program in Tempe, Arizona, and Pittsburgh later in the day, according to an Uber spokeswoman. One of Uber’s Volvo self-driving SUVs was involved in a high-impact crash on Friday in Tempe. The vehicle was not responsible for the incident and there were no injuries, Tempe police said. Another car failed to yield for the Uber car, causing the autonomous vehicle to flip on its side, according to the police report. Uber paused testing after the incident over the weekend to better understand what happened. The company said it was confident in returning the vehicles to the road on Monday.Snap surges after IPO banks give flurry of 'buy' ratings: Shares of Snap Inc jumped nearly 5 percent on Monday after several of the Snapchat owner's IPO underwriters handed it badly needed \"buy\" ratings. Snap's initial public offering on March 1 was the largest by a technology firm in three years but trading has been volatile, with many investors critical of decelerating user growth. Snap has warned it may never become profitable. Analysts unrelated to the IPO had in recent weeks mostly assigned neutral or negative ratings to Snap, making it one of the worst-rated stocks on Wall Street. But on Monday, at least eight banks involved in Snap's IPO gave it positive ratings, including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Its stock rose 4.79 percent to end at $23.83. That left Snap up 37 percent from its $17 initial public offer price, but still down more than $3 from its peak in its second day of trading. The Los Angeles-based company's app, which allows users to share short-lived messages and pictures, is popular with young people. But it faces intense competition from larger rivals like Facebook Inc.Theranos is offering investors Elizabeth Holmes’ shares if they promise not to sue: One way Theranos is hoping to stay afloat is by offering double the shares — including some of founder Elizabeth Holmes’ own shares — to investors if they promise not to sue. Theranos is knee-deep in an avalanche of lawsuits from investors and consumers of its blood-testing products after it was discovered last year the tests had an accuracy problem and didn’t meet with the company’s own standards. Its main partner, Walgreens, has since pulled out and is also suing the company. According to The Wall Street Journal, Theranos’ board approved a move in February to shuffle shares, including from founder Elizabeth Holmes, to investors as a way to appease them. It’s not clear how many shares Holmes is offering up herself, but at least a couple of investors aren’t taking the deal. Theranos has reached a separate agreement with Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc., who refused to agree to the same deal as other investors — possibly for tax reasons. Theranos will instead buy back his shares for $1, according to the Journal’s sources. Another investor, San Francisco-based hedge fund Partner Fund Management LP, which sued Theranos in October and participated in the $198 Series C round attributed to have driven Theranos to its former $9 billion valuation, also refused the agreement.Amazon.com wins $1.5 billion tax dispute over IRS:  Amazon.com Inc on Thursday won a more than $1.5 billion tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over transactions involving a Luxembourg unit more than a decade ago. Judge Albert Lauber of the U.S. Tax Court rejected a variety of IRS arguments, and found that on several occasions the agency abused its discretion, or acted arbitrarily or capriciously. Amazon's ultimate tax liability from the decision was not immediately clear. The world's largest online retailer has said the case involved transactions in 2005 and 2006, and could boost its federal tax bill by $1.5 billion plus interest. It also said a loss could add \"significant\" tax liabilities in later years. Amazon made just $2.37 billion of profit in 2016, four times what it made in the four prior years combined, on revenue of $136 billion.Uber stalls India leasing scheme as driver incomes drop: sources: Global ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies is rethinking its car leasing strategy in India, its second-biggest market, as drivers have returned dozens of leased cars early after the company cut incentives, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Uber had planned to buy 15,000 new cars last year and lease them out in a bid to attract more drivers - a strategy it has used in other markets - but it suspended the scheme for a while in December after leasing just a third of that total. After burning through millions of dollars over three years in a battle for market share with local rival Ola, backed by Japan's Softbank, Uber has cut the incentives it gives to drivers and raised the fares it charges passengers.Two people with knowledge of the matter said Uber miscalculated the impact that the reduced incentives would have on drivers' earnings, especially those making lease payments.To lease a new small car through Uber's scheme, drivers pay a 33,000 rupee ($499) deposit - less than what they would pay to buy a car from a dealer with a bank loan. But weekly payments of about 5,500 rupees over three years add up to nearly double what drivers would pay to service a car loan.That wasn't an issue when incentives were high. Several Uber drivers said they feel trapped as a surge in the number of cars on Uber's platform has led to fewer rides, at a time when incentives have been cut, making it harder to keep up lease payments.China Bets on Sensitive U.S. Start-Ups, Worrying the Pentagon: When the United States Air Force wanted help making military robots more perceptive, it turned to a Boston-based artificial intelligence start-up called Neurala. But when Neurala needed money, it got little response from the American military. So Neurala turned to China, landing an undisclosed sum from an investment firm backed by a state-run Chinese company. Chinese firms have become significant investors in American start-ups working on cutting-edge technologies with potential military applications. The start-ups include companies that make rocket engines for spacecraft, sensors for autonomous navy ships, and printers that make flexible screens that could be used in fighter-plane cockpits. Many of the Chinese firms are owned by state-owned companies or have connections to Chinese leaders. The deals are ringing alarm bells in Washington. According to a new white paper commissioned by the Department of Defense, Beijing is encouraging Chinese companies with close government ties to invest in American start-ups specializing in critical technologies like artificial intelligence and robots to advance China’s military capacity as well as its economy.What happened to tablet sales? In the past month, both Apple and Samsung have refreshed their flagship tablets for the first time since 2014. A lot has changed in the space in the intervening years — mostly for the worse, as overall sales have continued to slip. In Q4 of last year, IDC reported that shipments had dropped 20 percent, year over year, while Strategic Analytics has the number at half that. There’s room for debate as far as precisely how down the overall market is (not to mention what precisely qualifies a device as a tablet), but there seems to at least be a consensus that early predictions of the tablet space eclipsing PCs missed the mark. The space has suffered for a variety of reasons. Among them, the fact that users simply aren’t refreshing tablets at a rate many manufacturers no doubt predicted. “The iPad 2 is still in use today,” IDC Senior Analyst Jitesh Ubrani tells TechCrunch. “The [original] iPad Minis and Air are all still in use today. They were being supported by Apple until very recently. People have been hanging onto these devices and they’re finding that they work just as well as they did when they were released.” There are a few reasons for this. For one thing, users haven’t been conditioned to upgrade slates on the same cycle as smartphone — something that’s been hammered into consumers in almost Pavlovian fashion through carrier upgrade cycles. There’s also the simple fact that we tend not to put the devices through the same sort of day to day wear and tear of smartphones, or even laptops, with many users simply leaving their devices at home and breaking them out when it’s time to watch some Netflix. The growing size of smartphone displays has gone a ways toward cannibalizing tablet sales, as well, limiting the need for a much larger device when so many handsets are now within the six-inch range. Tiger Global may be part-exiting Flipkart with 3x return: Tiger Global, the biggest investor in Flipkart, may have struck a deal with Microsoft and other new investors to sell a part of its stake in the e-commerce company in the latest fund-raising round that valued it at $9.3 billion pre-money, a person familiar with the conversations told VCCircle. While US online retailer eBay, Chinese tech major Tencent and Microsoft are investing $500 million each in the round, the part-sale of Tiger’s shares would mean Flipkart is still short of the $1.5 billion it was targeting to raise in this round. That means either one of the three would put in additional money, or a fourth investor—potentially Google Capital—would help Flipkart close the round within a few weeks, added the person cited above. The part-sale of its Flipkart stake aligns with Tiger Global’s strategy to book some gains before actively investing in the country again, VCCircle had reported earlier. It is part of its broader plans to monetise stakes in its major bets, such as Flipkart, Ola and Quikr, in the near term. The secondary transaction of Flipkart shares between Tiger Global and Microsoft would result in the former’s stake in the company decreasing to around 25%, from the current 33-35%, depending on the deal size. This would also mean Tiger getting some of its money back—the firm is believed to have invested around $1 billion in Flipkart. This part-exit would mean three-fold return for Tiger Global’s biggest investment in India, better than some of its poor exits such as Caratlane last year, where it practically made no gains at all. Except MakeMyTrip and JustDial, Tiger has seen no impressive exits in India yet.Foursquare is launching an analytics platform to help retailers understand foot traffic: While Foursquare started as a social check-in app, the company has always said there is a bigger picture — mainly related to unique ways of leveraging its database of check-ins at nearly 100 million public places. There’s no better example than when Foursquare predicted that Chipotle same-store sales would fall 29 percent after the Mexican chain was hit with E. coli outbreaks. The actual decline announced by Chipotle ended up being a spot-on 30 percent. As you can imagine, these analytics can be very valuable to retailers, allowing them to better understand customers’ habits as well as predict store traffic. So today the company is announcing Foursquare Analytics, a foot-traffic dashboard for brands and retailers. The platform is available for retailers with any number of stores, no matter how small. Previously the only way for companies to access this data was through one-off deals with Foursquare. Retailers will be able to use the dashboard to see foot-traffic data across metrics like gender, age and new versus returning customers — on a national or citywide scale. They also can compare their foot traffic against a set of competitors and their category as a whole. The data is collected via Foursquare’s existing database of locations (which powers more than 100,000 apps, including Snapchat), as well as anonymized in-store-visit data collected from users of Swarm and Foursquare who have opted in to always-on location sharing. Foursquare then normalizes this data to make sure it accurately represents the U.S. population as a whole.Ant Financial Said Considering Higher Offer for MoneyGram: Billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Financial is considering whether to make a higher offer for MoneyGram International Inc., according to a person familiar with the negotiations, after the U.S. company said a smaller rival’s bid could be a better deal. In January, China-based Ant Financial announced its plan to acquire MoneyGram for $13.25 a share in cash, pending regulatory approval. Last week, Euronet Worldwide Inc. swooped in with a $15.20-a-share offer, a proposition that “could reasonably be expected” to result in a superior proposal, Dallas-based MoneyGram said Monday in a statement. Douglas Feagin, Ant’s head of international operations, said he’s “confident” that the deal will go through. It’s likely that Ant Financial will either counter the bid with a higher offer, or say that it will wait until Euronet finishes carrying out its due diligence before delivering a rival bid, according to a person familiar with the negotiations. If MoneyGram declares Euronet’s bid superior, Ant will have four days to respond. MoneyGram’s shares rose 0.9 percent to $16.43 at the close in New York. They have more than doubled in the past year.Vodafone-Idea merger: Birth of a telecom giant: Facing intense competition from cash-rich Reliance Jio, the Aditya Birla Group and British telecom giant Vodafone Plc on Monday announced the merger of their Indian wireless telephony businesses, creating the largest telecom operator in the country. In a news conference in Mumbai, Vodafone Group Plc Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Vittorio Colao and Aditya Birla Group Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said the merger would create a new champion of digital India. It would launch new services soon. As the first step of the merger, Birla-owned Idea Cellular and Vodafone India would merge their operations at a swap ratio of 1:1. Then, Birla’s holding companies would buy a 4.9 per cent stake from Vodafone at Rs 110 per share, investing close to Rs 3,900 crore. This will increase Idea’s stake to 26 per cent and bring down Vodafone Plc’s stake to 45.1 per cent. The Birlas would have the right to acquire another 9.5 per cent stake from Vodafone in the next four years, so that both partners eventually hold an equal stake in the company (about 35.5 per cent each). “India was earlier the jewel in our crown. Now with this merger, we have got a bigger jewel,” Colao said, adding: “This is our Make in India initiative.” At present, Vodafone and Idea together have a customer base of 400 million. Their joint revenue share is likely be 41 per cent, after the merger is complete at the end of 2018. Bharti Airtel, which used to be the biggest market player till now, will be a distant second, with 268 million customers in India. Revenue-wise, too, Airtel would be on the second spot with a market share of 35.6 per cent, along with Telenor. Airtel and Telenor are planning to merge their operations. nvestors of Idea Cellular, however, were not happy with the transaction; its shares closed with a 9.55 per cent fall at Rs 97.6 a share after the deal was announced. Birla said the investors’ reaction was a “knee-jerk” one. He was confident that like other Birla group mergers and acquisitions, investors would gain in the long run. Analysts said the consolidation in the telecom sector, triggered by Jio’s $25-billion (about Rs 1.7 lakh crore) investment, was likely to continue. Uber president Jeff Jones quits, deepening turmoil: Ride services company Uber Technologies has been thrust deeper into turmoil with the departure of company president Jeff Jones, a marketing expert hired to help soften its often abrasive image. Jones quit less than seven months after joining the San Francisco company, an Uber spokesman said on Sunday. The reason for his departure was not immediately clear, but Jones' role was put into question after Uber earlier this month launched a search for a chief operating officer to help run the company alongside Chief Executive Travis Kalanick. Jones is the latest in a string of high-level executives to leave the company. Last month, engineering executive Amit Singhal was asked to resign due to a sexual harassment allegation stemming from his previous job at Alphabet Inc's Google. Earlier this month, Ed Baker, Uber's vice president of product and growth, and Charlie Miller, Uber's famed security researcher, departed. Uber, while it has long had a reputation as an aggressive and unapologetic startup, has been battered with multiple controversies over the last several weeks that have put Kalanick's leadership capabilities and the company's future into question. A former Uber employee last month published a blog post describing a workplace where sexual harassment was common and went unpunished. The blog post prompted an internal investigation that is being led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Then, Bloomberg released a video that showed Kalanick berating an Uber driver who had complained about cuts to rates paid to drivers, resulting in Kalanick making a public apology. And earlier this month Uber confirmed it had used a secret technology program dubbed \"Greyball,\" which effectively changes the app view for specific riders, to evade authorities in cities where the service has been banned. Uber has since prohibited the use of Greyball to target local regulators.At Peter Thiel’s Palantir, Allegations of Theft and Deception: Marc Abramowitz thought he’d found kindred spirits in the founders of Palantir Technologies Inc. Like Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp and billionaire Chairman Peter Thiel, Abramowitz was a Stanford University alumnus looking to build a business empire. In 2006, Abramowitz made an investment in their then unknown startup and became a regular around the office. In recent years, Palantir has risen to be a global data mining giant with a $20 billion valuation. Abramowitz’s shares are estimated to be worth $60 million. But his relationship with the founders has turned toxic, and they now have competing lawsuits in two states. Abramowitz’s suit was filed last week in Delaware’s Chancery Court, saying Palantir thwarted his efforts to sell shares and that the company must disclose its books and records. Bloomberg has obtained an unredacted copy of the suit, which hasn’t been previously reported. It alleges that Palantir blocked a planned sale of Abramowitz’s shares to Chinese private equity firm CDH Investments Fund Management Co. and that Palantir violated an agreement with Abramowitz to provide him with quarterly financial statements and access to shareholder meetings. Palantir, which sued Abramowitz in September for attempting to claim patent ownership for the company’s work, said the new suit is without merit. It said it shouldn’t have to disclose information about its inner-workings or finances because Abramowitz’s interests are at odds with the company’s. “This lawsuit is nothing more than a blatant attempt to distract from Mr. Abramowitz’s unlawful and egregious theft of our intellectual property,” Palantir wrote in an emailed statement.How Google and Levi’s smart jacket shows what’s coming next for wearables: Google and Levi's showed off this week a new joint project: a $350 smart jean jacket. While this jacket literally puts tech on your sleeve, it does it in a subtle way that doesn't require putting another screen on your body. In doing so, it offers a glimpse of what smart fabrics can do and of the evolution of the wearables market -- one in which consumers won't have to wear a clunky accessory that screams high tech. The smart Commuter jacket, which was introduced over the weekend at SXSW in Austin, is aimed at those who bike to work. It has technology woven into its fibers, and allows users to take phone calls, get directions and check the time, by tapping and swiping their sleeves. That delivers information to them through their headphones so that they can keep their eyes on the road without having to fiddle with a screen. The jacket the should hit stores this fall. Its smart fibers are washable; they're powered by a sort of smart cufflink that you'll have to remove when you wash the jacket. The cufflink has a two-day battery life. Wearables are expected to be a $19 billion industry by 2018, according to Juniper Research. Products including Fitbit fitness trackers, Android Wear watches and the Apple Watch have helped fuel a rise in mainstream awareness of wearables for the past several years, even leading Fitbit to go public in 2015. But the market for wearables has taken a bit of a tumble in the past few quarters. Fitbit in January announced it had missed earnings expectations and starting cutting jobs because sales were lower than expected. It's hard to say exactly what has caused the cool-down in wearables, but one possibility is that the market for uber-techy wearables that try to put a smartwatch on your wrist is pretty saturated. Analysts have pointed to a shift in the market away from the super-functional smartwatch toward gadgets that are a little more focused and better looking to boot.Airbnb raises $1 billion in latest round of funding: Online room renting service Airbnb Inc said on Thursday it had raised $1 billion in its latest round of funding, valuing the company at $31 billion.The company turned in a profit on an EBITDA basis in the second half of 2016 and expects to continue to be profitable this year, the source said, adding that Airbnb had no plans to go public anytime soon. The company is locked in an intensifying global battle with regulators who say the service takes affordable housing off the market and drives up rental prices.Airbnb raised $447.85 million as part of the funding, a source close to the company told Reuters. The company said in September it had raised about $555 million as part of the same round of funding. Airbnb, which operates in more than 65,000 cities, has enjoyed tremendous growth as it pushes ahead with its plans of global expansion.Alibaba seeks $5 billion loan amid tech financing rush: Basis Point: Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is in talks with banks to raise $5 billion in new funding, sources told Thomson Reuters' Basis Point, amid a flurry of fund-raising by China's tech giants. Alibaba is looking to raises the funds offshore via a bullet loan with a five-year maturity, with the aim of using the proceeds for general corporate purposes including refinancing, the sources said. The plan comes as key rival Tencent Holdings looks to raise up to $2 billion in new debt funding, with competition heating up amongst the country's Internet firms domestically and overseas.Wikileaks' CIA hacking dump sends tech firms scrambling for fixes: Tech companies must rapidly step up information-sharing to protect users from prying eyes, a security software executive said on Wednesday after WikiLeaks released a trove of data purporting to show that the CIA can hack all manner of devices. Dozens of firms rushed to contain the damage from possible security weak points following the anti-secrecy organization's revelations, although some said they needed far more information on what the U.S. intelligence agency was up to before they could thwart suspected but previously hidden attacks. Sinan Eren, vice president of Czech anti-virus software maker Avast, called on mobile software makers Apple and Google to supply security firms with privileged access to their devices to offer immediate fixes to known bugs. Avast, which counts more than 400 million users of its anti-virus software worldwide, was named in the WikiLeaks documents as one of the security vendors targeted by the CIA in a leaked page labeled \"secret\" but lacking further details. The leaks - which WikiLeaks described as the biggest in the Central Intelligence Agency's history - had enough technical details for security experts and product vendors to recognize that widespread compromises exist. However, they provided few specifics needed to offer quick fixes. The 8,761 leaked documents list a wealth of security attacks on Apple and Google Android smartphones carried by billions of consumers, as well as top computer operating systems - Windows, Linux and Apple Mac - and six of the world's main web browsers.Valuation Shell Game: Silicon Valley’s Dirty Secret: You want to know the dirty, little secret of Silicon Valley? It’s called the 409A valuation. Here’s how the process works: In order to attract and to retain high-powered employees, high-flying tech companies want to issue them common stock or options. To do so and to comply with Internal Revenue Service rules, they need to obtain an independent, third-party valuation of the company. This type of valuation allows hot, privately owned technology companies — like Uber, Airbnb or Nextdoor — to issue common stock or stock options to employees at a low price and, at the same time, or nearly the same time, sell preferred stock to outside investors at a price that is often three or four times higher. It’s also a way for company founders to control the market for the stock of their private companies while rewarding themselves and key employees with cheap shares that seem instantly worth a lot more than the price at which they were issued. Failure to comply with section 409A of the tax code would make employees receiving the stock grants personally liable for immediate taxation on the excess value embedded in the stock or options, plus a 20 percent penalty tax. The valuations also give the founders of technology companies extraordinary control over the market for the private sale of company stock. Whether employees realize it or not, the stock the company grants to them often explicitly prevents its sale to anyone, or in any private secondary market, without the express written consent of the founder, the chief executive or the board of directors. Obviously this becomes a problem when an employee wants to sell his or her private stock. And who wouldn’t, if for instance, the stock is issued to employees at a $500 million valuation, and then sold to outside investors at a $1.5 billion valuation. This is often the point where the founder steps in and says, sorry, no sale, or at least not at the higher valuation. Selling implies the person is no longer a true believer in the company or in its mission. This dynamic falls especially hard on early investors who are not company employees, those so-called “series A” or “series B” venture-capital investors who would like to sell at the higher valuation but can do so only with the founder’s or chief executive’s permission and only at the sanctioned valuation. Employees looking to diversify their wealth also often feel frustrated.Instacart, Now $400 Million Richer, Tries to Be Thrifty: Apoorva Mehta is thinking a lot about bottle deposits. Recycling fees vary by state and container size, but until recently, Mehta’s online grocery delivery startup Instacart Inc. hadn’t paid much attention to what it was charging customers purchasing soda or beer. Then they did the math and discovered that this oversight was costing the company on average 35 cents a delivery. Instacart now charges the correct amount for bottle deposits. In the last year, it made a similar adjustment to how it accounts for local sales taxes, which has saved another 20 cents per delivery, according to the company. The penny-pinching is part of a new strategy designed to show investors that Instacart can rise above the pile of on-demand startups that have bled venture capital. Enough VCs were convinced by Mehta’s pitch to contribute $400 million for Instacart’s latest round of funding. With the additional cash, the investment increases the company’s valuation to $3.4 billion, an unlikely harvest in a down market. “This is not what I’ll call ‘funny math’ here,” said Mehta, the co-founder and chief executive officer. “One of the things we’ve had as a result of this round is a lot of scrutiny from the smartest investors in the world, looking at a lot of these numbers in detail.” Mehta wants everyone to know that unlike a typical startup newly awash in cash, Instacart is going to spend it very carefully. The San Francisco-based company, which pays workers to pick up and deliver groceries from local supermarkets, is also eager to demonstrate that it’s taking in more revenue while spending less. Instacart cut its burn rate by more than half in the past year, Mehta said. In addition to the bottle deposit and sales tax adjustments, the company focused on driving down “time per delivery,” a metric that’s the source of some obsession within the walls of Instacart. For inspiration, the company filmed its most efficient shoppers to learn what they did differently and then taught those lessons to new recruits. Quicker deliveries translate not only into happier customers but cost savings resulting from higher productivity.Instacart Raises Funding Valuing Grocery Startup at $3.4 Billion: Online grocery delivery startup Instacart Inc. has raised a $400 million round of venture funding, said people familiar with the deal. With the additional capital, the San Francisco-based company’s valuation has risen to $3.4 billion, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter isn’t public. The investment was led by Sequoia Capital, which had led an earlier round, the people said. Instacart allows customers to shop through an app at local grocery stores. Orders are then picked off shelves and delivered by Instacart workers, who are a mix of part-time employees and independent contractors. Before the latest fundraising discussions, Instacart had been valued at $2 billion after a 2015 funding round. Wrapify raises $3M from Avery Dennison to pay you to wrap your car in ads: Wrapify, the startup that will pay you to wrap your car with an advertisement, has raised $3 million in seed funding. As a refresher, the startup provides a two-sided marketplace that matches up drivers wanting to make some extra money with brands looking for a unique way to advertise. Eligible drivers will get their car wrap installed (and removed) for free, and on average are paid $450 a month for the duration of their campaign. The entire round of funding will come from Avery Dennison, the global manufacturer of adhesive materials. Interestingly, Avery Dennison is the manufacturer of the wraps that Wrapify uses on all of its cars. While the adhesive manufacturer has already provided Wrapify exclusive access to new adhesive wrap technology (wraps with fast installability and removability) that better fit the startup’s use case of short-term installations, being on the cap table should incentivize them to continue investing in wrap technology that will allow Wrapify to operate more efficiently.Google may have missed a big chance to become a major smartphone maker: Since its October launch, Google's Pixel phone has received rave reviews, and Google recently confirmed to the Android-focused publication Android Pit that it will release a new Pixel this year. Yet despite these successes, it seems the phone may be experiencing some trouble on the sales front and may have missed an opportunity to capitalize on competitors' missteps. While Google doesn't break out its numbers for Pixel units sold, analysts estimate that customers bought around 552,000 Pixel phones by the end of 2016, according to USA Today. In comparison, Apple sold 78 million iPhones between late September and December. Samsung sold 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 phones between its mid-August launch and its October discontinuation. To put that in perspective, Google's market share for smartphones shipped is now less than one percent worldwide — as compared to Samsung's 18 percent and Apple's 18.2 percent — said Ramon Llamas, a research manager for the analysis firm International Data Corporation. On paper, it seemed like it should have been a slam dunk for Google given the Pixel's Google branding, Samsung's Note 7 problems, and criticism of Apple's latest iPhones not being that revolutionary. The Pixel is a solid phone thanks to its quality construction, pure version of Android and special Google features such as the voice-controlled Assistant. The big problem for Pixel is that only one carrier, Verizon, sells the phone, said Jeff Moore of research firm Wave7 Research. While users can get it directly from Google for full price of $649 — and take it to another carrier if they want — that's not an option that a majority of wireless customers think about. Compounding the availability issue, Moore said, is that stores are having trouble keeping the phones in stock. That's a good sign for Google in terms of demand, but also a bad sign for the company in terms of being able to capitalize on that demand, he said.How Uber Deceives the Authorities Worldwide: Uber has for years engaged in a worldwide program to deceive the authorities in markets where its low-cost ride-hailing service was resisted by law enforcement or, in some instances, had been banned. The program, involving a tool called Greyball, uses data collected from the Uber app and other techniques to identify and circumvent officials who were trying to clamp down on the ride-hailing service. Uber used these methods to evade the authorities in cities like Boston, Paris and Las Vegas, and in countries like Australia, China and South Korea. Greyball was part of a program called VTOS, short for “violation of terms of service,” which Uber created to root out people it thought were using or targeting its service improperly. The program, including Greyball, began as early as 2014 and remains in use, predominantly outside the United States. Greyball was approved by Uber’s legal team. Greyball and the VTOS program were described to The New York Times by four current and former Uber employees, who also provided documents. The four spoke on the condition of anonymity because the tools and their use are confidential and because of fear of retaliation by Uber. One technique involved drawing a digital perimeter, or “geofence,” around the government offices on a digital map of a city that Uber was monitoring. The company watched which people were frequently opening and closing the app — a process known internally as eyeballing — near such locations as evidence that the users might be associated with city agencies. Other techniques included looking at a user’s credit card information and determining whether the card was tied directly to an institution like a police credit union.Enforcement officials involved in large-scale sting operations meant to catch Uber drivers would sometimes buy dozens of cellphones to create different accounts. To circumvent that tactic, Uber employees would go to local electronics stores to look up device numbers of the cheapest mobile phones for sale, which were often the ones bought by city officials working with budgets that were not large. In all, there were at least a dozen or so signifiers in the VTOS program that Uber employees could use to assess whether users were regular new riders or probably city officials. If such clues did not confirm a user’s identity, Uber employees would search social media profiles and other information available online. If users were identified as being linked to law enforcement, Uber Greyballed them by tagging them with a small piece of code that read “Greyball” followed by a string of numbers. When someone tagged this way called a car, Uber could scramble a set of ghost cars in a fake version of the app for that person to see, or show that no cars were available. Occasionally, if a driver accidentally picked up someone tagged as an officer, Uber called the driver with instructions to end the ride.NBCUniversal invests $500 million in Snap's IPO: Comcast Corp's (CMCSA.O) NBCUniversal has invested $500 million in Snapchat owner Snap Inc (SNAP.N), according to a memo on Friday, its latest move aimed at driving digital growth as more viewers go online for their favorite content. Like other traditional U.S. media companies, NBCU is pushing more into digital media, and over the past 18 months it has invested $400 million in online publisher Buzzfeed and $200 million in Vox Media, operator of The Verge and Recode news.NBCUniversal has agreed to hold Snap's shares for at least a year, according to CNBC. Snap disclosed last month that it expected investors buying up to a quarter of its shares in the IPO to agree not to sell them for a year. Lock-up periods help companies moderate stock volatility by preventing company insiders from selling their shares within an allotted time.Snap Shares Leap 44% in Debut as Investors Doubt Value Will Vanish: Snapchat is a business built in large part on disappearing messages and adding animated dog ears and flower crowns to users’ selfies. As of Thursday, that business is worth about $34 billion — more than the market value of the old-line media company CBS, and about three times the size of another social media company, Twitter. Snapchat has made paper billionaires of its 20-something founders five times over. In making its stock market debut in spectacular fashion — its shares rising 44 percent on their first day of trading — Snapchat’s parent, Snap Inc., has blazed a trail for other technology darlings like Uber and Spotify that remain privately held. It elated Wall Street institutions eager for a prominent initial public offering when few had surfaced for months. The company has entranced investors despite a litany of red flags, like enormous losses that are expected to persist for years, a slowdown in its once-vaunted user growth rates, and an ownership structure that gives Snapchat’s founders control for decades to come.Snap Prices I.P.O. at $17 a Share, Valuing Company at $24 Billion: Millennials, those 14 to 35 years old, may be as exuberantly hyped a demographic as any in recent memory. That generation has now helped power one of the biggest and most eagerly awaited stock market debuts in recent memory, making billionaires of the founders of the disappearing-message service Snapchat. Investors, attracted by Snapchat’s hold on its millennial users — who check the app on average more than 18 times a day — flocked to the initial public offering, pushing the parent company, Snap Inc., to a valuation of nearly $24 billion. The stock sale sets Snap up as the most valuable American technology company to go public since Facebook nearly five years ago. And it may herald a coming wave of unicorns — technology start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by private investors — that are expected to hit the public markets in the next few years. Snap’s offering was priced on Wednesday at $17 a share — a dollar more than the previously expected pricing range. The pricing came on a day when the stock market surged to another high, fed by raised expectations of tax cuts, looser regulations and higher interest rates under the Trump administration. Shares of the social media companies Facebook and Twitter also rose. Those buying into Snap’s offering did so even as warning signs have flashed over the company, based in California. It lost more than $500 million last year, and its explosive user growth appears to have hit a speed bump. And in a decision that has angered some large investors, the shares will have no voting rights, leaving control in the hands of the company’s founders, who can retain that power for years even after leaving Snap. Yet when Snap begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, under the ticker name SNAP, it will command a lofty valuation multiple even richer than that of Facebook, which earned $10 billion last year. With a market value of almost $24 billion, including unvested stock options and grants, the company is now setting itself up with little room for error.Instacart In Talks to Raise About $400 Million: Grocery-delivery startup Instacart is said to be in talks with investors to raise about $400 million, more than two years after its last major round of funding.The new funding would value the San Francisco company at $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The startup, which uses workers to pick groceries off the shelves of stores such as Whole Foods and deliver them to customers' doorsteps, previously raised funding in January 2015 at a $2 billion valuation. Sequoia Capital, which already has a stake in Instacart, is likely to lead the round, one of the people said. A year ago, Instacart Chief Executive Officer Apoorva Mehta told Bloomberg that the company had a plan for becoming sustainable, and he didn't expect to raise funding again in the future.In Video, Uber CEO Argues With Driver Over Falling Fares: “I don’t know if you remember me, but it’s fine,” Kamel says. The pair begin talking shop, and Kalanick explains that they’re going to cut down on the number of black cars, which will reduce competition and should be good for Kamel. Then Kamel says what every driver has been dying to tell Kalanick: “You’re raising the standards, and you’re dropping the prices.” Kalanick: “We’re not dropping the prices on black.” Kamel: “But in general the whole price is—” Kalanick: “We have to; we have competitors; otherwise, we’d go out of business.” Kamel: “Competitors? Man, you had the business model in your hands. You could have the prices you want, but you choose to buy everybody a ride.” Kalanick: “No, no no. You misunderstand me. We started high-end. We didn’t go low-end because we wanted to. We went low-end because we had to because we’d be out of business.” Kamel: “What? Lyft? It’s a piece of cake right there.” Kalanick: “It seems like a piece of cake because I’ve beaten them. But if I didn’t do the things I did, we would have been beaten, I promise.” The two bat that idea around, and Kamel brings the conversation back to his losses. Kamel: “But people are not trusting you anymore. … I lost $97,000 because of you. I'm bankrupt because of you. Yes, yes, yes. You keep changing every day. You keep changing every day.” Kalanick: “Hold on a second, what have I changed about Black? What have I changed?” Kamel: “You changed the whole business. You dropped the prices.” Kalanick: “On black?” Kamel: “Yes, you did.” Kalanick begins to lose his temper. “Bullshit,” he says. Kamel: “We started with $20.” Kalanick: “Bullshit.” Kamel: “We started with $20. How much is the mile now, $2.75?” Kalanick: “You know what?” Kamel: “What?” Kalanick: “Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own shit. They blame everything in their life on somebody else. Good luck!” Kamel: “Good luck to you, but I know [you're not] going to go far.” The door slams. Kamel drives away. Later, the Uber driver app prompts him to rate Kalanick, as he does all his riders. Kamel gives him one star.Drone startup Lily filed for bankruptcy as pre-order customers await their refunds: The Lily drone was supposed to ship by now, but the company shut down in January before ever delivering a single one of its hyped drones to any of the over 61,000 people who pre-ordered one. Following a lawsuit by the San Francisco District Attorney charging the company of misleading business practices, as well as a raid by federal agents, the now defunct drone company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Monday in Delaware. In 2015 and 2016, Lily had amassed $34.8 million in pre-sales for its drone and received $15 million in investment from some of Silicon Valley’s most high profile firms, including Spark Capital, SV Angel, High Line Venture Partners, Slow Ventures and Sherpa Capital. According to its bankruptcy filing, Lily plans to issue refunds and auction off its intellectual property. Though many pre-sale customers report having received their money back, dozens have emailed or called me in the past month complaining that they have yet to receive their refund despite repeated attempts to contact the company. “I have tried emailing the company multiple times with no response,” complained one pre-order customer last week. Lily was able to attract so many customers thanks to a highly produced video showcasing the product that went viral in 2015, but according to the lawsuit from the district attorney’s office, the footage that was supposed to be from the Lily drone in the promotional video wasn’t real. Rather it was captured with a “GoPro mounted to a Lily prototype,” wrote Lily CEO Antoine Balaresque in an email obtained by the district attorney. “I am worried that a lens geek could study our images up close and detect the unique GoPro lens footprint. But I am just speculating here: I don't know much about lenses but I think we should be extremely careful if we decide to lie publicly,” Balaresque wrote in another email to the producer of the video.Angry Birds-dependent games maker Rovio swings to annual profit: innish mobile games and animation studio Rovio Entertainment swung to an annual profit in 2016 as its Angry Birds movie release helped boost its game sales and tackle competition from new challengers such as Nintendo Co's Pokemon GO. However, analysts noted the private-held company must find new franchises and reduce its dependence on the Angry Birds brand to succeed in the highly competitive game industry. Following years of falling earnings, job cuts and divestments, Rovio's revenue increased 34 percent in 2016 to 190 million euros ($201 million). The operating result improved to a profit of 17.5 million euros from a loss of 21 million in 2015.Uber’s SVP of engineering is out after he did not disclose he left Google in a dispute over a sexual harassment allegation: Amit Singhal has left his job at Uber as its SVP of engineering because he did not disclose to the car-hailing company that he left Google a year earlier after top executives there informed him of an allegation of sexual harassment from an employee that an internal investigation had found “credible.” Singhal was asked to resign by Uber CEO Travis Kalanick this morning. Uber execs found out about the situation after Recode informed them of the chain of events between Singhal and the search giant this week. Indeed. According to multiple sources and internal notes read to me, after discussing the claims of an alleged encounter between Singhal and a female employee first with former Google HR head Laszlo Bock and also Google CEO Sundar Pichai in late 2015, he denied those claims at the time. He also apparently stated a number of times that there were two sides to every story. But, after the Christmas holidays, he then decided to resign himself after a 15-year career there. Sources said that Google was prepared to fire Singhal over the allegations after looking into the incident, but that it did not have to do so after he resigned.SpaceX Plans to Send 2 Tourists Around Moon in 2018: SpaceX, the ambitious rocket company headed by Elon Musk, wants to send a couple of tourists around the moon and back before the end of next year. If they manage that feat, they would be the first humans to venture that far into space in more than 40 years. Mr. Musk made the announcement on Monday in a telephone news conference. He said two private individuals approached the company to see if SpaceX would be willing to send them on a weeklong cruise, which would fly past the surface of the moon — but not land — and continue outward before Earth’s gravity turned the spacecraft around and brought it back for a landing. “This would do a long loop around the moon,” Mr. Musk said. The company is aiming to launch this moon mission in late 2018, he said. The two people would spend about a week inside one of SpaceX’s Dragon 2 capsules, launched on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket. The spacecraft would be automated, but the travelers would undergo training for emergencies, Mr. Musk said. He did not say how much the travelers would pay for the ride, but the Falcon Heavy itself has a list price of $90 million. He said the two would-be private space travelers wished to remain anonymous for now, and he declined to describe them except to say that they knew each other. In response to a reporter’s question, Mr. Musk did say the two were not Hollywood people.PebblePost raises $15M to combine online data and old-school mail: PebblePost is betting that there’s a big marketing opportunity in printed postcards and catalogs. The startup is announcing that it has raised $15 million in Series B funding. The round was led by RRE Ventures, with participation from Greycroft Partners and Tribeca Ventures. RRE’s Jim Robinson is joining the PebblePost board of directors. PebblePost describes its offering as “programmatic direct mail.” The idea is to send customized follow-ups to potential customers based on their online activity — so if you’re browsing a retailer’s website, you could get a postcard a few days later highlighting some of their products and maybe offering some discounts. CEO Lewis Gersh was previously a founder at seed investment firm Metamorphic Ventures (now known as Compound), where he said he built “probably the largest portfolio of retargeters of any fund in the country” — namely, companies that use your online behavior to target you for ads. (The ad companies he backed include iSocket, Mass Relevance and Movable Ink.) However, he said digital advertising has become “the new junk mail,” where marketers have to get more and more aggressive in the hopes of getting eyeballs and clicks. One of the problems, Gersh said, is that ads are often shown when someone is “100 percent not disposed to action — and worse.” In contrast, he said that when someone gets physical mail, they usually stick all the relevant stuff into a pile to deal with when they have more time. That means that when they actually go through their mail, they’re more likely to be receptive to a brand’s message — and maybe even ready to do some shopping. To be clear, you’re not necessarily going to get a postcard talking about the exact product you were looking at — Gersh acknowledged that would be “annoying” and “spooky.” Instead, you might see other products that are in the same category, serving as a “gentle, relevant reminder.” The approach seems to be working, with an average of 7 to 10 percent of PebblePost mail resulting in a purchase.Ola raises $330 mn at $3.5-bn valuation: Ola, India’s largest taxi aggregator, has raised $330 million in fresh funding, at a valuation of about $3.5 billion, from Japanese investor SoftBank and two other existing ones. The round saw Ola’s valuation dropping 30 per cent from a peak of $5 billion, as global rival Uber significantly stepped up its challenge to the Indian firm.Google and Uber Are Fighting Over Lidar Technology. What Is It? Lidar is a radar-like system that uses lasers instead of radio waves to build a 3-D image of the surrounding landscape. Since satellite navigation systems are only accurate to within 16 feet and can be easily flummoxed by high-rise and glass-fronted buildings, autonomous vehicles require an array of other sensors to position themselves precisely and maintain awareness of nearby pedestrians, vehicles and other objects. Lidar comprises a series of rotating, stacked lasers that shoot out at different angles. Each layer is called a channel, and is made up of two laser beams. The signal from each individual channel creates one contour line, and together, those lines generate a 3-D image of the surrounding environment. That means that, the more lasers in each stack, the higher the resolution. Velodyne, for instance, manufactures products with 16, 32 and 64 laser channels. The main hurdle to lidar becoming a widely adopted technology in mass-produced cars is cost. A 64-channel unit from Velodyne can cost more than $50,000, while the lower end 16-channel product sells for $7,999. Since a car might require several lidar units, it quickly makes the cost prohibitive for anything but the most expensive luxury cars. Velodyne and competitors such as Quanergy Systems Inc. are working to reduce the price. That would be accelerated by major orders for mass market cars.Alphabet’s Waymo is suing Otto and Uber for allegedly stealing the design of a key self-driving system: Waymo, formerly Google’s self-driving car unit, is suing Otto — the self-driving trucking company co-founded by former Waymo employee Anthony Levandowski and quickly acquired by Uber — for allegedly stealing the company’s proprietary design for its laser-based radar system. According to Waymo, before Levandowski left what was then a part of Google’s moonshot labs, he downloaded 14,000 “highly confidential” files to an external hard drive, including the design for the company’s lidar circuit board. The company decided to perform a forensic investigation of Levandowski’s former company computer after a Waymo employee was inadvertently copied on an email from a lidar supplier with the subject line “Otto Files.” The email was being sent to a list of people that Waymo believes were Uber employees. Attached to the email were drawings of Otto’s lidar circuit board. It looked just like Waymo’s design, the company alleged in the suit filed today, “the design of which had been downloaded by Mr. Levandowski before his resignation.” “The Replicated Board reflects Waymo’s highly confidential proprietary LiDAR technology and Waymo trade secrets,” the complaint reads. “Moreover, the Replicated Board is specifically designed to be used in conjunction with many other Waymo trade secrets and in the context of overall LiDAR systems covered by Waymo patents.” To then verify its suspicions, Waymo filed a public records request to the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development and Department of Motor Vehicles in February for Otto’s communications with the departments. In that correspondence, Otto indicated that the company was using custom lidar that it built in-house. Waymo cites this as evidence that Uber and Otto are using a circuit board that “bears a striking resemblance” to Waymo’s. Lidars are seen by most as a crucial piece of self-driving technology. The radar shoots lasers at objects in order to detect them and works closely with the cameras and normal radars to create a thorough image of the car’s surroundings.Thistle launches meal kits to make nutritious baby food at home: Food delivery startup Thistle was never in the business of making meal kits, those boxes of pre-measured ingredients and recipes to help customers cook at home. The startup’s married cofounders, Ashwin Cheriyan and Shiri Avnery, thought that prepared meals, ready-to-heat or raw and ready-to-eat, were a better fit for their busy customers. Meal kits, they said, felt like time consuming and frustrating cooking lessons when they tried them personally. The Thistle Baby meal kit consists of vacuum-sealed bags of apportioned, organic ingredients, flash-frozen to preserve flavor. A parent would open up the pouch, and steam and puree it however they like, then add spices also provided in the meal kit at levels they or their kids like best. The company says its prices work out to $2 per toddler or infant meal. Before now, the startup was trialing its Thistle Baby service with an invitation-only group of subscribers. As of next week, Thistle Baby will become available to any customers who sign up for it.Snapchat Founders’ Grip Tightened After a Spat With an Early Investor: One of the biggest questions that Snap has faced from potential investors is why its two founders, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, have retained such a hold on voting power in the company — power that public shareholders will not gain. Exploring that question helps explain how years-ago dealings with venture capitalists helped lead to this point. At the heart of that is a Lightspeed venture capitalist, Jeremy Liew, and the terms he embedded in his 2012 investment in what was then known as Snapchat. The terms gave Mr. Liew outsize power over the company’s future financing round. That ended up irking Snapchat’s chief executive, Mr. Spiegel, who took steps to reassert control over the company.The end result was a largely severed connection. Today, Lightspeed is listed in Snap’s I.P.O. prospectus as the company’s second biggest venture investor, with 86.6 million shares, or a stake of more than 8 percent, and Mr. Liew has appeared on television shows, podcasts and in technology publications to discuss Snap. Yet he and Snap no longer have close ties, and Mr. Spiegel has not had meetings or hung out with Mr. Liew since the early investment rounds.Mr. Liew and Mr. Spiegel met in March 2012, when Mr. Liew used Facebook to contact Mr. Spiegel, a Stanford University student who had recently started Snapchat with Mr. Murphy, a fraternity brother. At the meeting that followed, Mr. Spiegel said his father was tired of paying Snapchat’s bills. Mr. Liew offered to help. Mr. Liew offered to invest $485,000 in Snapchat, which Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy accepted. The investment was completed in less than two weeks. What Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy paid less attention to were the exact terms that Mr. Liew embedded in the deal. Those terms gave Lightspeed the right of first refusal to invest in a future round of funding and the ability to increase its share of the company that round. Lightspeed could also take 50 percent of the future round. Such terms effectively let Lightspeed have veto power over the next investment at Snap. It also made Snap an unattractive investment for other investors — who would not be able to take as large a stake as they would like in the company.Mr. Spiegel was unhappy with the outcome. Over the years, he has alluded to his early dissatisfaction with venture investors. In a 2015 interview at a start-up awards show, he said, “when we were first getting started and took financing, our lawyers would take us through the documents and they’d say, ‘Oh, don’t worry about it. It’s all standard.’” “I’ve since learned that standard means either the person who’s walking you through documents doesn’t understand them or you could be getting taken advantage of,” Mr. Spiegel continued. “When someone says something is standard, just ask why, and why and why and why, until you really understand intricately, I think, how the deal is structured.”Snapdeal orders mass lay-off: Once a success story of the burgeoning start-up ecosystem, Gurgaon-based online marketplace Snapdeal on Wednesday said it would cut more jobs, stop paying its founders and sell its digital wallet FreeCharge.  Co-founder Kunal Bahl, in an email to employees on Wednesday, finally accepted tough decisions— including letting go of people and a full pay cut for him— are being taken. It has also put on sale FreeCharge and is in talks with Naspers, the South Africa-based internet group, to sell it for $300 million. Though the company refused to divulge the exact number of people to be sacked, sources close to the development said 800 employees would be laid off over the next few days. Sources confirmed 100 were asked to go on the day itself, within a few minutes of Bahl’s email. “By the time we finished reading the mail, HR (human resource) called us to their office. They said we would get three months of severance pay. We said yes, as that was the only option on the table,” said an employee who was sacked on Wednesday. According to sources, employees from marketing, ad-tech, category, digital marketing, engineering team, catalogues, have all been asked to leave. Bahl and his co-founder Rohit Bansal said they will not take pay henceforth. Job cuts at the beleaguered start-up continued, as it struggled to raise fresh funds and compete against larger rivals such as Flipkart and Amazon. SoftBank-backed Snapdeal would have 1,300 people left on its rolls after the current round of retrenchment— a cut of 87 per cent since its peak of 10,000 in February 2016.Inside Uber’s Aggressive, Unrestrained Workplace Culture: Interviews with more than 30 current and former Uber employees, as well as reviews of internal emails, chat logs and tape-recorded meetings, paint a picture of an often unrestrained workplace culture. Among the most egregious accusations from employees, who either witnessed or were subject to incidents and who asked to remain anonymous because of confidentiality agreements and fear of retaliation: One Uber manager groped female co-workers’ breasts at a company retreat in Las Vegas. A director shouted a homophobic slur at a subordinate during a heated confrontation in a meeting. Another manager threatened to beat an underperforming employee’s head in with a baseball bat.New details emerge about Palantir’s custom software for spy agencies: A new report by The Intercept provides some compelling specifics on collaboration between Palo Alto’s secretive big data shop Palantir and the intelligence agencies that it keeps on its client roster. While some broad strokes are known about Palantir’s relationship with spy agencies, the finer points seldom see daylight. That guarantee of secrecy no doubt aids the company’s growth into 2017, though its cozy relationship with a presidency keen on implementing aggressive policies with big opportunities for big data certainly can’t hurt, either. The report goes into more detail on the development of two particular software systems, one called Kite and one known as XKEYSCORE Helper. Through Kite, implemented by GCHQ, Palantir offered deep customization: “Out of the box, Kite was able to handle a variety of types of data (including dates, images, geolocations, etc.), but GCHQ was free to extend it by writing custom fields for complicated types of data the agency might need to analyze. The import tools were designed to handle a variety of use cases, including static data sets, databases that were updated frequently, and data stores controlled by third parties to which GCHQ was able to gain access.” Designed in apparent collaboration with Palantir, XKEYSCORE Helper sought to make data obtained through the NSA’s muscular XKEYSCORE program more digestible and offered a way to port it into Palantir’s more analyst-friendly interface: “This collaborative environment also produced a piece of software called “XKEYSCORE Helper,” a tool programmed with Palantir (and thoroughly stamped with its logo) that allowed analysts to essentially import data from the NSA’s pipeline, investigate and visualize it through Palantir, and then presumably pass it to fellow analysts or Five Eyes intelligence partners.”Rakuten Surges on Share Buyback at Half the Price of 2015 Issue: Rakuten Inc. surged the most in more than a decade after the Japanese e-commerce operator announced plans to buy back as much as 100 billion yen ($881 million) of stock at a significant discount to a share issue just 20 months ago. Shares climbed 11 percent to 1,149 yen in early Tokyo trade, headed for the biggest gain since 2004. Before today, the stock had fallen 46 percent since the 2015 issue. Back then, Rakuten sold almost 100 million shares for 1,905.5 yen apiece, raising about 181 billion yen. The stock closed on Tuesday at 1,032.5 yen, a drop of 46 percent over the period. Like other Japanese companies sitting on a comfortable cash pile, Rakuten has enough on its balance sheet to fund the repurchase: 548 billion yen as of end-December. The buyback was prompted as shares were undervalued, Mikitani told the Nikkei newspaper in an interview. He said he there’s a big discrepancy between the current stock price and how Rakuten sees its corporate value. Rakuten has increasingly positioned itself as a provider of financial services in Japan, in addition to its online marketplace. It also owns the Viber messaging application, which is ranked seventh behind WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Tencent’s QQ, according to Statista.Uber Investigating Sexual Harassment Claims by Ex-Employee: The chief executive of Uber on Sunday opened an internal investigation into claims of sexual harassment made by a former engineer at the company. The engineer, Susan Fowler, said that she was sexually harassed by her direct supervisor during her time at Uber and that after she reported those claims to the human resources department, they were ignored. She gave her account in a lengthy post on her personal blog on Sunday. “It was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him, and it was so clearly out of line that I immediately took screenshots of these chat messages and reported him to HR,” Ms. Fowler wrote. “Upper management told me that he ‘was a high performer’ (i.e. had stellar performance reviews from his superiors) and they wouldn’t feel comfortable punishing him for what was probably just an innocent mistake on his part.” Ms. Fowler left Uber in December and this year joined Stripe, a payments processing start-up. Ms. Fowler’s story is particularly resonant because of Uber’s reputation for having an intense workplace culture with high turnover. Hours after Ms. Fowler’s post, Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, said it was the first time the issue had come to his attention. He said he had instructed Liane Hornsey, the company’s recently hired chief of human resources, “to conduct an urgent investigation into these allegations.”Texas Oil Fields Rebound From Price Lull, but Jobs Are Left Behind: Oil and gas workers have traditionally had some of the highest-paying blue-collar jobs — just the type that President Trump has vowed to preserve and bring back. But the West Texas oil fields, where activity is gearing back up as prices rebound, illustrate how difficult it will be to meet that goal. As in other industries, automation is creating a new demand for high-tech workers — sometimes hundreds of miles away in a control center — but their numbers don’t offset the ranks of field hands no longer required to sling chains and lift iron. Roughly 163,000 oil jobs were lost nationally from the 2014 peak, or about 30 percent of the total, while oil prices plummeted, at one point by as much as 70 percent. The job losses just in Texas, the most productive oil-producing state, totaled 98,000. Several thousand workers have come back to work in recent months as the price of oil has begun to rise again, but energy experts say that between a third and a half of the workers who lost their jobs are not returning. Many have migrated to construction or even jobs in renewable energy, like wind power. “People have left the industry, and they are not coming back,” said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a Pennsylvania manufacturer of drilling rigs. “If it’s a repetitive task, it can be automated, and I don’t need someone to do that. I can get a computer to do that.” Indeed, computers now direct drill bits that were once directed manually. The wireless technology taking hold across the oil patch allows a handful of geoscientists and engineers to monitor the drilling and completion of multiple wells at a time — onshore or miles out to sea — and supervise immediate fixes when something goes wrong, all without leaving their desks. It is a world where rigs walk on their own legs and sensors on wells alert headquarters to a leak or loss of pressure, reducing the need for a technician to check. And despite all the lost workers, United States oil production is galloping upward, to nine million barrels a day from 8.6 million in September. Nationwide, with a bit more than one-third as many rigs operating as in 2014, production is not even down 10 percent from record levels.Snap arrives in London to woo skeptical investors ahead of IPO: Snap Inc, owner of popular messaging app Snapchat, kicked off its first investor roadshow on Monday, looking to persuade London money managers to back its initial public offering in the face of concerns about its growth prospects, valuation and corporate governance. The U.S. company, which has yet to make a profit, is targeting a valuation of between $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion from listing on the New York Stock Exchange, after cutting its initial target of $20 billion-$25 billion last week following investor feedback. Investors attending Monday's event said Snap's 26-year-old Chief Executive Evan Spiegel gave a sleek presentation. However, they were disappointed there were no projections on the company's future revenues or advertising share - an indication of how quickly Snap thinks it can make money from its huge user base. \"That's the million dollar question and we won't find out for some time,\" said one potential backer on his way out from the hour-long event where Spiegel ditched his usual casual wear and wore a suit with no tie. Few U.S. firms aside from Apple have made big profits on hardware, and camera and wearable gadget makers have much lower valuations than Snap is seeking. Most of the questions related to how the company plans to manage its engagement with advertisers and users, and monetize that better, according to people who were in the room. Its responses won over some potential investors. \"Management did a good show, they were very convincing,\" said one attendee. Some fund managers have said they will stay away from Snap given its decision to adopt a three class share structure - the first of its kind - that will mean shareholders who buy in through the IPO will not have any voting rights. Instead Spiegel and his co-founder Bobby Murphy will have the right to 10 votes for every share, and existing investors one vote for each of their shares. \"My view would be investors should tread with caution here, the fact the shares will carry no voting rights would be a major concern for me from a governance perspective,\" Richard Saldanha, global equities fund manager at Aviva Investors, said ahead of the roadshow. Aviva manages 318 billion pounds across a range of asset classes. Mike Fox, head of sustainable investments at Royal London Asset Management, said the inability to vote against a company at its annual general meeting was a \"major red flag\" and he would not be taking part in the IPO.These University of Washington professors are teaching a course on bullshit: Two University of Washington professors are teaching a course to help students “think critically about the data and models that constitute evidence in the social and natural sciences,” according to the introduction to the course. The 160-seat seminar, titled “Calling Bullshit in the Age of Big Data,” begins in late March and continues for roughly 10 weeks. Members of the general public can follow the course syllabus, including readings and recordings of lectures, at the course’s website. At the end of the course, students should be able to “provide your crystals-and-homeopathy aunt or casually racist uncle with an accessible and persuasive explanation of why a claim is bullshit,” according to the syllabus. One area of big problems: Big Data (one of the buzzwords of the century, which at its simplest refers to big sets of data, but has likely also been overhyped in its potential for revolution). He said he noticed methods of statistics meant for smaller data sets being applied to “big” data sets with millions or billions of examples, where it’s easy to force a correlation that isn’t necessarily accurate. He also observed situations where machine-learning algorithms were “overfitting” data. Basically, you can have an algorithm that so specifically matches a particular data set, meaning it reflects even errors or noise, it fails when applied to another data set where you would otherwise expect it to work. You would normally want an algorithm that is sufficiently general to fit more than one data set. The syllabus went viral after it was posted last month, according to a Friday story in Stat News — the instructors’ email inboxes were overflowing, and some book offers were even made. The course reportedly filled all open seats within the first minute of online registration at UW.Expedia and Amazon Double Down on Britain: As politicians and businesses wrestle with potential changes to U.K. border controls, one of the world’s largest online travel booking companies has decided to add hundreds of new staff in London, and it’s not alone in looking to expand. Expedia Inc. will expand its U.K. office by 138,000 square feet, or to roughly twice the size of its existing space, and has signed a new lease that runs until 2030, according to a company statement. The company currently has about 1,400 staff at its London hub. Amazon.com Inc. is also hiring for its U.K.-based voice-recognition technology, cloud computing centers and Prime Air division, it said in a statement. The moves come as the U.K technology industry frets about the fallout from the nation’s decision to leave the European Union by 2019, even as global tech companies continue to consider London the region’s major hub. Snap lowers valuation expectations in highly awaited IPO: Snap Inc, owner of the popular messaging app Snapchat, set a lower-than-expected valuation range on Thursday, amid mounting investor concern over its unproven business model, slowing growth and tight founder control. The company, which filed for an initial public offering earlier this month, was widely expected to be valued at between $20 billion and $25 billion. However it said on Thursday it was targeting a valuation between $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion, ahead of an investor roadshow due to start on Monday in London. The lower valuation range reflected initial investor feedback. Snap wants to ensure there is sufficient demand for shares of the company that it trades up on its first day in public market. Investors have been poring over the filing for Snap's upcoming IPO to assess whether the still-unprofitable company will be the next Facebook, which has figured out how to make money from its social media platform, or if it will be more like Twitter, which is struggling to achieve the same goal.Apple Vowed to Revolutionize Television. An Inside Look at Why It Hasn’t: Apple has essentially settled for turning the television set into a giant iPhone: a cluster of apps with a store. \"That's not what I signed up for,\" says one of the people, who requested anonymity to talk freely about internal company matters. \"I signed up for revolutionary. We got evolutionary.\" Gene Munster, who covered Apple for more than a decade as a Piper Jaffray analyst and now runs Loup Ventures, echoes the criticism. \"Apple TV begs the question: Why does Apple do hobbies?\" he says. \"Either do it right or don't do it at all.\"The Apple TV's history is a study in gradualism. Previewed by Steve Jobs in 2006, the first box was designed simply to stream iTunes video from a Mac to a TV set. The next version, launched in the fall of 2010, let users stream content from the internet. The latest box was announced in September 2015, a few months later than originally scheduled. Widely considered an improvement by consumers and product reviewers, the Apple TV features the App Store, voice control and a glass remote that enables motion-controlled gaming, which for example lets players use the remote like a steering wheel for a car-racing title.  But the latest Apple TV sells for $149, more than twice as much as its predecessor, $60 more than Amazon's Fire TV and $20 more than the priciest Roku. What's more, little about the viewing experience has changed. Apple TV users still have to buy an individual episode via the iTunes Store, pay extra for services like Hulu, or download an app tied to a particular channel and log in with an existing cable subscription. The Apple TV's software is also less ambitious than originally envisioned. The current model features an iPhone-like app grid, but designers had prototyped more novel interfaces. One idea, dubbed \"Intentions\" internally, put the four tabs in the center of the screen: three for the Apple TV's main content types (video, music, and gaming) and one for everything else. Another idea: letting viewers pull up previews of content by hovering on each icon (a feature currently reserved for apps in the top row). To a certain extent, the Apple TV is handcuffed by its parent's addiction to fat margins. Apple is constitutionally allergic to losing money on a product—even if it can make up the difference by selling content.Snapdeal’s cash squeeze adds to funding pressure: Jasper Infotech which runs Snapdeal, had about Rs1,100-1,200 crore cash left in the bank and Rs300-400 crore at its payments unit Freecharge at the end of 2016, making it critical for the company to secure funds immediately, according to official documents and three people familiar with the matter. Snapdeal has gone into cash-conserve mode after talks for a bridge round of funding with existing investor SoftBank were deferred because of differences over valuation, the three people cited above said. Snapdeal is still in talks with at least two other existing investors, the people said, declining to be identified. Snapdeal’s dwindling cash reserves crimp its ability to compete with rivals Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm and also raise questions about how long it can survive without fresh capital.Uber Gives Restless Employees a Way to Cash Out: Many longtime employees of Uber Technologies Inc. are multi-millionaires, at least on paper. But with no initial public offering in sight and a strict policy blocking most private share sales, they’re stuck in limbo. However, there’s a little-known option available to Uber loyalists looking to cash out. Those who work at the San Francisco company for at least four years can sell as much as 10 percent of their shares, people familiar with the matter said. The program has a built-in incentive to entice staff to stick around. The seller gets paid out over many months and must remain at Uber during that time, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to discuss the program publicly. The formal plan, which has been in effect for a couple years but was previously unreported, caps buybacks at well below $10 million per employee, one of the people said. Fewer than 200 of the some 10,000 people employed by Uber currently qualify for the program, the person said. Although well-compensated by any rational standard, startup employees often take pay cuts compared with what they could receive at Facebook Inc. or Google. They join knowing a chunk of their pay is tied to the fortunes of their employer and could become worthless. What many workers hadn’t bargained for was how long they’d have to wait to find out what would happen. Airbnb Inc. and Pinterest Inc. were founded around the same time as Uber, achieved valuations in excess of $10 billion and yet remain private. But the two companies have at times allowed their employees to sell shares to interested buyers and even facilitated some of those transactions. Uber, the world’s most valuable tech startup at $69 billion, has been more restrictive about who gets to buy its shares.Dubai is planning to launch autonomous, one-passenger drone taxis this summer: Pilotless drones capable of carrying a person will begin to soar through Dubai’s airspace this July, according to an announcement made Monday by Mattar Al Tayer, the chief of Dubai’s Roads & Transportation Agency, at the World Government Summit. The country is turning to a Chinese-made drone, the Ehang 184, which can carry a passenger weighing up to 220 pounds for about a 30-minute trip. The egg-shaped aircraft hovers using eight propellers — two attached to each of the drone’s four arms. Test flights have already been conducted in Dubai, and the taxi service is expected to launch in July, says Al Tayer.Verizon close to Yahoo deal, price cut of $250-350 million: sources: Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) is close to a revised deal to buy Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) core internet business for $250 million to $350 million less than the original agreed price of $4.83 billion, according to a source briefed on the matter. Since last year, Verizon had been trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from two cyber attacks. A source told Reuters that the deal, which could come as soon as this week, will entail Verizon and Yahoo sharing the liability from potential lawsuits related to the data breaches.How Ben Thompson built Stratechery into a one-man publishing empire: Ben Thompson has established himself as one of the smartest analysts and clearest thinkers on the media and technology industries. And he has built an interesting, rather unique business, self-publishing his Stratechery blog and subscription-based email newsletter from Taiwan, where he lives. “I felt I had insight to offer that people would find valuable,” Thompson told Recode Senior Editor Peter Kafka, by focusing on writing about technology and business strategy and not just products. Thompson was working at Microsoft when he started the publication in 2013, and launched his subscription business — currently $10 per month, or $100 per year — in 2014. “The internet enables niche in a massively powerful way, where you can focus and be really good at one thing,” Thompson said. “And because you’re not constrained to a geographic area, you can reach the entire world. I have subscribers in 30 countries.” How many subscribers? “A lot.” Kafka asked: What about joining up with a venture capital firm and collecting a big paycheck as a “public intellectual” as others have done — a group that includes famous dot-com-era analyst Mary Meeker, who’s now at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Benedict Evans, who built a following on Twitter and now works at Andreessen Horowitz. “That seems like a better life than having to schlep $10 subscriptions.” “People underestimate the scale of the internet,” Thompson said. “Certainly I work hard, but the amount of work I’m doing today is the exact same amount of work I was doing three years ago. The only difference is my income is 100 times higher. And it’s because that $10 scales, and it scales very, very well.” “And I’m glad those VC guys are interested, but they’re also all subscribers — I can assure you of that.”SoftBank of Japan Will Buy U.S. Private Equity Giant Fortress: Over its three-decade existence, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and its founder, Masayoshi Son, have been known for ambitious and sometimes head-scratching moves. Now, SoftBank is nearing its most unusual move yet: It is buying Fortress Investment Group, an American private equity giant that oversees around $70 billion in assets. That business is a radical departure from the technology and telecommunications holdings for which the Japanese company is known. But the acquisition is intended to energize SoftBank’s other enormous new endeavor: a $100 billion technology investment fund that threatens to roil the private equity world. The move highlights the immense ambitions of SoftBank’s brash founder, Mr. Son. The 59-year-old mogul, who is one of Japan’s richest men, has sought to shake up the American telecommunications industry and recently sought to win over President Trump by announcing intentions to create jobs in the United States. SoftBank will be paying $3.3 billion for Fortress, a premium to the company’s stock market value of $2.3 billion. As part of the agreement, SoftBank has the option of bringing in partners to help cover the cost of the deal and who may want to become investors in Fortress funds, too, thus increasing assets under management. The deal frees up Peter L. Briger Jr. and Wesley R. Edens of Fortress to focus on their strengths as fund managers — several of their private equity funds have produced double-digit returns over time — without having to deal with the headaches of running a public company. As leaders of a public company, they struggled mightily to bolster their stock, more so than their competitors. Recently, the firm shut down its flagship hedge fund.Airbnb Wants to Spend Some of the $3 Billion It’s Sitting On: Airbnb Inc. is on a mission to be more than a home-sharing platform. It wants to be a flight booker, an itinerary planner and a vacation-home manager. To become a global travel behemoth, Airbnb is considering a combination of acquisitions and partnership deals to quickly grow its portfolio, according to three people with knowledge of Airbnb's plans. The company's targets are in luxury tourism, airfare aggregation, group payments and guest-management, said the people, who asked not to be identified because Airbnb hasn't authorized them to speak publicly. Airbnb is also focused on doing deals in China and India, the people said. On Thursday, Bloomberg reported that Airbnb's board met to approve the purchase of Luxury Retreats, a vacation-home management company in Montreal. The sale is expected to garner no more than $300 million in cash and stock. Airbnb is also in the process of purchasing the group-payments company Tilt. Airbnb declined to comment on the deals because they are not yet public.  New product categories would generate alternative revenue sources for Airbnb. Over the last few years, after pressure from regulators, Airbnb agreed to place limits on how long hosts can rent their homes to travelers in certain cities. Officials in London, New York, Amsterdam, San Francisco and Barcelona have claimed Airbnb’s short-term rentals violate local zoning laws and displace long-term residents. The policymakers continue to seek laws that could place considerable restrictions on Airbnb’s money-making ability. Airbnb became profitable in the second half of 2016, when revenue at the company increased more than 80 percent that year, Bloomberg reported. Airbnb expects to remain profitable in 2017.SoundCloud loses key executives amid fundraising drive: Music-streaming service SoundCloud has lost two senior executives and is seeking to raise new funding, the company said on Sunday, but denied a Financial Times report that it was running low on cash. Marc Strigel, SoundCloud's chief operating officer, and finance director Markus Harder left after five years with the company to pursue new opportunities, a spokeswoman for Berlin-based SoundCloud said, without giving details. \"SoundCloud is currently fundraising, which is typical of most startups of our size and in our phase of growth,\" the spokeswoman said, denying an assertion by an anonymous source quoted by the FT as saying it was seeking financing in \"desperation.\" The firm raised $100 million last June from a group of investors including Twitter, half the $193 million it has taken in since its founding in 2008, according to Crunchbase data. The FT's source said SoundCloud was looking to raise funds while seeking to avoid accepting a lower valuation than the roughly $700 million when it last raised money. SoundCloud is popular among music artists, but has been less successful at striking licensing deals on favorable terms with major music labels than rivals Spotify and Apple Music. The SoundCloud spokeswoman reported business as usual, saying the executive departures were unrelated to its fundraising. The company said in a report filed early in January that it made a loss of 48.7 million euros ($51.8 million) after tax during the 2015 calendar year.Infosys Founders Said to Question Payments for CEO, Managers: The board of Infosys Ltd., India’s second-largest technology services company, is facing questions over executive compensation and corporate governance in a letter sent by at least three of its founders, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Narayana Murthy, Nandan Nilekani and Kris Gopalakrishnan have signed the document asking why Chief Executive Officer Vishal Sikka’s compensation was increased, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified discussing the contents of a private memo. Sikka was paid 487 million rupees ($7.3 million) in base salary, bonus and benefits last year, compared with a base salary of 45.6 million rupees for a partial period in 2015. The letter also questioned severance packages offered to two top-level executives who departed the company. Infosys shares listed in New York rose 3.3 percent to close at $14.57, the highest in a month. The stock declined 11 percent in 2016. Infosys’s revenue is projected to climb 10 percent in the current fiscal year, compared with 17 percent prior, as clients cut back on spending. Cloud-computing and automation of information-technology tasks are disrupting Infosys’s business model of charging man hours for application development, infrastructure maintenance and other work that keeps corporate computer systems and networks up and running. “Infosys is behaving in a much more non-transparent manner than in the past,” said Shriram Subramanian, managing director of corporate governance researcher InGovern. “At the same time, Infosys’ co-founders seem unable to cut off their umbilical cord with the company.”Zenefits Cuts 45% of Staff as New CEO Pushes Changes: Zenefits announced it will cut 45 percent of its workforce as new Chief Executive Officer Jay Fulcher reduces costs in the wake of regulatory scrutiny and management shakeups that collapsed the company’s expansion plans.The 430 job cuts announced Thursday are the third round of staff reductions for the human resources software maker in the past year amid investigations that found some employees used software to skirt training requirements and sold health insurance without the necessary licenses. Zenefits agreed in November to pay as much as $7 million to the state of California over licensing violations. Thursday’s staff cuts are companywide and affect all departments, Zenefits said. The job reductions were reported earlier by BuzzFeed. The closely held San Francisco-based company hired too many employees in 2015 to sustain its revenue projections, Fulcher said in a memo to the staff.Intel uses White House Oval Office for splash on Arizona factory: Intel Corp chose the White House Oval Office as its backdrop to announce a $7 billion investment in a previously shelved Arizona factory, which it said would create 3,000 jobs when it is up and running. Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich told reporters about the investment while standing behind President Donald Trump. Trump told reporters Krzanich called him a few weeks ago to say he wanted to meet to make a big announcement. Krzanich said he made the announcement at the White House as a sign of support for the \"tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward.\"Siemens completes key test of 3D-printed gas-turbine blades: German engineering group Siemens has run a successful test of power generation gas turbine blades produced wholly by metal-based 3D printing by UK-based Materials Solutions, which it bought last year. Siemens said on Monday it was the first to test such blades under full-load engine conditions at 13,000 revolutions per minutes and temperatures above 1,250 Celsius (2,282 Fahrenheit). It called the test a \"breakthrough\". 3D printing, also called additive manufacturing, involves making a three-dimensional object by adding ultra-thin layers of material one by one, following a digital design, in contrast to conventional manufacturing, where excess material is cut away. Siemens' U.S. rival General Electric bought two 3D printing firms last year for over $1 billion and introduced its first 3D-printed aircraft engine component into service last July. The blades in the Siemens test were made from a powder of high-performing polycrystalline nickel superalloy. The 3D technology made possible a new design with improved internal cooling geometry.WeChat users send 46 billion digital red packets over Lunar New Year: Xinhua:Users of WeChat sent around 46 billion electronic red packets - digital versions of traditional envelopes stuffed with cash - via the Chinese mobile social platform over the Lunar New Year period, the official Xinhua new agency reported on Saturday. China has a long tradition of giving red packets during the Lunar New Year, which fell on Jan. 28 this year. Internet giants such as Alibaba Group Holding have promoted the use of virtual red packets, also known as \"hongbaos\", to grow business in the country's booming mobile payment market. The number of digital red packets sent via WeChat, owned by Alibaba rival Tencent Holdings Ltd, rose 43 percent in the Jan. 27 and Feb. 1 period compared with a year earlier, according to Xinhua. People in the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong and Hebei led the red packets mania, while South Koreans were WeChat's most active hongbao senders outside the Chinese mainland, Xinhua said.Financing growth with debt in the app economy: Smart developers consider accounts receivable (AR) financing or venture debt as suitable sources of financing because they are generally low cost and don’t dilute their equity. However, many often don’t read the “fine print,” which can lead to them signing away more than they need to. So how can you avoid this increasingly common pitfall?One of the keys to making the right financing choice is understanding the concept of liquidation preferences. When lending money, banks or venture debt providers will require you to pledge certain assets as security against the funds advanced. This is known in the U.S. as a lien (or a charge in the U.K.). Liquidation preference determines which creditors are paid out first if your company ends up in financial difficulties and goes into receivership.The assets you pledge as security should be appropriate for how you’re going to use the money you borrow. For example, if you’re borrowing money against your receivables to fund growth, you should only secure the loan against your receivables. Generally speaking, if an asset can be clearly defined, there’s no reason other assets should be included as security, although lenders will often try to include wider coverage as it improves their overall security position in the event of any default. Here’s an analogy: When you take out a mortgage to buy a home, you must pledge your home as security for the loan. But the bank doesn’t ask you to also pledge other assets like your vehicles or your future earning capacity (in other words, your personal intellectual property).Snap shoots for the sky, promises little in $3 billion IPO pitch: Snapchat owner Snap Inc shot the opening salvo in its $3 billion initial public offering on Thursday, outlining aggressive expansion plans but offering new investors no say on how the company is run and no promise of profits. Snap's publication on Thursday of its IPO registration document sets the stage for its upcoming marketing campaign to convince investors to look past its widening losses and the firm grip of its founders, and focus on its rapid growth of active users. The number of Snap's daily active users grew to an average of 158 million at the end of December, up 48 percent year-on-year, Snap revealed. However, its net loss widened to $514.6 million in 2016 from $372.9 million the year before. While Snap will have time to polish its marketing pitch in the run-up to the IPO planned for March, some analysts were taken aback that the company was just beginning to reap cash from its product. \"What surprises me the most is that it is still very early days when it comes to Snap making money,\" said Rohit Kulkarni, managing director at private securities investment firm SharesPost.Snap had $404.5 million in sales in 2016, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, it had adjusted losses before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year of $459 million, compared with $292.9 million in 2015. Snap's biggest losses stem from \"hosting fees\" which it pays to cloud computing companies such as Google to use their infrastructure for its data. It will pay Google $2 billion over the next five years to use its cloud computing services. Because Snapchat users rely heavily on data-heavy pictures and video, the cost of these service is high. Still, the proportion of the company's costs to its revenue has been declining. Its strategy has been to bargain for better hosting rates as its growing number of users buoys its negotiating leverage. \"They are adding infrastructure ahead of growth, and that is why you have some front-loading of losses,\" said SharesPost's Kulkarni.Facebook Loses $500 Million Virtual Reality Headset Verdict: The virtual reality headset maker that Facebook Inc. bought in 2014 for $2 billion used stolen computer code, a jury said in awarding $500 million to ZeniMax Media Inc. The case was over the Oculus Rift, the device that has put the social media giant at the forefront of the virtual reality boom. Wednesday’s verdict in Dallas federal court is a rebuke to Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, who isn’t a defendant but who told jurors in his first-ever courtroom testimony that it was important for him to be there because the claims by ZeniMax were “false.” An Oculus spokeswoman said the company will appeal. The case centered around the defection of video-game programmer John Carmack from ZeniMax, where he had designed blockbuster games Doom and Quake, to Oculus, where he was named chief technology officer in 2013. He acknowledged in testimony that he took with him e-mail records including computer code related to virtual reality.H&R Block is now using IBM Watson to find tax deductions: Getting your taxes done is miserable. It’s complicated, time-consuming and costly — particularly for people whose financial situation requires them to seek help from tax professionals. The process is such a mess, even for said professionals, that H&R Block, one of the largest tax services providers, is partnering with IBM Watson to help make the process go more smoothly. Yes, that’s right — we now need machine intelligence to save us from our taxes. Watson will use natural language processing to parse tax documents and relate statements back to the 74,000-page federal tax code. It’s not hard to see how a machine would excel at this clearly defined search task. These are just the sorts of problems that machines tend to outperform humans in solving. There are a number of things that could be automated in the tax preparation process, but H&R Block decided to focus on identifying deductions and credits. The consumer-facing approach will do the firm well. At the end of the day, most people really only care about paying as little in taxes as possible and maximizing the size of their refund. Using tax documents as a corpus for training Watson, IBM was able to fine-tune its system for H&R Block. Because Watson is constantly receiving more tax documents year in and year out, it will improve over time. H&R Block will benefit from a more accurate artificial companion each new tax season. This is on top of any changes IBM makes to the core Watson infrastructure.Trump’s Next Immigration Move to Hit Closer to Home for Tech: After the new president banned refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Microsoft and others railed against the move, saying it violated the country’s principles and risked disrupting its engine of innovation. Trump’s next steps could strike even closer to home: His administration has drafted an executive order aimed at overhauling the work-visa programs technology companies depend on to hire tens of thousands of employees each year. If implemented, the reforms could shift the way American companies like Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. recruit talent and force wholesale changes at Indian companies such as Infosys Ltd. and Wipro Ltd. Businesses would have to try to hire American first and if they recruit foreign workers, priority would be given to the most highly paid. Wipro, Infosys and TCS shares all tumbled Tuesday along with other Indian tech services companies, pulling down the NSE Nifty Index. Wipro fell the most in nine months, while Tech Mahindra Ltd. dropped the most in almost two years. Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., a New Jersey-based company that is one of the heaviest users of the H-1B program, saw shares fall 4.4 percent Monday, the most in four months.Lyft rides a wave of anger to the top of the App Store: This weekend, Uber and Lyft — in their reactions to the Trump administration’s immigration order — illustrated how important companies' political views have become to consumers. Lyft took a public stand against the order and, on Sunday, saw more downloads than Uber for the first time ever, according to analysis firm App Annie. Lyft's Sunday downloads also more than doubled its daily average over the previous two weeks. Uber, on the other hand, had a bad weekend. Hundreds of people called for ride-sharers to ditch the company through the hashtag “#deleteUber” after it announced that it would drop surge pricing for John F. Kennedy Airport trips. Many saw Uber’s move as an attempt to undermine the strike that New York City cabdrivers organized to protest the immigration order and capitalize off the controversy — something Uber was quick to deny. It also didn't help Uber's standing among President Trump's critics that its chief executive is on the administration's business advisory committee. The social reaction to the Uber-Lyft divide was immediate. App Annie confirmed that Lyft climbed the app charts on both Apple and Android phones this weekend. It overtook Uber to reach No. 1 on the Apple App Store. That bump came despite the fact that Lyft didn’t suspend its service during the strike either and despite Lyft's ties to another close Trump ally, investor Peter Thiel. Its pledge over the weekend, however, seemed to speak louder than those facts — and louder than a later Uber vow to devote $3 million to help its drivers with immigration legal costs.Dropbox claims $1B revenue run rate: Today at an event in San Francisco in which it announced updates to its Paper app and its Smart Sync feature, Dropbox CEO Drew Houston talked up the company’s revenue growth and self-serve business model. Houston claimed that Dropbox was on pace for a $1 billion revenue run rate and that the company was free-cash flow positive, which could bolster the company’s plans for a rumored late-2017 IPO. To be sure, a $1 billion run rate would be impressive. Box reported in its last quarter that it generated $102.8 million in revenue. Box, from the get-go, gunned for enterprises and for the large part has built a brand around the company — and Aaron Levie — as one that specializes in enterprise software. That’s given it the capability of selling itself to larger companies over a company that has largely held a strong consumer brand like Dropbox. But just having a $1 billion run rate doesn’t mean that Dropbox’s work is done. While it works to rapidly build a strong enterprise product, it has companies like Salesforce acquiring Quip for $750 million and placing it in a position to beat out its note-taking app Paper.Silicon Valley’s Ambivalence Toward Trump Turns to Anger: Mr. Trump’s executive order late on Friday temporarily blocked all refugees while also denying entry to citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other predominantly Muslim countries. The directives struck at the heart of Silicon Valley’s cherished values, its fabled history and, not least, its embrace-the-world approach to customers. Two worldviews collided: the mantra of globalization that underpins the advance of technology and the nationalistic agenda of the new administration. In response, a significant part of the tech community went to the barricades. Netflix’s chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Trump’s actions “are so un-American it pains us all” and that “it is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity.” Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, made the same point. “We must stand with those who are affected,” he wrote on Twitter. Sergey Brin, a Google founder who immigrated from the Soviet Union when he was 6, seemed to take that suggestion literally, attending an impromptu protest on Saturday evening at San Francisco International Airport. When some of the demonstrators realized that the 10th-richest man in America was with them, they asked for selfies. He good-naturedly obliged.Cisco snaps up AppDynamics for $3.7B right before its IPO: Cisco said today that it would acquire AppDynamics, which helps companies monitor application performance, for a whopping $3.7 billion. And now, it would seem that AppDynamics’ long-awaited IPO (this week!) has been called off in favor of a giant acquisition. It isn’t Cisco’s first major acquisition in recent memory — in fact, the company has been quite active — with the company paying $1.4 billion for Jasper Technologies. All these seem to be moving Cisco from its era of its core hardware networking business. The idea of networking in general has evolved over time as new kinds of devices find their way onto the Internet, and now it would seem Cisco is continuing that move beyond its usual competency. AppDynamics may have even been testing the waters of the IPO market to set a value for itself for negotiations with larger companies for a potential acquisition. It’s not entirely uncommon that companies are working to not only drop a filing and intent to go public while having acquisition talks behind the scenes. AppDynamics previously raised $314.5 million, and was most recently valued at $1.9 billion. So the exit looks like it’s about a 2x jump from its previous valuation — which is not all that bad of an outcome in the scope of larger enterprise deals. The deal will be in cash and assumed equity awards, Cisco said in a statement.Samsung Galaxy Note 7 Crisis Signals Problems at Korea Inc.  With the Note 7, Samsung pushed its business model, as well as its technology, to the limit, according to Samsung officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity while the Note 7 investigation was being completed. Driven by the desire to prove it was more than a fast follower of Apple, Samsung rushed the Note 7 to market ahead of Apple’s iPhone 7. To fend off Chinese competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi, it packed the phone with new features, like waterproof technology and iris-scanning for added security. But battery scientists, including those who spoke at the announcement, said aggressive decisions in designing the batteries made problems more likely. Pushing to make the battery thinner and more powerful, Samsung opted for an exceptionally thin separator in its battery. As the critical component that separates the positive and negative electrodes in a battery, separators can cause fires if they break down or contain flaws. UL, a safety science company contracted by Samsung to investigate the battery, said the thin separator offered poor protection against defects. It also said that the high energy density of the battery could increase the severity of failures when they occurred. Samsung’s insistence on speed and internal pressures to outdo rivals in part signal a breakdown in the ability to truly innovate and push out new ideas, critics say. In place of big new ideas, Samsung focused on maxing out the capability of components like the battery. That philosophy, which worked to keep Samsung on the heels of the likes of Apple, simply is not as effective as Samsung tries to push ahead, they argue. But for many of the company’s critics, the most interesting part of the presentation was what Samsung did not say: How could such a technologically advanced titan — a symbol of South Korea’s considerable industrial might — allow the problems to happen to begin with? The answer to that question gets to deep shortfalls that former employees, suppliers and others who watch the company say may have contributed to the incident. Samsung, like South Korea as a whole, fosters a top-down, hidebound culture that stifles innovation and buries festering problems, they say. For those critics, these problems have come to light through another front: politics. Samsung has been caught up in a scandal surrounding the country’s president, which they say illustrates a hierarchical culture that tends to micromanage away creativity and insulate family-run business empires from accountability and competition.Jay Z is selling a third of Tidal, which makes sense. Sprint is buying a third of Tidal, which makes less sense. Jay Z hasn’t found a new owner for Tidal, his streaming music service. But he’s getting closer. Sprint says it has bought a third of Tidal; Billboard says the carrier is paying $200 million for its stake, which pegs Tidal’s value at $600 million. Sprint and the music service aren’t offering any other details, except that Sprint customers will get “exclusive artist content not available anywhere else” and that Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure will join Tidal’s board. Jay Z has been shopping Tidal for at least a year — Samsung, which seemed like a logical buyer, kicked its tires for a while, then walked away; everyone else gave it at least a look — so it’s logical to assume that this deal gives Sprint a “path to control”: The ability to buy a majority stake in the company over time. It’s also logical to see why he’d want to get out of the streaming business, which he entered by buying Aspiro, a Swedish streaming company, for $56 million in 2015: Everyone in the streaming music business loses money. That doesn’t matter to tech giants like Apple and Amazon, who use music to promote other products. It also doesn’t seem to matter to bigger streaming music companies like Pandora and Spotify, that have investors willing to bet that they’ll figure out how to turn a profit, one day. But if you’re Jay Z and you’re running a small scale streaming business — Tidal claims it has three million subscribers, though those numbers have been disputed — then you’re either funding those losses out of your pocket or getting someone else to do it for you. So an early exit would have always been part of the plan. Here’s a good hunch: In a year or so, Jay Z will have sold the whole thing to Sprint, which will be left trying to figure that problem out for itself.Tesla rolling out Autopilot to cars built since October, will limit Autosteer to 45 mph: Tesla is rolling out its Autopilot software to Model S and Model X cars built since October, which are equipped with second-generation Autopilot hardware, according to a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The cars have been without a litany of safety features that are available in many older Tesla cars. The Autopilot software is being deployed to eligible Teslas over-the-air, and owners will not need to do anything special for the software to be downloaded. However, new Teslas still will not have all the Autopilot and semi-autonomous features that older Teslas have. And some cars, Musk says, will need to have their on-board cameras adjusted by Tesla’s service department for Autopilot to work correctly. Cars with Gen 2 Autopilot hardware will now have a speed-limited version of Autosteer, the feature that most owners consider to be “Autopilot.” It will work at speeds below 45 mph, and is meant for use on highways with clear lane markings. It helps maintain position within the lane in slow-moving traffic. It works with the traffic-aware cruise control system (TACC), which is also rolling out with the update. TACC allows the vehicle adjust its speed based on the car ahead, decelerating or accelerating as needed. TACC is currently limited to a maximum speed of 75 mph. Previously, cars with second-generation Autopilot hardware only had basic cruise control. Vehicles are also gaining Forward Collision Warning (FCW), where the car will alert the driver when there is an object in your path and a collision is likely. The system will sound a chime and give a visual warning on the instrument panel. The car will not have Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), where the car can apply the brakes in an attempt to avoid or reduce the severity of a crash.Uber Hires Google’s Former Head of Search, Stoking a Rivalry: Uber and Google have long been bitter rivals in the race to build the autonomous vehicles that appear integral to the future of transportation. Soon, Uber will have a bit of help in that effort from a man who has played a key role in Google’s history. Amit Singhal, a 15-year Google veteran and a former senior vice president for search at the company, said on Friday that he planned to join Uber as senior vice president for engineering. At Uber, he will work to build out the software and infrastructure that are the foundation of the company’s ride-hailing services. In his new position, Mr. Singhal will report to Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, and will lead the company’s mapping division as well as a unit that runs the dispatching, marketing and pricing of Uber cars. Mr. Singhal will also advise Anthony Levandowski, who runs the company’s self-driving automobile efforts. The hiring of Mr. Singhal, who left Google last year, is a coup for Uber, which has publicly stated its intention to fight Google’s substantial head start in autonomous-vehicle research. Uber has poached multiple high-level employees from Google over the past seven years, including Brian McClendon, a mapping expert, and Mr. Levandowski, a veteran of self-driving-car research. Hired by Google in 2000, he was the company’s 176th employee, and he rewrote many of the original search algorithms created by the company’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Mr. Singhal is credited as one of the engineers who built the smarter and faster search engine that gave Google what proved to be an insurmountable advantage in web search.Mark Zuckerberg, in Suit, Testifies in Oculus Intellectual Property Trial: Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, has said virtual reality could be the next big thing in technology. While virtual reality hasn’t quite reached the mainstream, it has succeeded in landing Mr. Zuckerberg in the middle of a courtroom fight over who owns a crucial piece of the technology. The dispute started two and a half years ago when a videogame publisher, ZeniMax Media, sued Oculus VR, a start-up behind a virtual reality headset, only months after Facebook announced that it would acquire Oculus for $2 billion. ZeniMax accused Oculus of stealing important elements of the technology that went into the creation of the headset, eventually including Facebook among the parties it was suing. While fights over ownership of prominent technologies are common, this one defied some predictions by making it to a jury trial, which started in a federal court here in early January. On Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg made a rare appearance in court and was questioned about the Oculus deal. While pushing back on accusations that Oculus took technology that it didn’t own, Mr. Zuckerberg said it was his first time testifying in a courtroom. “We are highly confident that Oculus products are built on Oculus technology,” said Mr. Zuckerberg, who wore a suit while testifying, instead of his regular uniform of a hoodie and jeans. “The idea that Oculus products are based on someone else’s technology is just wrong.” Facebook could face hefty damages if it loses the suit, which could make its payoff from virtual reality recede further into the future. While virtual reality has excited people in the technology industry, most headsets, including those from Oculus, are not selling in big numbers because of high prices and limited content for them. The core of ZeniMax’s case is that one of its former employees, John Carmack, shared ZeniMax virtual reality technology with Palmer Luckey, a founder of Oculus, during the early days of Oculus, technology for which ZeniMax was never compensated. Mr. Carmack, a game industry stalwart behind games like Doom, later joined Oculus.Snapdeal revenues up 56% but losses more than doubled to $436 mn in FY2015-16: Jasper Infotech Pvt. Ltd, which runs online marketplace Snapdeal, more than doubled its losses to Rs 2,960 crore (around $436 million) in the financial year ended 31 March 2016. Its total revenues went up by 56% to Rs 1,456.6 crore in FY2015-16. It had garnered revenues of Rs 933.3 crore with a net loss of Rs 1,319.2 crore in the previous financial year, according to filings with the Registrar of Companies. The company’s consolidated loss grew to Rs 3,315 crore from Rs 1,328 crore in FY2014-15. This implies that the firm lost Rs 9 crore every day in the past year. Snapdeal-owned digital payments firm FreeCharge clocked losses of Rs 270 crore, while its logistics firm Vulcan Express netted losses of Rs 20 crore. Gojavas, where Snapdeal owns a 49.9% stake, saw losses of Rs 70 crore. The company’s TV shopping joint venture with DEN Networks witnessed losses of Rs 45 crore in FY2015-16. The firm’s employee benefit expenses tripled to Rs 911.1 crore from Rs 367.2 crore. Snapdeal’s provision for bad debts increased significantly to Rs 303.9 crore in the last financial year from Rs 9.6 crore in the previous year. Advertising promotional expenses and packing expenses increased 22% to Rs 574 crore. In September 2015, Snapdeal had acquired US-based Reduce Data Inc, a startup that runs a programmatic display advertising platform. The documents filed with the Registrar of Companies show that the acquisition was made for just $0.05 or around Rs 3. Snapdeal’s competitors Flipkart and Amazon also saw their losses double in the last financial year.Samsung Succession in Disarray as Lee Criminal Case Advances: The long-orchestrated plan to cement Jay Y. Lee’s position atop Samsung Group may put him in jail instead, raising questions about who would step in to run South Korea’s biggest conglomerate in the aftermath. Prosecutors are seeking Lee’s arrest on allegations including bribery and embezzlement, which if proven could prompt him to relinquish duties at the family business. Potential replacements include executives running key divisions of the dominant electronics business, as well as a sister -- hotel executive Lee Boo-jin. While a long shot, her anointment would mark a seismic shift in the way the nation’s patriarchal empires are run.Even if the accusations against him involving South Korea’s president are proven in court, it’s still possible Lee could return to the company later or even call the shots from behind bars, just as executives from Hyundai Motor Co. and SK Group have done. “Chaebol executives have a history of managing from the jail, whether it be via lawyers or secretaries visiting them,” said Lee Kyung-mook, a professor at Seoul National University’s Graduate School of Business. Lee’s potential arrest in the scandal surrounding President Park Geun-hye is another calamity for the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics Co., the largest maker of mobile devices. Last year, the company pulled its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone off the shelves because some devices burst into flames. The debacle cost Suwon-based Samsung an estimated $6 billion and a competitive advantage before Apple Inc. released its iPhone 7 models. Lee, 48, has had trouble matching the success of his father, Lee Kun-hee, who transformed Samsung Electronics from a copycat appliance maker into a global powerhouse in TVs, smartphones and memory chips. The elder Lee -- South Korea’s richest man -- suffered a crippling heart attack in May 2014, and Samsung shares fell that year and the next before recovering in 2016.China's Baidu opens augmented reality lab to boost waning profits: Chinese search engine Baidu Inc on Monday launched an augmented reality (AR) lab in Beijing as part of a $200 million effort to revitalize the company's shrinking profits with cutting edge technology. The lab, which currently employs 55 people, will initially aim to drive revenue through AR marketing, though will later explore healthcare and education. Popularised in 2016 by Nintendo Co Ltd's Pokemon Go game, augmented reality involves rendering virtual images over real life settings viewed on a smartphone, headset or other device. In marketing, the software can be used to animate a product or a branded space. Baidu's AR launch comes as the company gears up to report full-year earnings next month. It has forecast a revenue drop of around 4.6 percent as it grapples with the aftermath of new government curbs on medical advertising. Those curbs have slashed into the profits of its core search business and saw ad customers drop 16 percent in the quarter ended in September.Six-Hour Meeting of Chinese Tycoons Eases LeEco Cash Crunch: It took Jia Yueting just over six hours in December to snag $2.2 billion from a Chinese real estate mogul to keep LeEco afloat. In so doing, the entrepreneur secured a vital financial and strategic ally as he prepares to do battle with the likes of Tencent Holdings  and Tesla. Jia’s LeEco, the sprawling conglomerate with interests ranging from electric cars and TVs to entertainment, announced Friday its cash crunch was almost over after winning 16.8 billion yuan in strategic investments, mostly from Sun Hongbin’s Sunac China Holdings Ltd. Jia declared he’ll now use the money to “far surpass” China’s three biggest internet companies: Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.  Jia said on Sunday most of the money, around 10 billion yuan, will be paid to him in exchange for the shares he controls. The deal makes Sun and his company the second-largest shareholder in LeEco and ends a months-long quest for capital that quickened after Jia publicly admitted in November LeEco had expanded too quickly and was facing a squeeze. “With Sunac China, LeEco will no longer fight alone,” Jia told journalists in a five-star Beijing hotel ballroom on Sunday. “This is the first time for LeEco has introduced or had a second major shareholder so it’s a very important turning point.” Tianjin-based Sunac is the white knight that’s signed on to Jia’s vision. Chairman Sun Hongbin, who hails also from Jia’s home province of Shanxi, said he was inspired to invest after the meeting with Jia, who at the time was trying to sell company property to raise money.SpaceX nailed its first launch since last year’s big explosion: Early Saturday morning Jan. 14, SpaceX successfully launched ten communication satellites made by Iridium — one of its largest satellite customers — into low earth orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The mission, part of a larger effort to replace at least 70 of Iridium’s satellites by 2018, was a much-needed positive start to what should be a busy year for SpaceX. SpaceX has a lot to accomplish in 2017, but it’s crucial to remember that all of this is in service of the company’s ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars. That’s why each commercial launch is critical for the company Elon Musk founded 15 years ago. Not only is it proving that the technology works, but each contract is helping Musk fund his ambitious and expensive mission to colonize Mars. Saturday’s unblemished execution — from launch, to completing the mission of deploying the satellites, to landing back on its drone ship — is a good sign for the company, particularly after one of its $60 million rockets exploded with a $200 million satellite on it last August.China's anti-Teslas: cheap models drive electric car boom: More electric cars are sold in China than in the rest of the world combined, but are mainly locally-branded models that are cheaper and have a shorter range than those offered by foreign automakers such as Tesla  and Nissan. The Chinese-branded electric vehicle (EV) market is propped up by huge government subsidies as part of Beijing's policy to build global leadership in cleaner energy driving. China has spent billions of dollars on subsidies to help companies including Warren Buffett-backed BYD  and BAIC Motor achieve large-scale production of plug-in vehicles, which are gaining traction among urban drivers as well as taxi fleets and government agencies. Sales of battery electric and plug-in hybrids increased 60 percent in January-November, to 402,000 vehicles. By 2020, China wants 5 million plug-in cars on its roads.  The domestic EVs don't have the 'wow' factor of a fast, longer-range and luxury-style Tesla. They sell on price. Some EV buyers in Beijing and Shanghai said they primarily bought plug-in vehicles to easily get a license plate. Half a dozen of China's biggest cities tightly control license plates for traditional gasoline cars, but freely award plates that can only be used by plug-in vehicles.How Netflix Is Deepening Our Cultural Echo Chambers: For a brief while, from the 1950s to the late 1980s, broadcast television served cultural, social and political roles far greater than the banality of its content would suggest. Because it featured little choice, TV offered something else: the raw material for a shared culture. Television was the thing just about everyone else was watching at the same time as you. In its enforced similitude, it became a kind of social glue, stitching together a new national identity across a vast, growing and otherwise diverse nation. “What we gained was a shared identity and shared experience,” Mr. Strate said. “The famous example was Kennedy’s funeral, where the nation mourned together in a way that had never happened before. But it was also our experience watching ‘I Love Lucy’ and ‘All in the Family’ that created a shared set of references that everyone knew.” As the broadcast era changed into one of cable and then streaming, TV was transformed from a wasteland into a bubbling sea of creativity. But it has become a sea in which everyone swims in smaller schools.Google’s parent has given up on one of its big, futuristic projects: Google's parent company, Alphabet, is scaling back its ambitions for Internet by drone. It has disbanded the team that had been developing the technology, according to the company. Dozens of employees in the group, known as Titan, have been reassigned to work on other projects. They include Project Wing, Alphabet's effort to develop a drone delivery service, and Project Loon, which seeks to deliver Internet around the world via floating balloons. That project is still going strong, Alphabet says. Many of the Titan workers came from drone maker Titan Aerospace, which Google purchased in 2014. Titan was folded into X, Alphabet's moonshot lab, in late 2015. “We ended our exploration of high altitude UAVs for internet access shortly after,” an X spokesman said in a statement. \"… at this stage the economics and technical feasibility of Project Loon present a much more promising way to connect rural and remote parts of the world.”How Yahoo came up with its new name: Altaba: Yahoo was already a shell of its former self. Now part of the company is getting an obscure new name: Altaba. When Verizon agreed to buy the company for $4.8 billion in July, it planned to purchase just Yahoo's core Internet businesses, which include its email service, sports verticals and various apps. What's left of the embattled technology company would essentially be its ownership in the very valuable Chinese Internet giant Alibaba. When the deal closes, the remaining part will change its name to Altaba, the company announced in security filings on Monday. The sale is expected to be completed by late March, Yahoo said. The new name is meant to be a combination of the words “alternative and Alibaba,” Today Yahoo owns roughly 15 percent of Alibaba, holdings that are worth about $35 billion. The idea behind the name is that Altaba’s stock can now be tracked as an alternative to Alibaba because Yahoo owns a sizable chunk of the Chinese company. The name change reflects just how far Yahoo has fallen. The company that was once an Internet giant and is still the third most visited Web property in the United States is now essentially a vehicle for holding Alibaba's stock. The new company, which will be publicly traded and until now has been referred to as RemainCo in security filings, also owns a 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, the company’s Japanese affiliate, and Yahoo’s cash, as well as a patent portfolio that is being sold off in a separate auction.Snapchat becomes latest tech firm to pick London despite Brexit: Messaging app Snapchat said it would make London the home of its international operations, delivering another vote of confidence in Britain's tech standing as the country prepares to leave the European Union. The company, which has 150 million daily users globally, will book sales in countries where it has no local entity in Britain rather than routing them through lower tax jurisdictions like Ireland and Luxembourg as some other U.S. tech companies do. Snap Inc, which plans to go public this year in the biggest U.S. stock market debt since 2014, said the UK's strong creative industries made the country \"a great place to build a global business\". Despite the uncertainty sparked by the Brexit vote, London has remained attractive to global tech firms due to its pool of talent in the creative and tech sectors, many of whom have come from Europe and further afield. The city's position as a global financial hub also provides access to funding for start ups and capital for larger companies.Parrot is laying off a third of its drone division: Drone makers are having a tough time competing with China’s DJI. Parrot, the French drone maker, announced today it is planning to lay off one-third of its drone-related workforce — about 290 employees — after poor performance in its fourth quarter caused it to miss sales estimates by 15 percent. Specifically, Parrot said margins are so low in the consumer drone business that it wouldn’t be able to generate “profitable growth ... over the medium and long term.”Why Flipkart has turned to Kalyan Krishnamurthy: New CEO Kalyan Krishnamurthy’s main objective will be to make the budding Flipkart turnaround last. On Monday, Flipkart said Krishnamurthy, who was parachuted to the company for a second spell only last June, will replace Binny Bansal as chief executive officer (CEO) of Flipkart, exactly one year after Binny had replaced Sachin. Binny will become Flipkart group CEO. Ananth Narayanan, CEO of Flipkart’s fashion units Myntra and Jabong, and Sameer Nigam, CEO of Flipkart’s payment unit PhonePe, will continue reporting to Binny. Krishnamurthy will now control all of Flipkart and report to Binny. Krishnamurthy’s elevation marks a major landmark for the start-up ecosystem: he has become the first so-called professional CEO at a large Indian start-up.Ten years after the iPhone, Apple is still looking for something to top it: As Apple celebrates 10 years since the introduction of the iPhone, investors and consumers alike are impatiently waiting for Apple’s next big hit. But it turns out topping the iPhone is no easy task. After all, Apple has sold a billion of the suckers and, in the process, redefined mobile computing and became the world’s most valuable company. The 2007 debut of the iPhone showed Apple at its best — entering a new category and completely changing the rules of the game. Apple did so with the iPod in 2001 and again a few years later with the iTunes Music Store. But, as revolutionary as those products were, Apple wasn’t alone in seeing those opportunities — it just had a far better answer than anyone else. When the iPod debuted, there were other MP3 players on the market, even others with a hard drive — they were just big and clunky. Similarly, others tried to sell music before and after iTunes, but Apple’s simplicity won the day. Even with the iPhone, plenty of people saw the collision of the phone, internet and iPod coming, but Apple was alone in its vision of how that combination should work. For its next act, though, it is highly likely the company will have to go further afield. Whether it’s a car or something in digital health or augmented reality, it is clear that Apple will have to acquire at least as many outside skills as those it already has.Move Over Mobile Phone: The Next Ad Frontier is the Windshield. The next frontier in digital advertising may be your car’s windshield. Automakers, technology companies and glass manufacturers are teaming up to turn the display that graces the front of an iPhone into the windshield of a car -- one that can show ads, directions and vehicle information to the person behind the wheel. The advent of connected cars is creating a new sales battleground, and using a vehicle’s windshield may be the next way to pitch more products and services to consumers. McKinsey & Co. estimates that mobile and data-driven services in autos will generate $1.5 trillion by 2030. At least part of that will be spent projecting information to drivers and passengers right before their eyes. “When you think of a person driving and what your needs are when you’re on a typical trip, it’s food, it’s fuel and it’s rest stops,” said John Butler, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst. “Owning the inside of the car is critical, it’s really where the money is made. The real value is locked up in the ad opportunity.” Here’s how a smart windshield may work. A driver that’s close to running out of gas would see an alert pop up that notes the fuel situation and offers to find a nearby gas station. The car’s virtual assistant will offer a choice, again on the windshield, of two options, including directions to a station where the driver is eligible for a free cup of coffee -- an ad placed by the gas company that fits with the driver’s buying patterns, also known by his smart car. Panasonic Corp. demonstrated technology at CES, the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas this week, that lets a driver order and pay for fast food through a heads-up display, before pulling off the freeway to collect it.Saudi embrace of ride-hailing apps drives economic, social change: Saudi Arabia hopes its plan to bring a further 1.3 million women into the workforce by 2030 will be given a lift from ride-hailing apps Uber and Dubai-based rival Careem. The cars, which the government says should only be driven by Saudi men, offer women, who are banned from driving in the conservative Muslim country, an alternative to being driven to work by chauffeurs, male relatives or the shabby taxi system. Ride-hailing apps have come under intense scrutiny from governments and regulators across the globe as they disrupt traditional taxi businesses. But Saudi Arabia courted Uber and Careem, offering state investments, to support its Vision 2030 economic reform plan. With a budget squeezed by lower oil prices, the plan aims to draw workers away from government jobs by creating 450,000 private sector positions by 2020. Uber and Careem say they will create up to 200,000 jobs for Saudi men in the next two years. By offering women a way to get to work, it should also help meet the plan's goal of increasing the female workforce by five percentage points in the next five years to 28 percent. \"This is the next best thing to women being able to drive, because you are in control of your time, no more wasteful waiting around,” said Marwa Afandi, a 36-year-old marketing executive. With the workforces of Uber and Careem easily expected to overtake the 65,000 nationals employed by state oil giant Saudi Aramco, the kingdom has invested in both companies. Saudi's sovereign wealth fund put $3.5 billion into Uber in June 2016 while state-controlled Saudi Telecom Co announced on Dec. 18 it bought 10 percent of Careem for $100 million.Medium says it can’t make money selling ads so it’s laying off a third of its staff: Medium CEO Ev Williams says his company’s ad-based business model isn’t working, and the startup is laying off 50 employees and closing its offices in New York and Washington, D.C., as a result. That’s about one third of the company’s employees. In a blog post shared on Wednesday, Williams said he wants to move away from ad-supported content, which is how most stuff on the internet generates revenue. Williams described that business model, which is almost entirely dependent on clicks and views, as a “broken system.” “The vast majority of articles, videos, and other ‘content’ we all consume on a daily basis is paid for — directly or indirectly — by corporations who are funding it in order to advance their goals,” Williams wrote. “And it is measured, amplified, and rewarded based on its ability to do that. Period. As a result, we get … well, what we get. And it’s getting worse.” Medium simply grew too quickly, according to a person close to the company, and laying off 50 people is part of Medium’s plan to cut costs while it figures out what comes next. Medium has raised more than $130 million from a number of well-known investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures, Greylock and Spark Capital. Its most recent funding round, back in April, valued the company at more than $600 million.Apple pulls New York Times app from iTunes store in China: Apple, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month. The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software. The government began blocking The Times’s websites in 2012, after a series of articles on the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister, but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the Chinese-language app.  Apple removed both the English-language and Chinese-language apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app store.India Poised to Reject Apple’s Demand for Manufacturing Sops: India is not in favor of offering Apple Inc. concessions to start manufacturing iPhones in the country, a government official told reporters on Tuesday. The government is also unlikely to ease norms governing local sourcing for the manufacturer of iPads and iPhones as such a step can’t be granted to just one company, according to the New Delhi-based official, who didn’t want to be identified citing rules on speaking to the media.Two reasons the red Solo Cup is a marvel of modern engineering: The red Solo Cup is an elegant piece of technology. It's easy to forget when you find them strewn across the room, half-filled with leftover beer or crushed underfoot from parties the night before. But what many take for granted as simply a cheap, disposable beverage holder is the result of careful, beautiful engineering by people such as Robert Hulseman. While regular users may admire the Solo Cup's lightness and balance, particularly when filled to the brim with libation, some of the most underappreciated aspects of the cup can be traced to a simple design aimed at solving a rather sticky problem. Before the invention of the Solo Cup as we know it, it was often difficult to remove one disposable cup from a whole stack because of the way they sometimes clung together, and designs aimed at eliminating the issue resulted in production irregularities that drove up costs and increased the likelihood of cup breakage. For a thing whose whole job is to hold other things, this outcome simply would not do. Enter the plastic Solo Cup, which won a patent in 1976. Described as \"an expendable thin walled cup for liquids and the like,\" the Solo Cup offered two key innovations that, according to the company, helped solve the sticking associated with large stacks of cups as well as the hard problem of cleanly removing the plastic cups from the production molds.One of the Solo Cup's distinguishing features, according to the patent, was the curved lip of each cup (see 10a in Fig.3). When several cups were stacked together, the lips would \"engage\" — to use the company's language — and rest upon each other, keeping one cup from sinking too tightly into the next. But, Solo Cup Co. observed, this helped create another problem. When cups like these were subjected to crushing forces from various angles, the bottoms could warp in ways that actually made it harder to separate the cups. So the bottoms had to be reinforced (see Fig. 4, Fig. 6 and 26-28 in Fig. 3). This is how the plastic Solo Cup gained indentations or divots in the base that made the bottoms more rigid and allowed for more air flow between each stacked cup, which allegedly had the side benefit of helping the cups come apart.Silicon Valley's obscure unicorns could boost 2017 IPO market: Social media firm Snap Inc may be the highest profile tech IPO planned for 2017, with the potential to raise billions. But more than a dozen expected stock offerings of relatively obscure software firms targeting business customers - little-known names such as Apttus, Tintri and Okta - could be just as important in thawing a long-frozen IPO market, according to investment bankers and advisers who work on IPOs.Such enterprise software companies generally sell their services through subscriptions that produce reliable revenue streams. They aim to sign contracts lasting several years, giving investors more predictable returns than many Internet or consumer-oriented companies that depend on advertising or high volumes of individual transactions. The firms provide a range of back-of-the-house services, such as automating business processes, security, accounting, training software and expense management. Although such companies have moderate valuations, between about $500 million and $4 billion, the sector accounts for most of the tech IPO market. Apttus, for example, helps salespeople give a price quote quickly when trying to close a complicated deal that includes different products.U.S. evicts Russians for spying, imposes sanctions after election hacks: President Barack Obama on Thursday ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian suspected spies and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over their involvement in hacking U.S. political groups in the 2016 presidential election. The measures, taken during the last days of Obama's presidency, mark a new post-Cold War low in U.S.-Russian ties, which have deteriorated over differences about Syria and Ukraine. Allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russian President Vladimir Putin personally directed efforts to intervene in the U.S. election process by hacking mostly Democrats have made relations even worse. It was not clear whether President-elect Donald Trump, who has repeatedly praised Putin and nominated people seen as friendly toward Moscow to senior administration posts, would seek to roll back the measures once he takes office.How Russia Recruited Elite Hackers for Its Cyberwar: For more than three years, rather than rely on military officers working out of isolated bunkers, Russian government recruiters have scouted a wide range of programmers, placing prominent ads on social media sites, offering jobs to college students and professional coders, and even speaking openly about looking in Russia’s criminal underworld for potential talent. In Russia, recruiters have looked well beyond the nation’s school system. Those recruits were intended to cycle through military contracting companies and newly formed units called science squadrons established on military bases around the country. As early as 2013, Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, told university rectors at a meeting in Moscow that he was on a “head hunt in the positive meaning of the word” for coders. In 2013, as Russia’s recruitment drive was picking up, Dmitry A. Artimovich, a soft-spoken physicist, was awaiting trial in a Moscow jail for designing a computer program that spammed email users with advertisements for male sexual enhancement products. One day a cellmate, who had been convicted of selling narcotics online, sidled up to him with some news. The cellmate said that people incarcerated for cybercrimes could get out before trial, in exchange for working for the government. Another inmate had already taken a deal, he said. “It was an offer to cooperate,” Mr. Artimovich said. “Why else would you work for the government?” he added. “The salaries are tiny. But if you do something illegal, and go to prison for eight or nine years, the F.S.B. can help you,” he said, using a Russian abbreviation for the Federal Security Service.How China Built ‘iPhone City’ With Billions in Perks for Apple’s Partner: A hidden bounty of benefits for Foxconn’s plant in Zhengzhou, the world’s biggest iPhone factory, is central to the production of Apple’s most profitable product. A vast, boxy customs center acts as a busy island of commerce deep in central China. Government officers, in sharply pressed uniforms, race around a maze of wooden pallets piled high with boxes — counting, weighing, scanning and approving shipments. Unmarked trucks stretch for more than a mile awaiting the next load headed for Beijing, New York, London and dozens of other destinations. The state-of-the-art facility was built several years ago to serve a single global exporter: Apple, now the world’s most valuable company and one of China’s largest retailers. The well-choreographed customs routine is part of a hidden bounty of perks, tax breaks and subsidies in China that supports the world’s biggest iPhone factory, according to confidential government records reviewed by The New York Times, as well as more than 100 interviews with factory workers, logistics handlers, truck drivers, tax specialists and current and former Apple executives. The package of sweeteners and incentives, worth billions of dollars, is central to the production of the iPhone, Apple’s best-selling and most profitable product. It all centers on Zhengzhou, a city of six million people in an impoverished region of China. Running at full tilt, the factory here, owned and operated by Apple’s manufacturing partner Foxconn, can produce 500,000 iPhones a day. Locals now refer to Zhengzhou as “iPhone City.” The local government has proved instrumental, doling out more than $1.5 billion to Foxconn to build large sections of the factory and nearby employee housing. It paved roads and built power plants. It helps cover continuing energy and transportation costs for the operation. It recruits workers for the assembly line. It pays bonuses to the factory for meeting export targets. All of it in support of iPhone production. “We needed something that could really develop this part of the country,” said Li Ziqiang, a Zhengzhou official. “There’s an old saying in China: ‘If you build the nest, the birds will come.’ And now, they’re coming.” American officials have long decried China’s support of its state-owned companies, calling the subsidies and other aid an unfair competitive advantage in a global marketplace. But the Zhengzhou operation shows the extent of China’s effort to entice overseas multinationals to set up production facilities in the country.China tech giant LeEco in talks on $1.4 billion support, starts e-car plant: Cash-strapped Chinese technology conglomerate LeEco is in talks on securing a 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) deal with an unnamed strategic investor, its listed unit said. Leshi Internet Information and Technology  said in a filing to the stock exchange late Wednesday that its parent company had signed a framework agreement with the investor and the two sides were still discussing the final details. It did not disclose the identity of the investor, but the China Business News cited a source familiar with the situation as saying that it was an insurance company. LeEco has been expanding aggressively in a range of businesses including online entertainment, electric and driverless cars and smartphones, but the firm's billionaire chief executive Jia Yueting warned staff last month that it had grown too fast and was facing cash shortages. Following the cash crunch, the firm's sports broadcasting unit said it would cut 10 percent of its staff and restructure its business. This week, LeSports still owed as much as $30 million in payments to the Beijing-based Super Sports Media Group, which holds exclusive rights to broadcast English Premier League games in China.AppDynamics posts long-awaited IPO filing: AppDynamics has revealed its filing for a U.S. IPO. The IT company, which helps businesses like Salesforce and IBM with applications management, is targeting a $100 million offering. Despite a competitive landscape, which includes New Relic and Dynatrace, AppDynamics has shown strong revenue growth over the past year. For the nine months ending in October, revenue came in at $158.4 million, compared to $102.8 million in the same period during the year prior, driven by strong growth in subscriptions. Losses widened slightly, with the company losing $95.1 million through October versus $92.4 million in the same period the year before. This means that last year, the losses were almost as high as AppDynamics’ revenue. AppDynamics has raised more than $300 million in funding over the past eight years and its largest shareholders are Greylock Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which each own 20.8 percent of the company. AppDynamics’ last known private market valuation stood at $1.9 billion. Revealing the filing right now suggests that the company is hoping to finally go public in late January or early February.Rent the Runway has raised a $60 million investment led by Fidelity; The company was profitable in 2016 on revenue north of $100 million. In March, Rent the Runway CEO Jennifer Hyman told Recode, “I think you need to assume it’s impossible to raise equity financing for the next two years.” Just nine months later, Rent the Runway has closed a new $60 million equity investment led by the mutual fund company Fidelity with additional money from existing investors like Bain Capital Ventures and TCV. What changed in that time? The startup best known for its dress rental business put together a profitable year on an Ebitda basis while growing its revenue to well over $100 million. Rent the Runway also launched a new product — a $139-a-month rental subscription for everyday workwear — that accounted for more than one-fifth of total company revenue in its first year. The deal underscores a renewed focus on profitability for investors and fast-growing startups alike. Just this week, news broke that the subscription meal-kit company Blue Apron — another Fidelity portfolio company — was pausing its IPO plans to focus on widening its profit margins. The investment is another bet by Fidelity, which has also backed both Uber and Airbnb, on the so-called sharing economy. In this instance, the belief is that more women will view clothing rentals beyond dresses as the norm in the future. The valuation of this Series E investment was a “significant step up” from the $520 million valuation Rent the Runway earned when it raised a $60 million round in 2014. Hyman declined to provide more specifics on the new valuation other than that it was based on the types of metrics and multiples on which public companies are valued.WTF is a liquidation preference? Let’s walk through the basics. Broadly, a liquidation preference determines who gets what when a company is liquidated. This can mean when a company is merged, when it’s sold, when there’s a change of control of the company or when there’s a wind-down. In all of these scenarios, a company’s liquidator looks at the company’s secured and unsecured loan agreements, along with who owns preferred versus common stock. (Preferred shares are what VCs typically buy to ensure that they’re repaid ahead of holders of common shares.) Everyone on the company’s cap table is ranked after that, and the liquidator distributes the proceeds of a sale accordingly. Consider the wind-down scenario. Let’s say a company raised both venture capital and venture debt — a loan. Say that as time went on, it began falling behind on its debt payments, and that its VCs decided it was a losing proposition to continue funding the company. If there was any capital remaining — say the company hadn’t burned through every last bit of its funding, or say some money was made from a sell-off of its remaining assets, like its intellectual property — its investors would be paid before anyone at the company saw a nickel. When the outcome is much better, the same thing basically happens — though who gets how much and when grows more complicated with every new round of funding a company raises. The reason: When investors make a liquidation preference a condition for investing in a startup, they do it in order to claim their part of the profits first. But later-stage investors can demand liquidation preferences that ensure they get paid before earlier investors, too. It’s kind of like a layer cake. They can also demand that they get paid back more than the standard of one times their money back. Why would startups agree to these seemingly onerous terms? Well, sometimes, they don’t have any choice. They take the terms, or they go out of business. Sometimes, startups wanting unicorn status will agree to the terms for a richer valuation, thinking it will attract press, customers and employees. Whether it’s worth the gamble takes time to play out. But certainly, things can get ugly when these same companies get sold rather than go public (a process that converts everyone’s shares to common shares). It’s uglier still when they sell for less than expected, the investors take their cut, and there’s little to nothing left for founders and employees. Not every deal involves liquidation preferences. You don’t typically see them in early-stage deals. You don’t seem them in deals where a company has been created by a founder whom VCs trip over themselves to fund. But they do start to appear as a company matures. (For some context, in recent quarters, senior liquidation preferences have been showing up in between 25 and 35 percent of deals, according to the law firm Fenwick & West, which studies these things.)Snapchat buying Israeli augmented reality start-up Cimagine: report: Messaging app Snapchat is buying Israeli augmented reality startup Cimagine Media for an estimated $30-$40 million, marking Snapchat's first acquisition in Israel, the Calcalist financial daily reported on Sunday. Cimagine developed True Marketless Augmented Reality – technology that allows users to virtually place furniture and appliances they wish to purchase in the space of their home, on their mobile devices, at the click of a button. Cimagine will become Snapchat's research and development center in Israel and is expected to rapidly expand its workforce from its current 20 employees, Calcalist said. The company's highly-skilled team is probably the main reason for the acquisition, rather than its technology, Calcalist said. The company was founded in 2012 and has raised a few million dollars. Venice, California-based Snapchat is expected to go public as early as March with a valuation of as much as $25 billion.Start-Ups Seek to Take Some of the Pain Out of Moving: Adam Pittenger, who has moved six times in six years, shares his home in Hoboken, N.J., with his girlfriend and a roommate. With his frequent firsthand experience as a guide, he started a company this year to help make moving less of a chore. His company, called Moved, is one of several that hope to shake up the nearly $17 billion moving industry with new technology and on-demand services. Meanwhile, traditional moving companies are coming up with their own innovations as more consumers prefer to conduct their business on computers and smartphones. Through a mobile app that incorporates chat features, Moved can help customers through a laundry list of responsibilities: selling furniture, donating goods, ordering boxes, changing addresses and finding packing, moving and storage services. Moved’s “concierge” services — locating and coordinating with service providers — are free; customers pay for what they use. Moved makes money through referral fees from its partners, which it says are vetted.U.S. companies want to play China’s game. They just can’t win it. Netflix has a nifty new China strategy: Skip it. Facebook’s China charm offensive, which included Mark Zuckerberg studying Mandarin, has yielded little. Google’s search business and Twitter remain blocked. LinkedIn and Microsoft censor — and still, neither is a major player in China’s online space. Amazon.com is sputtering along against the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. After great initial success, Apple is being overtaken by local upstarts. For some highflying U.S. Internet businesses, the China dream is fading; for others, it looks radically different from what they had hoped. California’s Internet companies once dreamed of liberating China with technology, thinking that the system of censorship known as the Great Firewall would inevitably crumble like the Berlin Wall, paving the way for their advance in the world’s most populous nation. But President Xi Jinping has tightened, rather than loosened, control of the Internet and increased restrictions on foreign companies. Six years after Google retreated from China’s search-engine business over censorship and hacking concerns, U.S. firms seem more willing than ever to play the Communist Party’s game — they just can’t win it. Even if they can gain a foothold, which is hard enough, there is practically no way they will be able to overtake the Chinese companies that have comfortably established themselves.Blue Apron Put IPO Plans on Hold to Focus on Financials: Meal-kit delivery company Blue Apron Inc. has put preparations for an initial public offering on hold, people familiar with the matter said, delaying selecting bankers while it focuses on improving its financial metrics. After starting to interview banks in September to advise on the IPO, Blue Apron has pushed back formally hiring underwriters until some time next year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details aren’t public. Even with more than $800 million in annual revenue this year, the company has struggled to improve profit margins as much as management wanted in the face of more competition, the people said. A stronger performance is needed to support the $3 billion valuation that the company was targeting in an IPO. This month, Blue Apron competitor HelloFresh AG took a haircut on its private valuation when raising new cash. The Berlin-based company is now valued at about 2.09 billion euros ($2.18 billion) including new money raised -- about 20 percent less than 15 months ago. Plated, a smaller rival, is worth less than $200 million, one of the people said. Those valuations will be on investors’ minds when evaluating a potential Blue Apron IPO, the people said.Uber removes its self-driving cars from San Francisco roads: Uber has removed its self-driving cars from San Francisco streets after California regulators cracked down on the week-old program because the company had not obtained a permit to test the vehicles. The California Department of Motor Vehicles said on Wednesday it revoked the registration of 16 Uber self-driving cars after a battle with the ride-services company. The agency had demanded that Uber comply with regulations requiring a permit to test self-driving cars on public roads - just as 20 other auto and technology companies have done. Uber said it was not obligated to have a permit because its vehicles require monitoring by a person in the car. California defines autonomous vehicles as having the capability to drive \"without the active physical control or monitoring of a natural person.\" Uber has argued that its cars are not able to drive without a person monitoring them - a driver and an engineer are in the front seats to take over frequently in situations such as a construction zone or pedestrian crossing - so the law does not apply.  Uber's defiance was met with threats of legal action from the DMV and the state attorney general. The DMV told Uber it can continue its self-driving pilot if it obtains the permit. Agency director Jean Shiomoto said in a letter sent to Uber on Wednesday that she would \"personally help to ensure an expedited review and approval process,\" which she described as \"simple and straightforward.\" It is not yet clear whether Uber will apply for the permit or simply bring the self-driving cars to another state.Alibaba Again Named ‘Notorious Market’ in Blow to Overseas Push: Alibaba has again been labeled a haven for knockoffs with an embarrassing return to a U.S. blacklist for fakes just four years after getting its name removed. The U.S. Office of the Trade Representative on Wednesday restored Alibaba’s Taobao to its lineup of “Notorious Markets,” citing an unacceptably high level of reported counterfeiting and piracy. The Hangzhou-based company said it was disappointed in the decision. While Alibaba has argued it’s doing all it can to combat fakes, Asia’s biggest Internet company now finds itself on the same list as torrent website Pirate Bay and flea markets in Brazil and Nigeria. The decision damages Alibaba’s credibility in the U.S., where its shares trade and it’s trying to cultivate relationships with retailers, brands and entertainment companies. Alibaba suggested its new designation could have been influenced by politics. “Our results speak for themselves,” Alibaba President Mike Evans said in a statement. “Unfortunately, the USTR’s decision leads us to question whether the USTR acted based on the actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate.”France is going to let drones start delivering the mail: The French postal service will soon start a new drone delivery program to carry parcels on a set nine-mile route following approval from the French aviation regulatory authority. It’s just an experiment for now, not a fully launched program, and will only operate once a week. But it is the first time a federal postal service will use drones to deliver on a regular route. The DPDgroup, a subsidiary of the French national postal service, has been perfecting its drone delivery project since 2014 in the south of France, working in partnership with Atechsys, a French drone company. In September 2015, the drone delivery project demonstrated its aircraft could fly in complete autonomy carrying a package weighing over three pounds a distance of nearly nine miles. Last Tuesday, Amazon released a video of its first customer drone delivery in the British countryside. And in China, online retailer JD.com started the trial of its drone delivery program in November with a fleet of 30 drones that ferry orders to locations in rural China outside of Beijing, as well as Jiangsu, Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces, according to the South China Morning Post.Building a Community, and an Empire, With a Gay Dating App in China: MA BAOLI was accustomed to secrets. By day, he was a police officer in northern China with a wife and a knack for street chases. By night, he led a life as a gay man, furtively running a website for gay people across China at a time when many were viewed as criminals and deviants. For 16 years, Mr. Ma kept his secret, worried that coming out would mean expulsion from the police force and estrangement from his family. Then in 2012, his superiors at a police department in Qinhuangdao, a coastal city in Hebei Province, uncovered his website and he resigned. His job lost, his family struggling to accept his sexuality, Mr. Ma set out to turn his passion for connecting gay people into an empire. He created Blued, now China’s most popular gay dating app with an estimated value of $600 million and more than three million active daily users, about as many as Grindr, a popular gay dating app in the United States. Mr. Ma said he was optimistic that long-entrenched stereotypes were fading in China and that within two decades, the country would embrace ideas like same-sex marriage. He quoted his idol, the Alibaba.com founder Jack Ma, in describing both the challenge of building a successful start-up in China and the struggles of the gay-rights movement. “When I’m at my most painful moments,” he said, “I remember what Jack Ma said: ‘Today is hard, tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be sunshine.’ ”Airbnb seeks to raise an additional $153 million: Airbnb on Friday authorized the sale of up to $153 million in equity to investors, according to venture capital database CB Insights, which obtained the company's financial filing. The funding is an extension of a round in September, when Airbnb raised more than $555 million, according to financial filings. Investors have valued the company at $30 billion. The price per-share for the sale is $105, up from the $93.09 share price the company commanded in its 2015 financing round, according to CB Insights.Nintendo Tumbles as Super Mario Run Game Debuts to Tepid Reviews: Nintendo Co. dropped in Tokyo as the debut of Super Mario run was met by lukewarm reviews. The stock tumbled 4.4 percent as of 10:36 a.m. on Monday, bringing its losses since the game’s debut last week to 8.4 percent. Nintendo’s partner DeNA Co., which helped with the game’s development, has dropped 12.4 percent in the same period. The title, which for now is only available for Apple Inc. devices, had nearly 50,000 reviews in the U.S. App Store, with an average rating of two and a half stars out of five. That’s among the lowest for apps at the top of download rankings and below other popular smartphone games like Clash Royale or Candy Crush Saga. Nintendo has been criticized for the cost of the game, which is free to download and play the first three levels but costs $10 for the full version. “Investor expectations were very strong,” said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute. “There are a lot of people writing on the App Store that Super Mario Run isn’t very fun. Perhaps expectations were too high.”Verizon Explores Lower Price or Even Exit From Yahoo Deal: Verizon Communications Inc. is exploring a price cut or possible exit from its $4.83 billion pending acquisition of Yahoo! Inc., after the company reported a second major e-mail hack affecting as many as 1 billion user accounts, according to a person familiar with the matter. While a Verizon group led by AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong is still focused on integration planning to get Yahoo up and running, another team, walled off from the rest, is reviewing the breach disclosures and the company’s options, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Yahoo shares fell as much as 6.5 percent to $38.25, the biggest intraday decline since February. Verizon rose less than 1 percent to $52.07. GitHub Is Building a Coder’s Paradise. It’s Not Coming Cheap: The VC-backed unicorn startup lost $66 million in nine months of 2016, financial documents show. Though the name GitHub is practically unknown outside technology circles, coders around the world have embraced the software. The startup operates a sort of Google Docs for programmers, giving them a place to store, share and collaborate on their work. But GitHub Inc. is losing money through profligate spending and has stood by as new entrants emerged in a software category it essentially gave birth to, according to people familiar with the business and financial paperwork reviewed by Bloomberg. The rise of GitHub has captivated venture capitalists. Sequoia Capital led a $250 million investment in mid-2015. But GitHub management may have been a little too eager to spend the new money. The company paid to send employees jetting across the globe to Amsterdam, London, New York and elsewhere. More costly, it doubled headcount to 600 over the course of about 18 months. GitHub lost $27 million in the fiscal year that ended in January 2016, according to an income statement seen by Bloomberg. It generated $95 million in revenue during that period, the internal financial document says. Sitting in a conference room featuring an abstract art piece on the wall and a Mad Men-style rollaway bar cart in the corner, GitHub’s Chris Wanstrath says the business is running more smoothly now and growing. “What happened to 2015?” says the 31-year-old co-founder and chief executive officer. “Nothing was getting done, maybe? I shouldn’t say that. Strike that.” “The whole product road map, we have all of our shit together in a way that we’ve never had together. I’m pretty elated right now with the way things are going,” says Wanstrath. “We’ve had a lot of ups and downs, and right now we’re definitely in an up.” Also up: expenses. The income statement shows a loss of $66 million in the first three quarters of this year. That’s more than twice as much lost in any nine-month time frame by Twilio Inc., another maker of software tools founded the same year as GitHub. At least a dozen members of GitHub’s leadership team have left since last year, several of whom expressed unhappiness with Wanstrath’s management style. GitHub says the company has flourished under his direction but declined to comment on finances. Wanstrath says: “We raised $250 million last year, and we’re putting it to use. We’re not expecting to be profitable right now.”Yahoo Says 1 Billion User Accounts Were Hacked: Yahoo, already reeling from its September disclosure that 500 million user accounts had been hacked in 2014, disclosed Wednesday that a different attack in 2013 compromised more than 1 billion accounts. The two attacks are the largest known security breaches of one company’s computer network. The newly disclosed 2013 attack involved sensitive user information, including names, telephone numbers, dates of birth, encrypted passwords and unencrypted security questions that could be used to reset a password. Yahoo said it is forcing all of the affected users to change their passwords and it is invalidating unencrypted security questions — steps that it declined to take in September. It is unclear how many Yahoo users were affected by both attacks. The internet company has more than 1 billion active users, but it is not clear how many inactive accounts were hacked. Yahoo said it discovered the larger hacking after analyzing data files, provided by law enforcement, that an unnamed third party had claimed contained Yahoo information.Meitu Makes Muted Debut in H.K.’s Biggest Tech IPO Since 2007: Chinese selfie-apps developer Meitu Inc. stood little changed from its offer price Thursday, a less-than-stellar debut for the biggest initial public offering since the start of a program that made it easier for mainland investors to buy and sell stocks in Hong Kong. Meitu’s IPO was also the biggest coming-out party for a tech company since 2007, when Alibaba.com Ltd. listed. Its shares stood at HK$8.50 at 9:49 a.m. local time, unchanged from an offer price that was already at the bottom of a marketed range. Meitu now has a valuation of HK$35.9 billion ($4.6 billion). The company, which runs apps including Meitu, Meipai and BeautyPlus, is ratcheting up a presence in overseas markets to lure more people beyond the existing 456 million monthly active users. Beauty Plus currently has more than 160 million users including in Japan, Indonesia and India. It will develop more localized features for people in the U.S., including tools that make people look tanned in their photos, said Cai.The California DMV says Uber has to stop operating its self-driving cars in SF:  The agency said it will have to take legal action otherwise. Also, an Uber self-driving car ran a red light on its first day in operation.Google Parent Company Spins Off Self-Driving Car Business: Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said on Tuesday that its autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company under the name Waymo. Alphabet’s decision to spin out Waymo is a signal that the company thinks its self-driving technology has advanced beyond research project status and is ready for commercialization. Autonomous vehicles are a hotly contested field of technology, pursued by other tech giants, promising upstarts and traditional automakers — all who see the potential of self-driving cars to upend the automobile industry. Advancements in sensor technology coupled with breakthroughs in machine learning — the ability of computers to learn from vast amounts of data and improve over time — mean driverless cars (essentially supercomputers on wheels) could become a regular sight on the roads over the next few years. The challenge for Google is to devise a successful strategy for making money from self-driving cars. Unlike Uber, it doesn’t have a ride-hailing service that can generate fares — at least not yet. And unlike Tesla or other automakers, it doesn’t have an auto manufacturing background to build cars or a network to sell them. Creating its own car would also require a significant investment to build a factory and establish a supply chain. It could work with automakers to supply autonomous driving systems — akin to how Google provides the Android operating system software to smartphone manufacturers. However, car companies are apprehensive about losing control of that crucial technology to Google. “Google has struggled to find a way to come to market,” said Roger Lanctot, an associate director at research firm Strategy Analytics. “We’ve come to the point where Google needs a return.”Why Google, Microsoft and Amazon Love the Sound of Your Voice: Not so long ago, voice recognition was comically rudimentary. An early version of Microsoft's technology running in Windows transcribed \"mom\" as \"aunt\" during a 2006 demo before an auditorium of analysts and investors.Speech recognition must get much better if we are to speak naturally to our gadgets. So the tech industry is vacuuming up all the conversations it can.So Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and China's Baidu have embarked on a world-wide hunt for terabytes of human speech. Microsoft has set up mock apartments in cities around the globe to record volunteers speaking in a home setting. Every hour, Amazon uploads Alexa queries to a vast digital warehouse. Baidu is busily collecting every dialect in China. Then they take all that data and use it to teach their computers how to parse, understand and respond to commands and queries.  The challenge is finding a way to capture natural, real-world conversations. Even 95 percent accuracy isn't enough, says Adam Coates, who runs Baidu's artificial intelligence lab in Sunnyvale, California. \"Our goal is to push the error rate down to 1 percent,\" he says.  \"That's where you can really trust the device to understand what you're saying, and that will be transformative.\" Silicon Valley VCs are growing wary of on-demand delivery: Led by Sequoia and another blue-chip Silicon Valley firm - Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers - venture investors have poured at least $9 billion into 125 on-demand delivery companies over the past decade, including $2.5 billion this year, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available data. But that torrent of money has slowed to a relative trickle in the last half of this year, and many VCs have lost faith in a sector that once seemed like the obvious extension of the success of ride-services juggernauts such as Uber.The bulk of this year's investment - about $1.9 billion - came in the first half of the year. Only $50 million has been invested so far in the fourth quarter, the Reuters analysis found. Several prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists said in interviews that they now believe many delivery startups could fail, leaving investors with big losses. Venky Ganesan, of Menlo Ventures, said the sector has no clear way to cut costs or boost revenue. \"You can’t raise prices on consumers, and you can't cut labor costs,\" he said. \"The core unit economics didn't make sense.\" Dalton Caldwell, a partner at Y Combinator - the prestigious tech incubator that birthed a number of delivery startups - was also skeptical, though he thought companies with top-notch operational capabilities could succeed. Many delivery startups, he said, \"make the assumption that once you get bigger, things will get easier, and that's wrong. There is driver churn, operations people that cost money, more support costs.\"Designing a Safer Battery for Smartphones (That Won’t Catch Fire): Mike Zimmerman likes to shock his guests by using a hammer to drive a nail through a solid polymer lithium metal battery. Nothing happens — and that’s a good thing. Mr. Zimmerman’s battery is a new spin on lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used in products from smartphones to cars. Today’s lithium-ion batteries, as anyone who has followed Samsung’s recent problems with flammable smartphones may know, can be ticking time bombs. The liquids in them can burst into flames if there is a short circuit of some sort. And driving a nail into one of them is definitely not recommended. With that in mind, Mr. Zimmerman’s demonstration commands attention. His Woburn, Mass., start-up, Ionic Materials, is at the cutting edge of an effort to design safer batteries. The company is working on “solid” lithium polymer batteries that greatly reduce their combustible nature.“My dream is to create the holy grail of solid batteries,” Mr. Zimmerman said. After four years of development, he believes he is nearly there and hopes to begin manufacturing within the next two years. Ionic Materials is one of a new wave of academic and commercial research efforts in the United States, Europe and Asia to find safer battery technologies as consumers demand more performance from phones and cars. In the last year, Seeo and Sakti, rival United States solid polymer battery makers, have been acquired by the German industrial firm Bosch and the British vacuum maker Dyson.Bose gets into the hearing aid headphone business: When you’ve got a punny name as good as “Hearphones” (no Google, I did not mean “headphones”) in the chamber, you owe it to the world to deliver product. For Bose, the emerging space of hearing-assisting headphones was the perfect place for that fun bit of word play. The company’s newly unveiled earbuds seem to occupy a similar spot as a number of emerging bits of hardware, including Nuheara’s IQbuds, which we described as a cross between a headphone and a hearing aid when we saw them a while back. Ditto for the Hear One and Sony’s MDR-1000x noise canceling headphones, which were unveiled back at IFA. Bose didn’t do a big announcement this time out, like it did with its new pairs of QuietComforts earlier in the year, instead opting for a soft unveiling, along with some in-person trials, which are running between now and the 15th at its Framingham, Massachusetts headquarters.ESPN, one of Disney’s most popular brands, has investors really worried: ESPN was thrust into the spotlight in November when the ratings company Nielsen predicted the sports juggernaut would lose 621,000 cable subscribers that month. Nielsen estimated the sports network would lose another 555,000 subscribers in December. The staggering losses have led to calls by analysts for Disney to spin off or sell the beleaguered network, which has lost 9 million subscribers in three years, according to company filings. The challenges ahead are not unique to ESPN. The pay-TV industry as a whole has seen may consumers trim back their cable subscriptions in favor of online video services — or, fed up with the rising cost of TV, forgo cable altogether. \"There's an underlying theme of the bundle being the problem,\" said Gene Kimmelman, president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. \"People don't want to pay for what they don't want to get.\" But ESPN remains one of the world's most profitable sports networks, and its struggles raise troubling questions about the entire TV ecosystem. Long considered the linchpin of the traditional bundle, live sports is often what compels viewers to stay with their cable provider rather than cut the cord. But as more consumers defect in the face of growing cable bills, what is happening at ESPN could end up affecting channels up and down the lineup. And for Disney, one of the world's most powerful media companies, the problems at ESPN risk dampening the success of its other brands, such as Star Wars, Marvel Studios and Pixar. ESPN and its siblings, such as ABC, account for the biggest chunk of Disney's business by far, pulling in $24 billion in revenue this fiscal year. The company's next biggest segment, theme parks, made $17 billion.Automaker Honda invests in ride-hailing service Grab: Southeast Asian ride-hailing service Grab said on Monday it had secured an investment from Japanese automaker Honda Motor Co as part of a deal to collaborate on its motorbike-hailing service, in the latest auto industry tie-up of its type. Grab, the biggest rival to ride-sharing service Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] in Southeast Asia, raised $750 million in a funding round in September. A source familiar with the matter said the round valued Grab at more than $3 billion.Andreessen in hot water for texts he sent Zuckerberg: Facebook’s board was sued earlier this year, with investors alleging that their interests were not adequately represented when Zuckerberg was permitted to sell most of his shares and still retain voting control of the company. And now court filings uncovered by Bloomberg show that texts sent by board member Marc Andreessen are being used to suggest that he was protecting Zuckerberg instead of shareholders. Private messages sent during conference calls from Andreessen to Zuckerberg, such as “this line of argument is not helping” and “now we’re cooking with gas,” have given some investors the impression that he was coaching the CEO instead of negotiating with him. The board appointed a committee last year to represent investor concerns because the proposed stock sale could dilute their voting power. Andreessen was on the committee and has been accused of neglecting his fiduciary duties.Inmarsat switches to Arianespace for satellite launch after SpaceX delays: British satellite company Inmarsat will switch to using Arianespace from rival SpaceX to launch a new satellite to provide broadband connectivity to air passengers, it said on Thursday. The S-band satellite had been scheduled to launch with technology billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX but Inmarsat said setbacks to SpaceX's launch schedule prompted it to turn to Arianespace instead. Inmarsat said on Thursday that European-owned Arianespace will launch the S-band satellite in mid-2017. SpaceX has been forced to delay December rocket launches until January as an investigation continues into why one rocket burst into flames on September 1. SpaceX has a backlog of more than 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers, worth more than $10 billion.With LinkedIn, Microsoft Looks to Avoid Past Acquisition Busts: Microsoft announced on Thursday that it had completed its $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, the social network for professionals. There are ample reasons to be skeptical that the deal, the biggest by far in Microsoft’s history, will pay off.  First, the company has not had a great track record with this sort of thing. Two of Microsoft’s largest acquisitions — the digital advertising firm aQuantive and the mobile unit of Nokia — were disappointments that eventually led to the company writing off nearly the entire value of the deals, more than $13 billion in all.  Still, the Microsoft of 2016 is different from the unfocused giant of the past that lurched from deal to deal with wild-eyed ambitions of catching rivals like Google and Apple. It has a new chief executive who has made a series of smaller deals that have shown positive results. The company’s stock is trading at record highs. A key difference in the way Microsoft has approached the deal is the degree of independence it plans to give LinkedIn. It will not weave LinkedIn, which is based in Silicon Valley, into one of its existing product lines, nor will it treat it like a disconnected business. Mr. Weiner will remain LinkedIn’s chief executive. “Neither one of us is a Pollyanna,” said Mr. Weiner. “We both know that acquisition integrations are challenging.” A good model inside Microsoft is the company’s $2.5 billion purchase in 2014 of Mojang, the developer behind Minecraft, which has continued to grow under Microsoft’s ownership, retaining key employees along the way. Mr. Nadella and Mr. Weiner said they had also looked to Facebook’s success in acquiring companies like the photo-sharing service Instagram, while granting them autonomy. “I absolutely think of LinkedIn as our Instagram,” Mr. Nadella said. So determined was Mr. Nadella to get off on the right foot that he emailed an unusual request to Mr. Weiner a few days after the announcement of their deal in June. He asked Mr. Weiner to take the lead on an integration team responsible for merging their two companies, a responsibility that normally falls to an executive at the acquiring company. “I had to read it at least twice,” Mr. Weiner said. “I did a bit of a double take.”Pebble confirms it’s shutting down, devs and software going to Fitbit: RIP Pebble… The wearable maker that pioneered wrist-based notifications before Apple and many others waded into the smartwatch space has confirmed it’s closing its doors as an independent entity. Late last month rumors emerged that Fitbit was set to acquire Pebble — with our sources telling us the price-tag was between $34 million and $40M, a figure they said “barely” covered the startup’s debts. Although the company avoided an explicit confirmation of the rumor by tweeting a shrug emoji until now. So really it sounds like it’s only a matter of time before Pebble wrist-wear reaches the end of the functionality road — with whatever lifespan left now up to Fitbit to determine. Warranty support for Pebble devices has already been withdrawn, according to the blog post. While the Pebble 2, which only started shipping earlier this month, has now been canceled — with no more orders being accepted or fulfilled. Kickstarter backers whose rewards have not yet been fulfilled are slated to get a full refund within 4-8 weeks as a chargeback to their credit cards. Anyone who returned a Pebble device before December 7 will also get a refund, according to the post. In terms of what exactly Fitbit is acquiring, Migicovsky writes that “many” Pebble staff will be joining Fitbit to work on wearable software platforms. The focus of the acquisition looks firmly to be software.Airbnb Turns the Volume Down on Its Fights With Regulators Everywhere: Airbnb has reached that moment in a brash young startup's life where it decides it's in its best interest to acknowledge the existence of rules.Airbnb has always operated under a cloud of legal uncertainty as it battled city governments over how to regulate its network of short-term rental properties. The company has been kicking it into high gear to clear the situation up in recent days. On Wednesday, it released a report laying out its approach to local regulations, trying to capitalize on a weeklong stretch in which it agreed to enforce limits on rentals in London and Amsterdam, dropped a lawsuit against New York City, and praised new rules in New Orleans as a potential nationwide model. The report released today mostly restates the arguments that Airbnb has made in the past. Airbnb acknowledges that rules will vary from city to city. In general, it says it wants to collect taxes, and will help cities enforce limits on how many nights per year people can rent out their homes on the platform. It continues to push back against the idea that hosts should have to register their apartment with city officials, but suggests ways that cities can make the process less onerous. The moves over the last week mark a shift in Airbnb's priorities, putting a stable regulatory landscape ahead of the move-fast-and-break-things approach that got it to this point. It's also a major de-escalation for a company that spent the last several months suing governments in some of its most important markets. At some point it needed to start getting along with regulators in order to prepare for an eventual IPO, although until recently it seemed to be hoping to enjoy the free-for-all for a bit longer.BMW uses remote locking to trap car thief suspect inside stolen vehicle: A suspect in a Seattle car theft had a rude awakening last week when the car he allegedly stole seemed to take on a life of its own. The man accused of stealing a BMW 550i on Nov. 30 found himself trapped inside the stolen car while surrounded by law enforcement officers in Seattle. The car's owner — a newlywed bride who had just tied the knot the day before — had lent her BMW to a friend, according to the Seattle Police Department's blotter. The friend parked the car at the owner's place that night, leaving the key fob inside the vehicle and forgetting to lock the doors. Police said a 38-year-old man  found the  car unlocked and hopped in, taking it for a joy ride before pulling over and falling asleep. The car's owner awoke to find her car missing and notified the police, who contacted BMW's roadside assistance program to help locate the vehicle, the police report said. The man was arrested and charged with auto theft and drug possession due to the small amount of methamphetamine discovered on him, police said. Several automakers — including BMW, Audi and Toyota — offer remote locking and tracking in their vehicles. It is frequently cited as a safety feature should a car be stolen.SoftBank CEO Tells Trump He’ll Invest $50 Billion in Startup: SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son told President-elect Donald Trump he would create 50,000 new jobs in the U.S. through a $50 billion investment in startups and new companies. The money will come from SoftBank’s previously announced $100 billion technology fund, according to a person familiar with the matter. That investment vehicle has a $45 billion commitment from the government of Saudi Arabia and $25 billion from Tokyo-based SoftBank, which operates technology and wireless companies around the world. The pledge helps SoftBank, which controls U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp., get off to a good start with Trump after failing to win the Obama administration’s backing for a plan to consolidate the mobile-phone market. SoftBank shares rose as much as 5.1 percent to 7,311 yen in early trading in Tokyo, their highest since August 2015.Google Looks for 'Conservative Outreach' Manager After Trump Election Win: The Alphabet Inc. unit posted a job listing for a manager of \"conservative outreach\" on its policy team 10 days after the election. The company is searching for a Washington veteran to \"tell Google’s story in an elevator or from a podium,\" according to the description on Google's career website.  \"As a member of Google's Public Policy outreach team, you will act as Google’s liaison to conservative, libertarian and free market groups,\" the listing reads. \"You are part organizer, part advocate and part policy wonk as you understand the world of third-party non-governmental advocacy organizations.\" Although Google eschewed lobbying in its early years, it has turned into one of the largest corporate forces in Washington. Alphabet has spent $11.9 million so far this year, ranking it in the top five among U.S. companies, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.  Its top lobbyist is Susan Molinari, a former Republican Congresswoman from New York. Her father, Guy Molinari, a luminary in the state's party, spoke out against Trump in 2015. In September, he told a New York City newspaper he was reversing his position and endorsing the party's nominee.Meitu of China, Built on the Selfie, Could Be Worth $5.23 Billion in I.P.O.: For users of Meitu’s signature app, a beautiful touch-up at the press of a button is free. But Meitu is hoping that investors in the company, which wants to “make the world a more beautiful place,” will value it somewhere between $4.6 billion and $5.23 billion. Meitu plans to offer shares at between 8.5 Hong Kong dollars and 9.6 Hong Kong dollars, raising $629 million to $710 million. The company is known for its eponymous selfie app, which allows users to digitally alter their photos, as well as its livestreaming app, Meipai. It also makes smartphones, designed to improve selfie-taking, which are endorsed by the Chinese actress Angelababy. The share listing will offer a rare gauge of whether global investors agree with the sky-high valuations often found in China’s tech start-up scene. Venture capitalists and private investors have leapt into the field, which has given rise to successful app- and gadget-makers amid an e-commerce and financial technology boom.Psst.. Sony Has a Hit That's as Big as Pokemon Go in Japan: Nintendo Co. might have scored a hit with the explosive debut of Pokemon Go this year. On its home turf, however, Sony Corp. has quietly dispatched its rival with a popular mobile game called Fate/Grand Order. The game, based on an anime TV series called Fate, allows players to travel back in time and team up with historical figures like Julius Caesar, Leonardo da Vinci and Joan of Arc to rescue humanity from looming disaster. While the basic version is free to play, people can pay for tokens that make it easier to add characters and speed up gameplay. Fate/Grand Order has been at or near the top of Japan's app revenue rankings all year and has been downloaded more than 7 million times since its July 2015 debut. It has made more money than Pokemon Go among Android users 104 out of 133 days this year, and 51 days on iOS devices, in the same period, according to researcher App Annie. The game's success is a sign of how important Sony's gaming and entertainment businesses are as the company struggles with razor-thin margins and competition in televisions, cameras and other hardware. The company plans to expand its mobile games effort with more titles in more markets in the coming months.Snapchat’s camcorder goggles are creepy cool and kind of brilliant: Snapchat’s first hardware product is a pair of $130 sunglasses that shoot first-person bursts of circular, wide-angle video. The Spectacles, as they’re called, are designed to make it easy to record what you’re actually seeing, in the moment, without having to awkwardly fish your giant smartphone out of your pocket and hold it in front of your face. The resulting recording is intended to be more lifelike, too.the last big camera-goggles launch, Google Glass, went about as poorly as possible. Glass, a too-serious attempt to put a computer on your face, looked ridiculous in a bad-taste, cyborg way. It introduced a creepy privacy violation — a face-mounted camera that you, as a bystander, couldn’t control — with poor explanation. Its early adopters, “Explorers” who spent $1,500 for the privilege, were derided as “Glassholes,” widely mocked, and sometimes abused. The whole thing came across as a poorly planned embarrassment. Spiegel is obviously trying to avoid these problems. Strategically, though, Spectacles are potentially brilliant. If Spectacles can intercept the smartphone camera and become the creative device that people use for any decent amount of recording — in what seems to be a proprietary format, with a custom-designed distribution network in Snapchat — that’s a pretty awesome position to be in.Apple Inc. has acquired Indian machine-learning startup Tuplejump  as it seeks to expand its expertise in artificial intelligence. The iPhone maker bought the Hyderabad, India-based company in June, according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified. Tuplejump’s software specializes in processing and analyzing big sets of data quickly. The deal was reported earlier by TechCrunch. The purchase price wasn’t disclosed. Tuplejump has about a dozen employees, many of whom were already based on the west coast of the U.S., the person said. Founder Rohit Rai’s LinkedIn profile says he started working for Apple in May and is now also based in Seattle.Yahoo has confirmed a data breach with 500 million accounts stolen, as questions about disclosure to Verizon and users grow: Yahoo confirmed today that it had been subject of a massive hacking attack that exposed the data of at least 500 million users. Recode previously reported that Yahoo was about to reveal the breach and Yahoo had declined to comment when contacted last night. Now, the company is unveiling a situation much worse than expected, although the Recode report noted that it would be. Earlier this summer, Yahoo said it was investigating a data breach in which hackers claimed to have access to 200 million user accounts and one was selling them online. “It’s as bad as that,” said one source. “Worse, really.” The announcement has huge implications on Yahoo’s pending deal to be bought by Verizon for $4.8 billion. Sources at Verizon said they were largely unaware of the severity of the attack until recently and that CEO Marissa Mayer and others did not flag them as to the extent of the issue in the bidding process. You can read that ire clearly between the lines in a statement from Verizon-owned AOL, which is expected to be integrated with Yahoo when the deal is complete. \"Within the last two days, we were notified of Yahoo's security incident. We understand that Yahoo is conducting an active investigation of this matter, but we otherwise have limited information and understanding of the impact. We will evaluate as the investigation continues through the lens of overall Verizon interests, including consumers, customers, shareholders and related communities. Until then, we are not in position to further comment.\" In addition, internal sources at Yahoo said the company had been subjected to a number of previous incidents that were not managed swiftly by CEO Marissa Mayer. One executive close to the situation said that former Yahoo information security head Alex Stamos had tried aggressively to get management to act more strongly at the time, but he had not been successful. The well-regarded techie left Yahoo in mid-2015 for a job as chief security officer at Facebook. This whole incident was first revealed in August when “Peace,” an infamous cybercriminal, advertised the sale of user credentials for some 200 million Yahoo users on the “dark web.” The data included user names, some passwords and personal information like birth dates and other email addresses. At the time, Yahoo said it was “aware of the claim,” but declined to say if it was legitimate. Instead, it opened an investigation, but did not issue a call for a password reset to users.Uber rival Grab partners with driverless car firm in Singapore: Users of ride-hailing firm Grab will be able to book driverless cars from Friday as it partners with a start-up testing the technology in Singapore, just days after rival Uber debuted its self-driving vehicles in the United States. The move comes as technology companies and automakers race to build autonomous vehicles and develop new business plans for what is expected to be a long-term makeover of personal transportation. Southeast Asia's Grab said its app will allow select commuters to book and ride start-up nuTonomy's driverless vehicles within a western Singapore district, where the vehicles are being tested, and adjacent neighborhoods. A safety driver and support engineer will ride in each nuTonomy car, the two companies said in a statement. nuTonomy, which started a limited public trial of the first driverless taxi in August in Singapore, has said it hopes to have 100 taxis working commercially in the city-state by 2018. Countries around the world are encouraging the development of autonomous technologies, and Singapore, with its limited land and workforce, is hoping driverless vehicles will encourage its residents to use more shared vehicles and public transport. Grab said its data showed drivers in Singapore are less likely to accept a passenger booking request originating from or destined for remote locations, highlighting the need for \"robo-cars\" that can meet transportation needs in far-flung areas. If a trip requires travel on roads outside of Singapore's one-north district, the safety driver will take control of the vehicle for that portion of the trip.Apple is reportedly in talks to buy automaker McLaren: The auto industry and the tech world may about to get a new power player: Apple is reportedly in talks to buy the high-performance car company McLaren, according to the Financial Times. The two firms have been talking for several months about plans to have Apple make a strategic investment in the McLaren Technology Group or buy it outright, the article said, citing \"three people briefed on the negotiations.\" Many Apple watchers have advocated for Apple to buy Tesla, but Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has called such a deal \"unlikely.\" Musk has also scorned Apple's car efforts, telling a German newspaper that he refers to Apple as \"Tesla graveyard\" because the tech firm hires so many engineers that Tesla has let go. But Apple could be very attractive for McLaren, which has struggled to reach profitability. The British carmaker may be best known for its very high-end luxury supercars and its Formula One team, though it also has made forays into wearable technology, health care and electronics. It took the name McLaren Technology Group in 2015 to reflect its diversification strategy. The focus on technology could represent a good culture alignment for Apple and McLaren, although  McLaren is a much smaller manufacturer than could serve Apple's massive customer base. The firm said at the time of its renaming that it produces just more than 1,600 cars per year.Researchers remotely hack Tesla Model S: Chinese researchers announced Monday that they had discovered security vulnerabilities in the Tesla Model S that allowed them to take over the vehicle’s brakes and more without laying a finger on the car. While other researchers have hacked into Tesla vehicles, this appears to be the first time researchers were able to do so remotely — highlighting the security risks of the sophisticated software and online features now being built into vehicles. A video posted by the researchers from Tencent’s Keen Security Lab appears to show them controlling the vehicle's brakes, as well as manipulating its side mirrors, running the windshield wipers and popping the trunk while the car is in motion. The researchers were also able to manipulate some other features while the vehicle was parked, including opening the sunroof, controlling some of the vehicle’s lights and unlocking the doors, according to the video. In a blog post, the researchers wrote that they reported the vulnerabilities to Tesla, and the company confirmed the hack. The researchers only tested out their method on “multiple varieties of Tesla Model S,” but said that it’s “reasonable to assume that other Tesla models are affected.\" Tesla said in an emailed statement that it \"deployed an over-the-air software update\" to fix the problem within 10 days of being informed about the bug. The company said the vulnerabilities that Keen Security Lab uncovered would only be accessible under a very specific circumstance: when the vehicle’s Web browser was in use and the car was connected to a malicious WiFi hotspot. Tesla plans to reward the researchers under its bug bounty program, according to the statement. Tesla was the first automaker to roll out such a program, which offers cash rewards to independent researchers who help the company uncover problems in its software. The company pays up to $10,000 per bug.iPhone 7 Teardown Shows Margins Slimming on Storage, Displays: Apple Inc.’s iPhone margins have narrowed with the release of its latest smartphone line, the iPhone 7, with higher costs to provide greater storage options, a glossy black cover and more advanced displays, according to an analysis by IHS Inc. The component analysis firm estimates that the total manufacturing cost of an entry-level iPhone 7, a model with a 4.7-inch screen and 32 GB of storage, is $224.80. This compares with an updated IHS estimate of $200 for an entry-level iPhone 6S in 2015. IHS didn’t perform an analysis of the larger iPhone 7 Plus but said the costs are likely higher than last year’s iPhone 6S Plus due to the presence of additional components. Based on the IHS breakdown, the margins on the 4.7-inch iPhones have narrowed as Apple maintained the $649 starting price, but the company seems to have offset this by raising the price of the iPhone 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 Plus costs $769 for a model with 32 GB of storage compared with last year’s $749 entry-level price. Apple is also holding up its overall margins by reserving the more costly glossy black manufacturing process for the 128 GB and 256 GB models. While Apple hasn’t released sales numbers for the iPhone 7 line’s opening weekend, the company indicated its initial supply sold out. Despite early knocks against the device for its lack of a headphone jack, reviews have been positive and the company’s stock has gained 5.4 percent since the new phone was introduced about two weeks ago. The iPhone represented about 66 percent of Apple’s revenue last year, and the product’s unit sales, margins, and average-sales-price are critical to the company’s quarterly earnings results.Ride-hailing app Grab raises $750 million in funding led by SoftBank: Southeast Asian ride-hailing firm Grab said it raised $750 million in a funding round led by investor SoftBank Group, adding that it would continue expanding in the region and also significantly invest in mobile payments capabilities. Southeast Asia is fast becoming a key battleground for ride-hailing firms thanks to a burgeoning middle class as well as a youthful, Internet-savvy demographic. Grab's announcement comes a few weeks after Uber sold its China operations to bigger domestic rival Didi and analysts have said Uber may focus its efforts and money elsewhere, such as in Southeast Asia.Twitter to lay off less than 20 employees at India center: source: Twitter Inc said on Monday it would lay off some employees and halt engineering work at one of its development centers in India's technology hub Bengaluru. The layoffs will impact less than 20 employees at the development center, according to a source familiar with the matter. The employees were part of ZipDial, an Indian mobile communications startup bought by Twitter last year, the source said.\"Over the past 18 months, we have incorporated the technology and talent of our ZipDial acquisition across our company,\" said a company spokesperson. Twitter said it remained committed to India as a strategic market and would continue to maintain a presence in the city. The company had 3,860 employees globally as of June 2016. However, it did not disclose the number of employees it had in India.Why did Postmates hire Silicon Valley’s most famous bankers only to raise cash from its existing investors? Back in March, Recode reported that delivery startup Postmates had hired Qatalyst, the famed Silicon Valley investment bank known for helping internet companies find acquirers. But six months later, Postmates still hasn’t been sold. Instead, Postmates will likely raise an investment of at least $100 million, TechCrunch first reported and Recode has confirmed. What is weird, however, is where Postmates’ new money is coming from: Its existing investors, led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, instead of a new investor Qatalyst was hired to find (if it was going to be an investment and not a sale). Huh? Let’s back up and replay this sequence of events to see if we can find the logic. First, Postmates hires Qatalyst to help it explore selling the company or raising money from new investors. Qatalyst bankers go out and talk to a bunch of would-be acquirers and would-be investors but don’t find a deal. So Postmates’ current investors decide to pony up a bunch of new money instead because, really, what is the alternative when you’re backing a fast-growing but money-losing company that you think may still have home-run potential? This means one of the following scenarios is true. Either A) Postmates thinks its business is more attractive than would-be acquirers or new investors do, or B) Qatalyst didn’t do its job well, or C) both of the above. AngelList Braces for Rainy Days as Startup Seed Funding Falls: AngelList is preparing for winter. The company, which runs an online portal connecting entrepreneurs with private investors, is assembling a “rainy day” fund and exploring new businesses as the market for investing in young startups slows. Naval Ravikant, the chief executive officer and co-founder of the San Francisco startup, said he’s looking outside Silicon Valley to keep the money flowing in a downturn. He aims to secure commitments from sovereign-wealth funds, endowments and other investors around the world to invest $1 billion through AngelList in the coming years. Last year, China’s CSC Venture Capital, the U.S. arm of private-equity firm China Science & Merchants Investment Management Group, committed $400 million, he said. “If there’s a cash crunch and valuations come down drastically, then that’s when you want to be investing,” said Ravikant, a prolific seed investor who made early bets on Uber Technologies Inc. and Twitter Inc. “That’s what raising this institutional money is about. It’s our rainy day money.”  The rapid rise of AngelList coincided with a startup boom. The website has facilitated seed investments by mainly wealthy Americans in more than 1,000 startups, as well as funding for some later-stage companies, including Cruise Automation and Dollar Shave Club, which were each acquired this year. AngelList typically takes a 5 percent cut of the profit from each investment made through its platform, which it collects once a startup gets bought or goes public. It also plays the role of investor—through a $20 million fund, which it recently exhausted, and a newer $35 million fund.Want to Find Fulfillment at Last? Think Like a Designer: You’re going to learn how to find a fulfilling career. You’re going to learn how to better navigate life’s big-moment decisions and kill your “wicked problems” dead. How? By training yourself to think like a designer. That, anyway, is the premise of “Designing Your Life,” a class taught at Stanford University (the school’s “most popular class,” according to Fast Company magazine) as well as the just-published book that grew out of it, “Designing Your Life: How to Build a Well-Lived, Joyful Life” (Knopf). The two men who created the class and wrote the book are Silicon Valley veterans, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. They believe they have hit upon a system to help you deal with almost any challenge. But everything else? The two professors claim that you can design an amazing life in the same way that Jonathan Ive designed the iPhone. They say the practices taught in the class and the book can help you (in designing-your-life-speak) “reframe” dysfunctional beliefs that surround life and career decisions and help you “wayfind” in a chaotic world through the adoption of such design tenets as bias-for-action, prototyping and team-building. After nine years of teaching their secrets to future Google product managers and start-up wunderkinds, Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans are opening up the curriculum to everyone. “What do I want to be when I grow up?” and “Am I living a meaningful life?” aren’t only subjects for late-night pot-fueled dorm hangouts, the men said.The book includes things that are not in the class, like what Mr. Burnett and Mr. Evans call “anchor problems” — overcommitted life choices that keep people stuck and unhappy. A common mistake that people make, they said, is to assume that there’s only one right solution or optimal version of your life, and that if you choose wrong, you’ve blown it.Jessica Alba’s Honest Company has been in talks to sell to a big consumer product giant: Honest Company, the diaper and personal care product company co-founded by the actress Jessica Alba, has been in talks to sell the company, several sources close to the situation said. Sources indicated that the buyer is likely to be a big consumer product company like Procter & Gamble or Unilever. As in all acquisition talks, the discussions may not result in a deal, and a potential acquisition price is not known. But Honest Company was most recently valued at around $1.7 billion when it raised $100 million in financing last year. The five-year-old company has raised $222 million in investments overall and brought in revenue of around $300 million in 2015, according to one source. The talks come as consumer-packaged goods companies are grappling with the increasing importance of e-commerce to their future and the challenge of competing in this new world without relying too heavily on sales through Amazon. Traditional retailers are facing similar challenges, as displayed by Walmart’s planned $3.3 billion purchase of Jet.com, a shopping site that’s only one year old. Along the way, the consumer packaged goods giants have become intrigued by startup brands like Dollar Shave Club and Honest that have built large followings by selling consumer goods directly to customers through their own websites and not through Amazon. In a surprise purchase, Unilever bought Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion earlier this summer.Apple will not give first-weekend sales of iPhone 7, the company said on Thursday, making it harder for analysts to get a read on the product's prospects amid questions over whether its popularity has peaked. The company decided to stop the practice because the number of phones sold during the period has become more a reflection of Apple’s supply than demand, a company spokeswoman said, when asked whether Apple will be releasing the figure.The stakes for the iPhone 7 are high after sales of the gadget dropped during two straight quarters this year, the first declines in its history. As they try to assess whether the iPhone has reached a plateau, investors will not be happy about losing a data point, said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. \"Less data is never good, particularly given the question marks around this phone,\" he said. Apple shares fell 2.4 percent to $105.71 in mid-day trading.What’s Really Missing From the New iPhone: Dazzle Forget about the headphone jack for a second. Sure, it’s pretty annoying that Apple’s newest iPhones — the 7 and 7 Plus, which were unveiled in San Francisco on Wednesday and will start shipping to customers on Sept. 16 — will not include a port for plugging in standard earbuds. But you’ll get used to it. The absence of a jack is far from the worst shortcoming in Apple’s latest product launch. Instead, it’s a symptom of a deeper issue with the new iPhones, part of a problem that afflicts much of the company’s product lineup: Apple’s aesthetics have grown stale. Apple has squandered its once-commanding lead in hardware and software design. Though the new iPhones include several new features, including water resistance and upgraded cameras, they look pretty much the same as the old ones. The new Apple Watch does too. And as competitors have borrowed and even begun to surpass Apple’s best designs, what was iconic about the company’s phones, computers, tablets and other products has come to seem generic. This is a subjective assessment, and it’s one that Apple rebuts.Yet there are signs that my critique of Apple’s designs are shared by others. Industrial designers and tech critics used to swoon over Apple’s latest hardware; nowadays you witness less swooning and more bemusement.And while Apple has slowed its design cadence, its rivals have sped up. Last year Samsung remade its lineup of Galaxy smartphones in a new glass-and-metal design that looked practically identical to the iPhone. Then it went further. Over the course of a few months, Samsung put out several design refinements, culminating in the Note 7, a big phone that has been universally praised by critics. With its curved sides and edge-to-edge display, the Note 7 pulls off a neat trick: Though it is physically smaller than Apple’s big phone, it actually has a larger screen. So thanks to clever design, you get more from a smaller thing — exactly the sort of advance we once looked to Apple for.OfferUp raises $119 million for resale marketplace: It’s like Craigslist, but with auctions. OfferUp is an app that makes it easy to buy and sell your goods. The fast-growing Seattle-based company is raising $119 million to continue its global expansion and continue hiring. The round is led by Warburg Pincus and includes funding from GGV Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and T. Rowe Price. OfferUp users snap a photo of their used items like clothing and furniture and then check the app to sort through the highest bids. The built-in messaging feature also makes it easy to communicate with prospective buyers. Hans Tung from GGV Capital said that he invested in OfferUp because “Craigslist hasn’t innovated for a long time and there is unmet, pent up demand for classified on mobile.” He points out that OfferUp makes it easy to communicate with prospective buyers, without having to share one’s personal cell phone number. OfferUp launched just last year and already has 29 million installations in the U.S. They claim that their user engagement rivals Snapchats.I personally tried OfferUp last fall when I was selling items before a cross-country move. I was surprised to see how easy it was to find bidders for seemingly undesirable things, including my used trash can! OfferUp previously raised over $91 million in funding. Postmates is raising at least $100 million to fuel its on-demand ambitions: We’re hearing from sources that Postmates, which is among a few companies that are seen as operating in the difficult on-demand space, is raising at least $100 million in a round led by Founders Fund. Sources stressed that the round has not closed, and that things may change over time. Despite the challenges of working in an on-demand economy — which can sometimes lead to punishing gross margins and high operational costs — we’ve heard that Postmates is actually in okay shape. Some leaked financial documents earlier obtained by TechCrunch dated last year highlighted gross margins of around 20%. Postmates’ CEO Bastian Lehmann has said before that the company is on track to hit profitability in 2017 — which, at the time we reviewed the leaked documents, we also heard was on track.The company is operating in an area of steep competition with the likes of DoorDash, which recently raised $127 million in a down round. That moment was somewhat of a microcosm of the financing environment at the time: DoorDash sought a valuation of $1 billion, but inevitably had to settle for something lower. However, in Postmates’ situation, we hear that this round is not a down round. The company last raised $80 million at a round that valued it at nearly $500 million. Obviously this is good news for Postmates.A look at three players in the 3D printing world: Carbon is backed by notable investors, including Google, Autodesk and Sequoia Capital as the company managed to raise $141 million to date. Their debut printer, the M1, is priced at $40,000 per year with a minimum three-year term — a subscription-based model that is quite new to the 3D printing industry. After a decade’s worth of research and development, and $25 million in funding from Autodesk and Catalyst, XJet revealed its technology at RAPID 2016 in May. The company now has seven machines operating in its Rehovot, Israel HQ, but is yet to announce an official launch date and its first product. Once on the market, XJet could potentially disrupt the production of short-runs of complex metal parts in major areas of production.Offering an end-to-end solution for $155,000, HP’s machine is priced rather competitively. Currently there’s only one available material (nylon), but the company is planning to roll out more materials in the coming months, showing vast potential for future development.How Uber Drivers Decide How Long to Work: For nearly 20 years, economists have been debating how cabdrivers decide when to call it a day. This may seem like a trivial question, but it is one that cuts to the heart of whether humans are fundamentally rational — in this case, whether they earn their incomes efficiently — as the discipline has traditionally assumed. In one camp is a group of so-called behavioral economists who have found evidence that many taxi drivers work longer hours on days when business is slow and shorter hours when business is brisk — the opposite of what economic rationality, to say nothing of common sense, would seem to dictate. So who is right? That’s where Uber comes in. When one of the company’s researchers, using its supremely detailed data on drivers’ work time and rides, waded into the debate with a paper this year, the results were intriguing. Over all, there was little evidence that drivers were driving less when they could make more per hour than usual. But that was not true for a large portion of new drivers. Many of these drivers appeared to have an income goal in mind and stopped when they were near it, causing them to knock off sooner when their hourly wage was high and to work longer when their wage was low.Whatever the case, the result seems to have one very obvious implication: Anyone trying to make it in the gig economy should probably pick a favorite platform or two and stick with them rather than constantly jump around from one type of gig to another.Goodbye, Ivory Tower. Hello, Silicon Valley Candy Store. Silicon Valley is turning to the dismal science in its never-ending quest to squeeze more money out of old markets and build new ones. In turn, the economists say they are eager to explore the digital world for fresh insights into timeless economic questions of pricing, incentives and behavior. “It’s an absolute candy store for economists,” Mr. Coles said. The pay, of course, is a lot better than you would find in academia, where economists typically earn $125,000 to $150,000 a year. In tech companies, pay for a Ph.D. economist will usually come in at more than $200,000 a year, the companies say. With bonuses and stock grants, compensation can easily double in a few years. Senior economists who manage teams can make even more. Businesses have been hiring economists for years. Usually, they are asked to study macroeconomic trends — topics like recessions and currency exchange rates — and help their employers deal with them. But what the tech economists are doing is different: Instead of thinking about national or global trends, they are studying the data trails of consumer behavior to help digital companies make smart decisions that strengthen their online marketplaces in areas like advertising, movies, music, travel and lodging. Tech outfits including giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoftand up-and-comers like Airbnb and Uber hope that sort of improved efficiency means more profit.Satellite owner says SpaceX owes $50 million or free flight: Israel's Space Communication Ltd said on Sunday it could seek $50 million or a free flight from Elon Musk's SpaceX after a Spacecom communications satellite was destroyed last week by an explosion at SpaceX's Florida launch site. Officials of the Israeli company said in a conference call with reporters Sunday that Spacecom also could collect $205 million from Israel Aerospace Industries, which built the AMOS-6 satellite. SpaceX said in an email to Reuters that it does not disclose contract or insurance terms. The company is not public, and it has not said what insurance it had for the rocket or to cover launch pad damages beyond what was required by the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees commercial U.S. launches, for liability and damage to government property. SpaceX has more than 70 missions on its manifest, worth more than $10 billion, for commercial and government customers. The space launch company is one of three major transportation and energy enterprises Musk leads. The others are electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc and SolarCity Corp, and Musk faces separate challenges at each of those money losing companies. Spacecom has been hit hard in the aftermath of the Thursday explosion that destroyed the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and its payload. The Israeli company said the loss of the satellite would have a significant impact, with its equity expected to decline by $30 million to $123 million. Spacecom shares dropped 9 percent on Thursday, with the explosion occurring late in the last trading day of the week.SpaceX Rocket Explodes at Launchpad in Cape Canaveral - Destroying Facebook Satellite: A spectacular explosion of a SpaceX rocket on Thursday destroyed a $200 million communications satellite that would have extended Facebook’s reach across Africa, dealing a serious setback to Elon Musk, the billionaire who runs the rocket company. The blast is likely to disrupt NASA’s cargo deliveries to the International Space Station, exposing the risks of the agency’s growing reliance on private companies like SpaceX to carry materials and, soon, astronauts. The explosion, at Cape Canaveral, Fla., intensified questions about whether Mr. Musk is moving too quickly in his headlong investment in some of the biggest and most complex industries, not just space travel but carmakers and electric utilities. This is not the first problem Mr. Musk has suffered as he tries to create space travel that is cheap and commonplace. Each of his companies, including Tesla and SolarCity, has hit major stumbling blocks recently. Theowner of a Tesla car died in May in a crash using the company’s autopilot software, and SolarCity faces major financial challenges. The explosion was particularly painful news for Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who is touring Kenya, promoting a program reliant on the satellite, known as Amos-6, with entrepreneurs in the country. He had promised them connectivity. Just hours after the news of the explosion broke, Mr. Zuckerberg expressed disappointment on his Facebook page “that SpaceX’s launch failure destroyed our satellite,” a swipe at Mr. Musk and his team, who were still trying to figure out what went wrong.Google shelves plan for phone with interchangeable parts - sources: Alphabet Inc’s Google has suspended Project Ara, its ambitious effort to build what is known as a modular smartphone with interchangeable components, as part of a broader push to streamline the company's hardware efforts, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The move marks an about-face for the tech company, which announced a host of partners for Project Ara at its developer conference in May and said it would ship a developer edition of the product this autumn. The company’s aim was to create a phone that users could customize on the fly with an extra battery, camera, speakers or other components.Axing Project Ara is one of the first steps in a campaign to unify Google’s various hardware efforts, which range from Chromebook laptops to Nexus phones. Former Motorola president Rick Osterloh rejoined Google earlier this year to oversee the effort. Google sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo Group in 2014.“This was a science experiment that failed, and they are moving on,” he said. Project Ara was one of the flagship efforts of Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects group, which aims to develop new devices, but it had various stops and starts. Last year, the company shelved plans to sell the modular phone in Puerto Rico with Latin American carriers.When Things Go Very Wrong at a Start-Up: For many young engineers and business people, Silicon Valley is their version of Hollywood. If you want to make it big, go there, create your own company or sign on with a start-up on the way up, and get ready to make a fortune. Maybe you will even become famous. But Hollywood, it turns out, is not the only California destination with a boulevard of broken dreams. Last week, a Medium post about how things went south — badly — at an unnamed tech start-up drew attention to a side of Silicon Valley not many people talk about. For all the Googles and Facebooks and Oracles, there may be hundreds of companies that never make it. And in some cases, the employees who sign on may walk away poorer financially for their effort. As Katie Benner writes, it wasn’t long before online commenters figured out that the company in the Medium post was called WrkRiot. The unraveling of this company is, of course, a cautionary tale about the many things that can go wrong at a start-up, like questionable bosses and plain old bad ideas. Is it indicative of a larger problem in Silicon Valley? Industry veterans would probably say no. Some people view working for a dud of a start-up as a rite of passage — like a bad relationship that teaches you a lesson about what to avoid in a partner. Others figure that even if things go bad, there are so many good jobs in the area, you won’t be down on your luck for long. But just in case, do a little extra homework before you move across the country to take a start-up job.EU hits Apple with $14.5 billion Irish tax demand: The European Commission ordered Apple Inc to pay Ireland unpaid taxes of up to 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) on Tuesday as it ruled the firm had received illegal state aid. Apple and Dublin said the U.S. company's tax treatment was in line with Irish and European Union law and they would appeal the ruling, which is part of a drive against what the EU says are sweetheart tax deals that usually smaller states in the bloc offer multinational companies to lure jobs and investment. Analysts said the size of the claim underlined the Commission's aggressive stance, but since each case involves different circumstances and tax rules, lawyers said it was hard to see if further big claims were any more or less likely. Apple, which had more than $200 billion in cash and readily marketable securities at the end of June, is likely to see the case drag out for years in EU and possibly Irish courts. Apple warned investors in a July regulatory filing that the Commission's investigation could lead to \"material\" liability for further tax payments, but that it could not estimate the impact. On Tuesday the company said it expects to place \"some amount of cash\" in an escrow account. Tax experts say the European Commission faces a tough battle to convince courts to back up its stand. While the EU has found that certain tax regulations are anti-competitive, it has never before ruled whether countries have applied tax regulations fairly in the way it has with Apple, Starbucks and others. As a result, some lawyers and accountants said they doubted Apple would end up paying back any tax.A few dozen Nest Labs employees just headed to Google; here’s why: Nest Labs, the maker of smart thermostats and smoke detectors, is parting ways with a few dozen employees who work on its Internet of Things platform. According to a Fortunereport that we’ve independently confirmed, those employees are joining Google per a restructuring. Both companies are subsidiaries of parent company Alphabet. The move would seem to make sense. Like Nest, Google has delved into the business of the connected home, including with its OnHub wireless router and Google Home, a portable speaker that’s powered by voice assistance technology and will take direct aim at Amazon’s popular Echo product once it ships later this year. Nest’s thermometers and cameras promise to communicate with Google Home. Nest employs roughly 1,000 people, including in engineering, product marketing and product management. Though its platform team was responsible for building out Nest’s APIs (so Nest products can communicate with other devices), as well as Nest’s Weave protocol (which allows Nest devices to communicate with each other), Nest will continue to build and develop software around its app, site and other services.Alphabet’s Legal Chief Steps Down From Uber Board: David Drummond, the chief legal officer at Alphabet Inc., has stepped down from Uber Technologies Inc.’s board of directors as the two companies move further into each other’s territories. Drummond joined the board in 2013 when GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet formerly known as Google Ventures, led a $258 million round of financing for Uber. It remains GV’s largest investment, and the two companies worked together on projects, including the ability to call a car through Google Maps. However, relations between Alphabet’s Google unit and Uber have become strained in recent years. Bloomberg reported last year that Google had been working on a ride-hailing service using self-driving cars. Uber acquired Otto, an autonomous driving startup staffed by former Google employees, and is working with Volvo on driverless vehicles of its own, which the companies expect to begin rolling out in Pittsburgh this month. Uber has been developing its own mapping operation and is shooting street photography to create an alternative to Google’s map data. EU to hand Apple Irish tax bill of $1.1 billion, source says: The European Commission will rule against Ireland's tax dealings with Apple (AAPL.O) on Tuesday, two source familiar with the decision told Reuters, one of whom said Dublin would be told to recoup over 1 billion euros in back taxes. The European Commission accused Ireland in 2014 of dodging international tax rules by letting Apple shelter profits worth tens of billions of dollars from tax collectors in return for maintaining jobs. Apple and Ireland rejected the accusation; both have said they will appeal any adverse ruling. The source said the Commission will recommend a figure in back taxes that it expects to be collected, but it will be up to Irish authorities to calculate exactly what is owed. A bill in excess of 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion) would be far more than the 30 million euros each the European Commission previously ordered Dutch authorities to recover from U.S. coffee chain Starbucks (SBUX.O) and Luxembourg from Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) for their tax deals. Apple employs 5,500 workers, or about a quarter of its European-based staff in the Irish city of Cork, where it is the largest private sector employer. It has said it paid Ireland's 12.5 percent rate on all the income that it generates in the country. Ireland's low corporate tax rate has been a cornerstone of economic policy for 20 years, drawing investors from major multinational companies whose staff account for almost one in 10 workers in Ireland. Some opposition Irish lawmakers have urged Dublin to collect whatever tax the Commission orders it to. But the main opposition party Fianna Fail, whose support the minority administration relies on to pass laws, said it would support an appeal based on the reassurances it had been given by the government to date.You earn a million dollars a year and can’t get funded? If you’re in the position of struggling to raise funds, here are some reasons why your pitch may not be resonating. You paid $1.2 million to make $1 million: The most common case of seemingly successful businesses struggling to raise funding is when they are paying $1.2 million to generate $1 million. Or, it’s not clear how you’ll turn $1 million into $10 million: We seriously don’t expect every company to be a billion-dollar business. Our model works with $50 million and $100 million exits, but if you’re going to raise venture capital, youshould also be able to explain how you’ll achieve step-function growth — convincingly. A hockey-stick growth path to a billion dollar valuation isn’t required; it can be as simple as taking revenue from $1 million to $10 million. So… If you’ve built a million-dollar business and are struggling to convince VCs, we’d love to talk to you! Just know that when you’re pitching investors, not all revenue is valued equally, and it’s just one factor among many that investors will use to evaluate your business. Bryce Roberts put it well when he tweeted “Not all good businesses are good investments. Not all good investments are good businesses.” Your favorite neighborhood restaurant might generate a million dollars a year in revenue, but it would be a bad bet for VCs. Facebook lost money for years before going on to dominate global communication. If youdecide you want to play the VC game, just be sure to learn how the score is tallied.China’s Murky World Where E-Commerce Meets Student Lending: Across college campuses in China, a small army of marketers is recruiting students to borrow money at interest rates many times that charged by the nation’s banks. Those without a credit history or parental approval can borrow money to buy a smartphone, pay for holidays, or get the latest sneakers through a raft of apps such as Fenqile. The market leader, whose name literally means Happy Installment Payments, has 50,000 part-time marketers across more than 3,000 universities and proudly touts the slogan “Wait no more; love what I love.” Welcome to the regulatory gray area where peer-to-peer lending meets e-commerce in China. In the last three years, tens of millions of students have taken out micro-loans with the tap of a button to buy things. Once just the realm of startups, the sector has attracted heavy hitters in China’s online industry, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s finance affiliate and JD.com Inc., which are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the lending model. In a nation with 37 million college students, the market is expected to reach $15 billion, according to the Beijing-based market research firm Analysys. The apps sell everything from cameras to concert tickets sourced from third-parties, charging students annualized interest rates typically above 10 percent. The loans are then packaged and sold to wealthy individuals, who find the expected return of as much as 10 percent much more attractive than the central bank’s benchmark savings rate of 1.75 percent.How long before Amazon forces its Indian rivals into a merger or sale? Three years into Amazon’s aggressive push in India, the country’s two home-grown e-commerce competitors are feeling the pressure. Both Flipkart and Snapdeal have raised more than a billion dollars, but have historically recorded big losses as they’ve engaged in discounting battles with each other and with Amazon. Amazon has made it clear it is willing to spend big to become the No. 1 e-commerce player in the country after failing to make a dent in another huge international market, China. Now, it seems like every week there’s a new rumor of the two homegrown players considering a merger or sale. Alibaba, which owns a stake in Snapdeal and another Indian player, Paytm, is often in the conversation. In any potential talks, however, Flipkart and Snapdeal’s frothy valuations could be a problem. Flipkart was valued last year at $15 billion while Snapdeal most recently secured a $6.5 billion valuation.Google Fiber is pulling back on its broadband rollout as pressure grows to cut costs: For the past year, Ruth Porat, the CFO of Google and its parent Alphabet, has told Wall Street that Google Fiber is her most expensive unit outside of the core business — and is well worth the costs. Her bosses may be telling Fiber employees the opposite. According to a report in The Information, Alphabet chiefs Larry Page and Sergey Brin recently instructed Fiber to severely trim staff and expenses, frustrated with mounting costs of delivering high-speed internet by digging up dirt. Creating broadband networks via traditional pipes is enormously expensive. And Fiber still hasn’t proven that it has figured out a better way to do it. The Information story comes on the heels of reports that Fiber has put plans to build broadband networks on hold in two cities as it ponders ways to roll out experimental wireless tech. Fiber, like the “Other Bets” businesses outside of Google, is facing ongoing scrutiny about its operations. Here are the key parts of The Information’s report. The unit initially shot for five million broadband subscribers in its first years, but has fallen short of that. Last month, Page told Craig Barratt, the CEO of Fiber (or Access, as it’s known), to halve his staff down to 500. Porat, who has developed a reputation as a cost cutter, interceded on Fiber’s behalf, arguing to Page that Fiber’s business model is defensible. Barratt considered leaving earlier in the year, reportedly irked by the changes at Alphabet. If he did, he would not be the first “Other Bets” exec to do so.First driverless taxi hits the streets of Singapore: The first driverless taxi began work on Thursday in a limited public trial on the streets of Singapore. Developer nuTonomy invited a select group of people to download their app and ride for free in its \"robo-taxi\" in a western Singapore hi-tech business district, hoping to get feedback ahead of a planned full launch of the service in 2018.The trial rides took place in a Mitsubishi i-MiEv electric vehicle, with an engineer sitting behind the steering wheel to monitor the system and take control if necessary. The trial is on an on-going basis, nuTonomy said, and follows private testing that began in April. Parker, whose company has partnered with the Singapore government on the project, said he hoped to have 100 taxis working commercially in the Southeast Asian citystate by 2018.Ford leads $24M investment in India-based vehicle rental company Zoomcar: Hot on the heels of a deal with a self-driving sensor technology startup, the automotive giant has backed Zoomcar, a Zipcar-like company that operates in India. Subsidiary Ford Smart Mobility led a $24 million Series B round, with participation from returning investors Sequoia Capital, Nokia Growth Partners (NGP) and Empire Angels. The company’s valuation was not disclosed. Four-year-old Zoomcar closed an $11 million Series B round last summer following an $8 million raise in late 2014. This new round — which had been reported in Indian press as early as July — takes it to over $46 million in VC money to date. Zoomcar is a car rental service based on successful Western models like Zipcar, which wasbought by Avis for $500 million three years ago. The startup is based in Bangalore and it currently claims to offer 2,000 cars around seven of India’s tier-one cities, with 75 percent occupancy and 1.5 million app downloads. Ford was Zoomcar’s first OEM partner, and the startup said Ford provides “most” of the vehicles on its platform.Tesla’s new 100 kWH battery makes it the third-fastest accelerating car ever: Tesla’s Model S and Model X vehicles just got faster. On a call with journalists today, Elon Musk unveiled a larger battery pack — 100 kWH — that enables the Model S to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 2.5 seconds in what the company calls “ludicrous” mode. That makes the Model S the third-fastest production car ever made, after the Ferrari LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder, but it’s the quickest pure electric vehicle that has the capacity to seat up to five adults and two children, according to the company. In an industry first, the battery also enables the car to drive an estimated 315 miles on a single charge. This is the first electric vehicle to go above a range of 300 miles, according to Tesla. The Model S P100D will start at $135,000 — compared to a $125,000 MSRP for the Model S P90D equipped with ludicrous mode — and the Model X P100D will start at $135,500. The Model X P90D started at $115,500.Narrative Science can now describe your Tableau charts for you: Tableau Software‘s shares soared 13 percent on Tuesday following the announcement that the data analytics provider has partnered with Narrative Science, a Chicago-based company that develops natural language generation (NLG) tools. The result of the partnership is Narratives for Tableau, a free Chrome extension that automatically creates written explanations for Tableau graphics. Let’s say, for example, that you have a chart — made with Tableau — of sales and profits of your business for a certain amount of time. The extension, which works with Tableau Server 10.0 or the free Tableau Public service, will generate a narrative description of the data by writing sentences such as “Sales and profit ratio moved in opposite directions from January 2011 to December 2014,” as shown in this example. Narrative Science is best known for Quill, a platform that can take data — say, sports scores — and turn them into stories. Narratives for Tableau is one example of applying Quill’s capabilities, Frankel pointed out. Once Narratives for Tableau has generated the text, users can customize it by choosing a paragraph- or bullet point-style for the description, among other things. If users are not satisfied with the results, they can also make changes to the text.One Kings Lane sold for less than $30 million after being valued at $900 million: One Kings Lane, an online home-furnishings retailer, fetched less than $30 million in its recent sale to Bed Bath & Beyond, according to three people familiar with the deal. The purchase price marks a massive discount from a valuation of $900 million that the startup had secured when it raised more than $100 million from investors in early 2014. In the wake of Dollar Shave Club’s $1 billion sale to Unilever and Walmart’s impending $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet, the One Kings Lane outcome is a reminder of how brutal the e-commerce industry can be for many startups.Former Flipkart CEO’s Employee Clash Shows Indian Startup Trauma..: India’s largest online shopping service is heating up, and not in a good way. Flipkart’s regular Friday townhall grew tense after employees incensed by hundreds of job cuts openly accused management of betrayal. Taken aback, chairman Sachin Bansal countered that the departures stemmed from poor performance and he lost his job as chief executive for the same reason. The co-founder admitted the company had missed financial targets in recent months, prompting an overhaul of its top rungs, according to employees who attended the meeting. He didn’t elaborate but recent moves -- including a brief decision to go mobile app-only after ditching its fashion site -- may have granted an opening to a hard-charging Amazon.com Inc. Bansal’s unusual candor, which drew applause, underscores the plight of the country’s technology sector as competition intensifies and funding begins to dry up...Even as analysts opine that Amazon overtook Flipkart in India July e-commerce sales: Barely three years after launching in India, Amazon (Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd) likely exceeded Flipkart in terms of gross sales in July. Flipkart reported gross sales or gross merchandise value (GMV) of less than Rs.2,000 crore in July, while Amazon’s gross sales crept up above Rs.2,000 crore, according to five people familiar with the companies’ numbers. Another local online marketplace Snapdeal (Jasper Infotech Pvt. Ltd) reported gross sales numbers of roughly Rs.600 crore, a fall of more than 50% from the sales it had been generating until the end of last year, said two other people, familiar with the company’s numbers. Gross sales refer to the value of goods sold on a site, and not net revenue. (Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon are structured as marketplaces because of regulations; their net revenue comprises the commissions they charge their third-party sellers on every transaction and fees for services) To be sure, the numbers are only for the month of July and the market share battle between Flipkart and Amazon is far from over. Flipkart’s numbers also exclude revenue at Myntra and Jabong, the two large fashion retailers it owns. Snapdeal’s numbers exclude sales at FreeCharge, its payments arm. Including Myntra and Jabong revenues, Flipkart is still comfortably ahead of Amazon. Yet, the numbers confirm reports in Mint and other publications since the start of the year that Flipkart and Amazon are running neck-and-neck in the e-commerce market share battle and the latter is close to overtaking it. This is the first time the exact picture has emerged.Chinese investors buy ad tech startup Media.net for $900 million: Advertising technology startup Media.net, founded by tech entrepreneur Divyank Turakhia, said on Monday it had been acquired for about $900 million by a group of Chinese investors. The deal would represent the third-largest in the ad tech industry, after Google's acquisition of DoubleClick and Microsoft Corp's for aQuantive. More here: Ad-tech firm Media.net Sells to China Group for $900 Million: The startup, which powers contextual ads offered by Yahoo! and Microsoft’s Bing, plans a move akin to a reverse merger that would make it a public company in China.Media.net, which is based in Dubai and New York, is touting this as the third-largest ad-tech acquisition in history. However, the complex deal more closely resembles a reverse merger, where a private company takes over a public one and bypasses the formalities of an initial public offering. Technology entrepreneur Divyank Turakhia started Media.net in 2010 and bootstrapped the business. The company provides the technology powering contextual ads offered by Yahoo! Inc. and Microsoft Corp.’s Bing search engine. The system is similar to one offered by Google, choosing which ads to show based on the content of the web page they appear on. The deal comes as merger activity involving ad-tech companies is declining. There were 43 deals during the first half of the year, according to research firm PitchBook Data. That’s a 45 percent decline from the same period last year. Media.net generated $232 million in revenue last year, more than half of which came from mobile visitors, Turakhia said. The U.S. accounts for 90 percent of Media.net’s revenue, but the company is hoping to make a big push into China after the deal, he said. Lyft Is Said to Seek a Buyer, Without Success: It is not an easy thing to be an independent ride-hailing company these days. For one, it takes billions of dollars and hundreds of employees to spread to new cities, to market the service and to recruit drivers. Legislators and local laws are often not in your favor. And competitors with deep pockets from all over the world are waiting to cheer if you happen to fail. Lyft, the second-biggest ride-hailing company in the United States behind Uber, is grappling with those forces — but has found that its options are limited. The company, which is based in San Francisco, has in recent months held talks or made approaches to sell itself to companies including General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing, according to a dozen people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. Lyft’s discussions were most serious with G.M., which is one of the ride-hailing company’s largest investors. Still, G.M. never made a written offer to buy Lyft, said the people, and in the end, Lyft did not find a buyer. Lyft is not in danger of closing down and has a cash cushion of $1.4 billion, some of these people added, so the company will continue as an independent entity. Still, the talks underline how difficult it has become to operate in the ride-hailing market, where people can book rides from drivers through a smartphone app. While ride-hailing companies do not own fleets of cars and instead rely on drivers who have their own vehicles, the business is highly capital-intensive. Venture capitalists and other investors have poured billions of dollars into the companies.Uber Tells Investors It Wouldn’t Pay Above $2 Billion for Lyft: As Lyft Inc. was gauging interest from prospective acquirers, executives from Uber Technologies Inc. told investors in the past few weeks that the company wouldn't pay more than $2 billion to purchase its main U.S. ride-hailing competitor, said people familiar with the matter. Uber didn't make a formal offer, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Uber had previously considered purchasing Lyft as far back as 2014, and the two San Francisco companies have discussed the prospect informally, one of the people said. Despite executives floating the $2 billion price tag, Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick has said privately that he would not support such a deal because he believes it would face intense regulatory scrutiny, the person said. Regardless, Lyft wouldn't consider $2 billion to be a credible offer, said another person familiar with the matter. Recode reported on Friday that Lyft sought as much as $9 billion but failed to secure serious interest. As fierce rivals, Uber has every incentive to downplay Lyft's value to investors and has done so in the past. Lyft and Uber declined to comment.Hampton Creek, Maker of Just Mayo, Is Said to Be Under Inquiry: Hampton Creek, a prominent start-up that is trying to bring tech industry panache to the world of mayonnaise, ranch dressing and other food products, has come under scrutiny by regulators for its business practices. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a preliminary inquiry into Hampton Creek, according to a person briefed on the situation who asked not to be named because it had not been announced publicly. The S.E.C. inquiry is a response to a recent report from Bloomberg News that described an organized effort by Hampton Creek to buy large quantities of its Just Mayo product — a mayonnaise that uses a plant-based ingredient instead of eggs — by sending undercover contractors into stores.Bloomberg’s report said the product buyback effort, which took place in 2014, made Just Mayo seem more popular than it was, not long before Hampton Creek raised $90 million from venture capitalists and other private investors. The basic details of the program were confirmed by a former Hampton Creek employee, who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality restrictions with his onetime employer. The inquiry may be only the start of tougher questions facing Hampton Creek. The company is believed to be losing significant amounts of money. It is raising up to $220 million from investors, according to a Delaware filing provided by Equidate, which tracks private company shares. It’s not uncommon, of course, for start-ups to bleed red ink in their early days. But Hampton Creek, founded in 2011, faces some basic challenges with the manufacturing costs for its products. According to one former employee, in 2014 the company had negative gross margins of about 20 percent on Just Mayo, meaning that the raw cost to the company for every $1 it got in sales was about $1.20. The issue arises from Hampton Creek’s use of premium ingredients in its products without charging shoppers the often eye-popping prices attached to such food products. The vegetable oil used in Just Mayo, for example, does not come from genetically modified organism sources, which adds significant cost, according to the former employee. But on Walmart.com on Friday, a 30-ounce jar of Just Mayo was selling for $3.66 — 32 cents less than a jar of Hellmann’s mayonnaise of the same size.Uber Aims for an Edge in the Race for a Self-Driving Future: On Thursday, Uber said that it would begin testing self-driving cars in Pittsburgh in a matter of weeks, allowing people in the city to hail modified versions of Volvo sport utility vehicles to get around the city. Uber also said it had acquired Otto, a 90-person start-up including former Google and Carnegie Mellon engineers that is focused on developing self-driving truck technology to upend the shipping industry. Those moves are the most recent indications of Uber’s ambitions for autonomous vehicles that can provide services to both consumers and businesses. And they come after Ford Motor’s announcement this week that it would put fleets of self-driving taxis onto American roads in five years. As part of that effort, Ford said it had acquired an Israeli start-up, Saips, that specializes in computer vision, a crucial technology for self-driving cars. Ford also announced investments in three other companies involved in major technologies for driverless vehicles. Suddenly, it seems, both Silicon Valley and Detroit are doubling down on their bets for autonomous vehicles. And in what could emerge as a self-driving-car arms race, the players are investing in, or partnering with, or buying outright the specialty companies most focused on the requisite hardware, software and artificial intelligence capabilities.When Google quietly began working on cars that drive themselves, über was just a German word. Now, nine years later, Uber the ride-hailing company looks set to get regular people inside autonomous vehicles first — a move that’s critical for Uber, and dispiriting for the audacious project hatched inside of Google. Uber said on Thursday that, along with Volvo, it will test a fleet of on-demand autonomous cars in Pittsburgh later this month. An Uber driver will still be in the car. But, more importantly, so will a customer. That’s something that Google has yet to do. When the search giant first unfurled its self-driving plans, it was the only company tackling the advanced tech. Not anymore: All the major car companies have joined the fray — and shown a willingness to cut big checks for the tech behind it. Google is well ahead on the technical challenges of driverless vehicles, according to most in the industry. But those same people, in recent months, have begun asking why, nearly a decade after hiring top roboticists to build its project, Google has not delivered something to market. There are a number of reasons why Google has been a laggard to new rivals in the field. One is its devotion to going fully driverless, a far more difficult feat. That’s partially because, unlike the car companies and Uber, the Google self-driving cars don’t need an immediate revenue stream. They have search ads to bankroll them. Yet other forces may be holding back Google’s cars — like internal dynamics at the project, now within the X subsidiary under Google parent Alphabet. Alphabet has kept its revenue strategy for the unit under wraps. Some sources say that is because they have not settled on one yet. “They went back and forth all the time,” said one person who recently left X. Still, frustration with the inertia of Google’s self-driving car looks to be hitting its own ranks. Chris Urmson, the CTO and former director of the car unit, recently departed, along with two early engineers. Earlier this year, several members of the project, including co-founder Anthony Levandowski, decamped to form Otto, an autonomous trucking startup. With its announcement this morning, Uber also said it had acquired Otto.An Expert in Valuation Says Uber Is Only Worth $28 Billion, Not $62.5 Billion: According to Aswath Damodaran, a professor who specializes in equity valuation at NYU's Stern School of Business, Uber is running up against the roadblock that has thwarted many upstart businesses: Profit. While Damodaran thinks Uber and riding sharing will continue to expand, albeit at a slower pace, he's concerned about whether revenues will follow. China especially worries him given Uber's recent sale of its operations in that country to Didi Chuxing, its biggest rival there. The decision to exit \"even if it was the right one from the perspective of saving itself from a cash war, will reduce its potential revenues in the future.\"  In the other places where Uber does continue to operate, there are often large discounts for riders and other special promotions. This is proof that the business model is challenged, according to Damodaran. \"I believe that a significant portion of their expenses are associating with maintaining revenues rather than growing them,\" he says. \"In effect, it looks like the business model that has brought these companies as far as they have in such a short time period are flawed, because what allowed these companies to grow incredibly fast is getting in the way of converting revenues to profits, since there are no moats to defend.\" Damodaran says that young companies all face a point in time that he calls the \"Bar Mitzvah Moment,\" when the focus shifts from growth to evidence that the business model can be profitable. In his mind, that moment is right now for ride sharing. \"After an initial life, where investors have been easily sated with reports of more ride sharing usage (number of cities served, rides, drivers etc.), these investors are starting to ask the tough questions about how ride sharing companies propose turning these impressive usage statistics into profits.\"Ola shuts TaxiForSure unit, lays off up to 1,000 people: Cab-hailing company Ola has shut its TaxiForSure unit and is laying off as many as 1,000 employees, as the SoftBank Group Corp-backed firm tightens its belt to take on US-based rival Uber. According to at least half-a-dozen people with the direct knowledge of the development, about 90% of the staff being laid off from TaxiForSure works in the company’s call centres, driver relations and business development units. The employees that are being retrenched are located across a dozen cities and are being given three months’ salary as compensation, said the people mentioned above. These include current and former employees of the cab hailing company.Ola had acquired smaller rival TaxiForSure for $200 million in early 2015 to strengthen its position against Uber Technologies Inc. After the acquisition, Ola had centralized TaxiForSure’s operations to three major cities–Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi–and eight smaller cities. The company kept around 250 employees each in the three metros and around 30 each in the eight other cities. The layoff and shutdown comes at a time when Ola is locked in a bruising battle with Uber that involved public spats and legal wrangling. It is also dealing with adverse regulatory environment in various states that affect its operations. The company has been trying for a large fundraise for quite some time. Ola has so far raised around $1.2 billion from investors including Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp. The taxi-hailing firm was valued around $5 billion at the time of its last fundraising. Although Ola had initially planned to retain TaxiForSure as a separate brand, resource crunch seems to have forced the company to wind down the unit. The people cited above said that drivers on TaxiForSure have been moved to the Ola platform. The company has also been prompting TaxiForSure users to migrate to the Ola app in recent months.Cisco Systems to lay off about 14,000 employees: CRN: Cisco is laying off about 14,000 employees, representing nearly 20 percent of the network equipment maker's global workforce, technology news site CRN reported, citing sources close to the company. San Jose, California-based Cisco is expected to announce the cuts within the next few weeks, the report said, as the company transition from its hardware roots into a software-centric organization. Cisco, which had more than 70,000 employees as of April 30, declined to comment. Cisco increasingly requires \"different skill sets\" for the \"software-defined future\" than it did in the past, as it pushes to capture a higher share of the addressable market and aims to boost its margins, the CRN report said citing a source familiar with the situation. Cisco has been investing in new products such as data analytics software and cloud-based tools for data centers, to offset the impact of sluggish spending by telecom carriers and enterprises on its main business of making network switches and routers. The company has already offered many early retirement package plans to Cisco's employees, according to CRN.Ford Promises Fleets of Driverless Cars Within Five Years: At a news conference on Tuesday at the company’s research center in Palo Alto, Calif., Mark Fields, Ford’s chief executive, said the company planned to mass produce driverless cars and have them in commercial operation in a ride-hailing service by 2021.Beyond that, Mr. Fields’s announcement was short on specifics. But he said that the vehicles Ford envisioned would be radically different from those that populate American roads now. “That means there’s going to be no steering wheel. There’s going to be no gas pedal. There’s going to be no brake pedal,’’ he said. “If someone had told you 10 years ago, or even five years ago, that the C.E.O. of a major automaker American car company is going to be announcing the mass production of fully autonomous vehicles, they would have been called crazy or nuts or both.” The company also said on Tuesday that as part of the effort, it planned to expand its Palo Alto center, doubling the number of employees who work there over the next year, from the current 130. Ford also said it had acquired an Israeli start-up, Saips, that specializes in computer vision, a crucial technology for self-driving cars. And the automaker announced investments in three other companies involved in major technologies for driverless vehicles.Univision is buying Gawker Media for $135 million: Univision has won the auction for Gawker Media. The TV network and digital publisher has agreed to pay $135 million for the bankrupt blog network, according to a person familiar with the deal. Univision’s offer will encompass all seven of Gawker Media’s sites, including Gawker.com Ziff Davis and Univision were the only two bidders for Gawker, which filed for bankruptcy after Hulk Hogan and Peter Thiel won a $140 million judgment in a privacy case. Ziff Davis had originally offered $90 million for Gawker Media. The deal won’t be official for a bit. For starters, a U.S. bankruptcy court judge needs to sign off on the transaction. When it is final, the judgment funds will be set aside while Gawker appeals its court case; eventually the money will go to the side that wins. Whatever the result of the case, the auction is a disappointing conclusion for Denton, who founded the company in 2002. Last year, as rival media companies like Vice, BuzzFeed and Vox Media (which owns this site) were raising money at increasingly high valuations, Denton was arguing that his company was worth $250 million or more.‘Shadow Brokers’ Leak Raises Alarming Question: Was the N.S.A. Hacked? The release on websites this week of what appears to be top-secret computer code that the National Security Agency has used to break into the networks of foreign governments and other espionage targets has caused deep concern inside American intelligence agencies, raising the question of whether America’s own elite operatives have been hacked and their methods revealed. Most outside experts who examined the posts, by a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, said they contained what appeared to be genuine samples of the code — though somewhat outdated — used in the production of the N.S.A.’s custom-built malware.Most of the code was designed to break through network firewalls and get inside the computer systems of competitors like Russia, China and Iran. That, in turn, allows the N.S.A. to place “implants” in the system, which can lurk unseen for years and be used to monitor network traffic or enable a debilitating computer attack. According to these experts, the coding resembled a series of “products” developed inside the N.S.A.’s highly classified Tailored Access Operations unit, some of which were described in general terms in documents stolen three years ago by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor now living in Russia. But the code does not appear to have come from Mr. Snowden’s archive, which was mostly composed of PowerPoint files and other documents that described N.S.A. programs. The documents released by Mr. Snowden and his associates contained no actual source code used to break into the networks of foreign powers. Whoever obtained the source code apparently broke into either the top-secret, highly compartmentalized computer servers of the N.S.A. or other servers around the world that the agency would have used to store the files. The code that was published on Monday dates to mid-2013, when, after Mr. Snowden’s disclosures, the agency shuttered many of its existing servers and moved code to new ones as a security measure. While still widely considered the most talented group of state-sponsored hackers in the world, the N.S.A. is still recovering from Mr. Snowden’s disclosures; it has spent hundreds of millions of dollars reconfiguring and locking down its systems.Microsoft’s HoloLens Technology Adopted by Israeli Military: If Pokemon Go achieved one thing, it was showing the world that augmented realitytechnologies are ready for the mainstream. Israel’s military thinks AR is ready for another use: battlefield training. The Israeli army’s C2 Systems Department recently purchased two HoloLens glasses from Microsoft Corp. The commander of the head programming department, Major Rotem Bashi, intends to develop the technology to improve battlefield strategy and train field personnel. And quickly: He intends for HoloLens to be used on active duty within months. At the army base outside Tel Aviv, a handful of developers in Bashi’s team created a software program in less than a month that allows commanders to manipulate military terrain models and intelligence data to monitor troop positioning from enemy vantage points. Battlefield maps are superimposed on top of the real terrain, streamed in via satellite, to create a blend that can be interacted with via sight, voice and hand gestures. The unit is now finding ways to allow HoloLens-wearing medics to operate on wounded with simultaneous instruction from trained surgeons, and combat soldiers to fix equipment malfunctions. It’s far removed from hurling Pokeballs at Pidgeys and Rattatas in Pokemon Go, but based on similar principles. Besides adapting the HoloLens to military life, Bashi’s unit is working on a product that will give headquarters an online report about a combatant’s physiological state in the field.Peter Thiel says journalism will be just fine, since he’ll decide what’s good journalism: Peter Thiel is a billionaire who decided he didn’t like Gawker Media after it outed him as gay. So he funded Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against the company, and they won. Now Gawker is selling itself in a bankruptcy auction. Today, the same day that bids for Gawker are due, Thiel published an op-ed in the New York Timesas a sort of victory lap, but also to muster votes for a bill currently wending its way through Congress, the Intimate Privacy Protection Act. It's more commonly known as the revenge-porn bill, which would make it illegal to transmit private images and messages, but Thiel has co-opted it for his own purposes, referring to it by a lesser-known nickname, the Gawker Bill. But the most interesting part of Thiel’s editorial is what he says about the need for a free press: It’s telling that despite the fact he felt Gawker had invaded his privacy, Thiel himself never filed a lawsuit — he’s fighting via proxies. In trying to determine what should and shouldn’t qualify as journalism, Thiel is exercising the classic Silicon Valley pretension to attempt to own the definition, to write its own narrative, devoid of context or skepticism. But smart publishers will react to Thiel’s call to arms in a similar vein to the closing words of his editorial: He can’t do it, if we don’t let him.Microsoft is buying a company that lets viewers control video game live streams: Today, Microsoft announced its plans to acquire live streaming service Beam, a Seattle-based company that lets users influence and interact with a video game being streamed by another player. Beam launched in January to compete against well-established game streaming services from Twitch and YouTube. It set itself apart by taking a core concept made popular by streamers — the notion of letting players control a game from afar — and turning into a unique streaming platform. For instance, Beam lets viewers suggest challenges for streamers and even alter in-game aspects like weapon loadout and quest selection. It also lets developers create special button layouts for viewers to interact with games being streamed through Beam. To maintain quality, the company's technology drastically reduces the lag between a player's actions and what the viewers see on the stream, whereas competitors like Twitch have a roughly 10 to 15 second delay. It's unclear how Microsoft plans to incorporate Beam's technology into its own online gaming platform. But the company points to Minecraft, now a Microsoft property, as the type of game well-suited to Beam's technology. Microsoft did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.One year later, Alphabet is a tale of two Googles: Today marks the one year anniversary of the day Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin picked a new name and an audacious corporate structure in an attempt to spawn gigantic tech businesses in industries way beyond web search. So far, the year has been great for Google. Unshackled from the unprofitable moonshots, its balance sheet and steady ads business growth has reassured investors. The business soars: Revenues topped 21 percent growth last quarter and operating margins keep getting fatter. More focus: One senior exec at Google recently explained a key change from the Alphabet reorg: Before, meetings cluttered with discussion of extraneous projects — the self-driving cars, medical doodads and internet balloons. Now, Google meetings are spent on Google alone. Porat appeases Wall Street: Not too long ago, investors were making fretful phone calls about Google’s abundant spending. Not anymore. Thank Ruth Porat, the former Morgan Stanley CFO who helped orchestrate the Alphabet reshuffle. “Implementing a competitive culture in what was becoming a behemoth — that’s critical,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “Ruth Porat has been priced into the stock.” About that stock: It has climbed nearly 24 percent since August 10th of last year. It’s been bumpier for “Other Bets,” the hodgepodge, ever-evolving group of companies outside of Google that Page and Brin desperately want to behave like lean, world-changing startups. Losses added: Alphabet poured $859 million into these units last quarter, nearly $300 million more than the same quarter last year. New equity: Employees at the non-Google company may soon have to get used to new stock packages — ones that aren’t tied to that soaring Google.VC Funding Is Drying Up for Media Startups: As venture capitalists exercise more caution and place fewer bets, they’re leaving media startups behind. Venture funding to media-tech companies slid for the third consecutive quarter to $91.7 million, the lowest amount since mid-2013, according to data from industry researcher CB Insights. Investment activity followed a similar trend, declining to the fewest number of deals since the second quarter of 2012. While U.S. venture deals were down overall in the first half of the year, the drop in funding to media companies has outpaced declines in other sectors, said Garrett Black, an analyst at researcher PitchBook. Investors worry the businesses are expensive to run compared with software makers and struggle to keep readers’ attention.The decline in venture funding comes amid a moment of reckoning across the digital media landscape. Web publishers like Mashable Inc. and International Business Times have fired dozens of employees this year. Smaller players are seeking new business models as they struggle to sustain themselves on digital advertising, which is being increasingly dominated by Google and Facebook Inc. Many of them are shifting their business to focus on web video, where advertising rates are higher. Media hasn’t traditionally been the top investment area for VCs, but some big wins drew interest to the sector. AOL spent $315 million to acquire the Huffington Post in 2011, and the publication has become a cornerstone of Verizon Communications Inc.’s media strategy since it bought AOL. German publisher Axel Springer SE took over Business Insider last year in a $343 million deal, a win for backers including Institutional Venture Partners and Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos.Bill Maris, the CEO and founder of Google Ventures, is leaving: Bill Maris, the founder and chief of Google Ventures (or GV), is leaving the firm and its parent, Alphabet,Recode has learned. His last day, said sources, is Friday. Maris would be the third high-ranking executive to depart from the Alphabet units outside of the main Google search business in recent months, as the tech giant continues to stumble through the transition into its new corporate structure. Sources say Maris is being replaced by David Krane, a managing partner for the venture arm and one of the earliest corporate communications managers at Google.Maris, an early web entrepreneur, founded Google’s venture capital arm in 2009 and quickly built it into a formidable presence in Silicon Valley. In 2015, the firm managed upwards of $2.4 billion in capital. Although GV cut back on investments in Europe and with early stage companies, the firm is still willing to cut checks. For the first six months of this year, it passed Intel Capital as the most active corporate venture arm, according to CB Insights. Under Maris, GV has had some high-profile misses — most notably, the disastrous app Secret. But those were outweighed by early bets in gigantic startups like Uber, Nest, Slack and Jet.com, which just went to Walmart for $3 billion.Virtual Reality Classrooms Another Way Chinese Kids Gain an Edge: Deep within a building shaped like the Starship Enterprise, a little-known Chinese company is working on the future of education. Vast banks of servers record children at work and play, tracking touchscreen swipes, shrugs and head swivels - amassing a database that will be used to build intimate profiles of millions of kids. This is the Fuzhou hive of NetDragon Websoft Holdings Ltd. a hack-and-slash videogame maker and unlikely candidate to transform learning via headset-mounted virtual reality teachers. It’s one of a growing number of companies from International Business Machines Corp. to Lenovo Group Ltd. studying how to use technology like VR to arrest a fickle child’s attention. (And perhaps someday to make a mint from that data by showing them ads.) China - where parents have been known to try anything to give their kids an edge and tend to be less obsessive about privacy - may be an ideal testing ground for the VR classroom of the future. As it’s envisioned, there’ll be no napping in the back row. Lessons change when software predicts a student’s mind is wandering by spotting an upward tilt of the head. Dull lectures can be immediately livened up with pop quizzes. Even the instructor’s gender can change to suit the audience, such as making the virtual educator male in cultures where teachers are typically men.The notion of adaptive, computer-based teaching has bounced around for more than a decade. Done right, it’s got the potential to fundamentally alter learning. Educators who’ve relied on their gut and visual cues could be replaced or augmented by digital avatars powered by algorithms, which can in turn be replicated across the planet. Advocates argue that the benefits of using machines to scrutinize children and learning to adapt to their foibles will outweigh questions of privacy because soon there won’t be enough human teachers.India ride-hailing firm Ola sideswiped as Uber, Didi team up in China: Didi Chuxing's acquisition of Uber's China business last week reshapes the landscape in Asia's growing ride-hailing sector, and leaves India's Ola more vulnerable to attack by Uber in its $12 billion home market. Four months ago, Ola executives met with Didi hoping the Chinese firm would invest fresh capital to help it fight Uber Technologies Inc which, with its deeper pockets, has made rapid inroads into India. They were told Didi wanted first to sort out its own challenges in China, said a person with direct knowledge of Ola's plans. Didi and Uber have raised and spent billions of dollars in a discount slugfest to win drivers, passengers and market share in China. Didi, now worth around $35 billion, last year invested about $30 million in Ola, which is also backed by Japan's SoftBank Group, and the two are allies in an anti-Uber group that also includes U.S.-based Lyft and Southeast Asia-focused Grab. \"This (Didi/Uber China) deal changes the dynamics of how they (Didi) will invest in India,\" said the person, who didn't want to be named because the discussions were private. If Didi invests more in Ola, it's effectively betting against Uber, its new partner in China, the person said. It's not clear whether Didi would provide equity or debt to Ola, which has raised around $1.3 billion in funding and is valued at over $5 billion. SoftBank Capital, Ola's key investor, faces its own financial issues and is selling assets to raise cash and reduce debt, which may pose another fundraising challenge for Ola, which was aiming to raise another $1 billion this year.After the Didi deal, Uber is even more focused on India, which it has previously called its No. 2 priority overseas market, doubling down on resources, staffing and technology deployed there, said two people familiar with Uber's plans, one of whom is based in the United States.Twitter Seeks to Sublease Part of San Francisco Headquarters: Twitter Inc. is offering about a quarter of the space at its San Francisco headquarters complex for sublease, adding to a growing amount of excess offices available in the city as the technology industry cools. About 78,800 square feet (7,320 square meters) is listed for sublease on the seventh floor of 1355 Market St., a renovated 1930s furniture mart, and 104,850 square feet is available along three floors in an adjacent building at One Tenth St., according to marketing materials from Cresa, a commercial real estate firm.Subleasing is becoming more prevalent in San Francisco as venture-capital investments decline and tech firms slow their hiring from a breakneck pace. While the city’s overall office market remains strong, extra space is a warning sign that some companies overestimated their growth rate and are being forced to scale back. An increase in subleasing predated commercial real estate downturns following the 2008 financial crisis and the dot-com bust in the late 1990s.Walmart was the only bidder in $3 billion Jet.com acquisition: When news first broke of Walmart’s interest in acquiring Jet.com, the $3 billion price tag was a surprise to many. Why would Walmart pay such a premium for a startup that was unprofitable and just a year old? One hypothesis was that Walmart may have been competing against other bidders for Jet — possibly Alibaba or even Google. Turns out that was not the case, Jet CEO Marc Lore told Recode in an interview Monday afternoon. “This was about trust between Doug and I,” Lore said in reference to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, noting that the conversations between the two sides began in the spring. “It never occurred to me to go out and get another offer, quite honestly,” he added.  As part of the deal, Lore will take over as head of Walmart.com in addition to Jet, as Recode first reportedSunday evening. Neil Ashe, Walmart’s CEO of global e-commerce, will depart at the end of Walmart’s fiscal year. In a conference call with reporters, McMillon outlined why Walmart found Jet so valuable. It was a combination of the speed of the shopping site’s growth (a $1 billion annualized sales volume run rate within eight months of launch); the expertise of the exec team led by Lore that is joining Walmart in the deal; and the proprietary pricing and back-end technology that is expected to eventually be used in some capacity on Walmart.com.Airbnb raising a reported $850M at a $30B valuation: Almost a year after its last raise of $1.6 billion, the company is said to be adding $850 million to its coffers, according to information obtained by Equidate. While $850 million is a ton of cash, it is not the largest round the company has raised. Last year, the company raised $1.5 billion in one of the largest VC rounds in history. The additional capital would only move Airbnb from the fifth to the forth most valuable tech unicorn at a potential valuation of $30 billion (tear).  Even as a late-stage company, Airbnb has to be increasingly conscious of the capital it takes on. Too much equity dilutes early investors, while too much debt could put investors at risk if valuations were to suddenly tank. Debt as an asset class is paid off before equity. Airbnb has notoriously taken actions to strategically prolong an IPO, bringing on a $1 billion credit faculty last year to support growth without diluting investors. The company previously had an approximate valuation of $27 billion, so while the round is large, it doesn’t deviate from prior anti-dilution strategies. With respect to deals that Airbnb reportedly walked away from, the $850 million dollar deal is tame. The Wall Street Journalreported that Airbnb left money on the table, rejecting a deal that would have valued the company at $34 billion.Bitfinex exchange customers to get 36 percent haircut, debt token: Crypto-currency exchange Bitfinex, which lost $72 million to hackers last week, told customers on Sunday they would lose just over 36 percent of the assets they had on the platform but would be compensated for these losses with tokens of credit. The Hong Kong-based exchange said losses from the theft would be shared, or \"generalized\", across all the company's clients and assets, widening the group of those affected announced last week. \"This is the closest approximation to what would happen in a liquidation context,\" Bitfinex said on its website early on Sunday. \"Upon logging into the platform, customers will see that they have experienced a generalized loss percentage of 36.067 percent.\" The company said it would also give all affected clients a \"BFX\" token crediting their losses that could be redeemed by the exchange or for shares in iFinex, the exchange's parent company. Bitfinex said it would explain its methodology in a later update and that it was talking to investors about how to fully compensate its customers. Hackers stole 119,756 bitcoin from Bitfinex last week in the second-biggest breach of a crypto-currency exchange ever, in U.S. dollar terms. The hack accounted for about 0.75 percent of all bitcoins in circulation. The exchange is the world's largest for trading digital currencies such as bitcoin, litecoin and ether, and is used for its deep liquidity in U.S. dollar/bitcoin trades. It is still not clear how the hackers gained access to the company's customer accounts. However, both Bitfinex and outside experts have dismissed suggestions the breach was due to the security of the blockchain, the decentralized ledger that tracks every bitcoin transaction, and which traditional banks are considering adopting to increase the speed and transparency of their transactions.Meet the China ‘whisperers’ who get the big deals done in Silicon Valley: When Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick wanted advice about whom to hire to run his ride-hailing business in China, he asked Carmen Chang, a longtime Silicon Valley lawyer and investor who had helped a previous generation of tech companies navigate that murky territory. When Uber sold its China business to its rival Didi this week, Chang was a trusted confidante.When Lyft, Uber’s smaller rival, needed an entree into China, the company’s president turned to another Silicon Valley insider who shuttles between worlds. The introduction from Connie Chan, a partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, to China’s largest ride-hailing company led to a $100 million investment and partnership. Behind the scenes of an unprecedented flood of capital from China into Silicon Valley over the past two years is an elite network of brokers. These brokers do more than deal-making; they play anthropologist and cultural translator -- from coaching startup founders about the culturally appropriate place to sit at a conference room table in China to breaking down how emojis are used in Chinese apps. Their acumen is growing more valuable, entrepreneurs say, as they navigate a cast of hard-to-parse characters with alluring deep pockets and promises of big business opportunities overseas. “She is the whisperer between China and Silicon Valley,” said Matthew Prince, chief executive of Cloudflare, a web security startup, of Chang. Last year, Chang helped Prince -- whose company had given up on China in 2011 -- clinch a partnership with Baidu, China’s search giant. “There’s very few that really understand both sides.” Chang, who was born in Nanjing, China, came to the States to seek a doctorate in Modern Chinese History. She got pulled into tech industry after graduating from Stanford Law School in the early 1990s, when she got a job as an associate at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, the Silicon Valley firm known for its ties to the clubby venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road. One of her early clients was Masayoshi Son, the billionaire Japanese investor who founded the Japanese telcommunications giant Softbank. At the time, she said, senior management at the firm had never been to Asia, and Son “wasn’t considered important enough” to be represented by a general partner. “So he got an associate,” she says.Lyft hit a record of 14 million rides last month with run-rate revenue of as much as $500 million: July was a record month for Lyft, which performed 13.9 million rides, according to a letter the company sends its investors on a monthly basis that Recode obtained.That’s 1.5 million more rides, or 12 percent more, than the company performed in June 2016 and amounts to 167 million rides on an annual run-rate basis, according to the document. The company also hit more than $2 billion in what it calls net ride value for the first time in its history, on a run-rate basis. Net ride value — not to be confused with Lyft’s revenue — is the amount passengers pay without accounting for tips and tolls. Lyft takes anywhere from 20 to 25 percent of the fare, which means the company’s run-rate revenue for the year is between $400 million and $500 million. The leaked document comes at a time when the company is under pressure to sell right after Uber sold its China operations to homegrown competitor Didi. The two companies have essentially agreed to operate a monopoly in China after years of battling for customers and riders through price enticements that made it hard to turn profit. Market dominance is more important than ever as ride-hailing startups look to turn a profit. Uber is likely to seek an IPO next year, and Lyft will have to find a buyer to help it better compete.Uber to Sell to Rival Didi Chuxing and Create New Business in China: In a stark signal of how difficult it is for American technology companies to thrive in China, Uber China said it was selling itself to Didi Chuxing, its fiercest rival there. The sale, which would create a new company worth about $35 billion, would end the great ride-hailing battle of China. A person with knowledge of the deal said Uber investors had been pushing for such a transaction. The companies have been fighting relentlessly for market share in mainland China for two years, spending tens of millions of dollars every month to attract riders and drivers. The merger would end that competition and create significant scale, but it would also be a repudiation of Uber’s ambitions to take on local Chinese competitors in their huge home market.Still, it is by no means a financial catastrophe for Uber, which for about $2 billion of investment in the Chinese market gets a $7 billion share in a company that is likely to grow. It also saves the cash it may have spent competing in China for other projects.Under the terms of the deal, the new company’s estimated worth is a combination of Didi Chuxing’s $28 billion valuation and Uber China’s $7 billion, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information had not yet been made public. Uber shareholders would receive a 20 percent stake in the new company. Didi Chuxing would also make a $1 billion investment in the company’s operations in the rest of the world, called Uber Global, which was lastvalued at $62.5 billion, according to the two people with knowledge of the sale. Bloomberg first reported news of the deal.Didi Schools Uber on Doing Business in Cut-Throat Chinese Market: The deal is the culmination of more than a year of take-no-prisoners war between the world’s two largest ride-sharing companies, a series of clashes played out in the media and on the dusty streets of hundreds of cities. That battle, waged through massive subsidies on rides, wound up costing Uber $2 billion, the people said. Alarmed, its investors clamored for a ceasefire.In the end, Didi proved too resourceful -- and too well-connected -- for the ride-sharing giant to dethrone. Uber threw in the towel just days after China banned the practice of charging less than the cost of a ride, depriving the U.S. company of a tried-and-true engagement tactic. In a blogpost obtained by Bloomberg before an official announcement, Kalanick portrayed the deal as a merger that strengthens both parties; others, including Grab CEO Anthony Tan, saw it as a humbled Uber taking its ball elsewhere.But Didi proved more creative, and local connections came through. The conflict took an unusual turn as third parties began to get drawn into the mix. In August, Uber complained it had been blocked from WeChat, the popular messaging service run by Didi-backer Tencent. Then Didi recruited allies, forging a four-way alliance with ride-sharing services that compete with Uber, including Lyft Inc. in the U.S., Grab and India’s Ola. Didi gained confidence as it entered the new year. From President Jean Liu on down, its executives were determined to deal a knockout blow. Didi began raising more money and its emboldened executives openly declared victory. “We will be the last one standing,” Stephen Zhu, vice president of strategy, said in what proved to be a prescient April address.Recent funding saw Uber’s valuation swell to $68 billion and the company said it had access to more than $11 billion on its balance sheet. Didi, said to be valued at close to $28 billion, had more than $10 billion at its disposal. In the end, Didi proved too large an opponent, with backers including some of China’s largest government institutions and even Apple Inc. The four-year-old company now handles more than 11 million rides a day and serves about 300 million users across some 400 cities, offering taxis, private cars, ride sharing and test driving.Didi’s acquisition of Uber China throws the global anti-Uber alliance in doubt: Didi Chuxing, China’s homegrown ride-hailing startup, was the glue that held together the global anti-Uber alliance that included Lyft, Grab and Ola. But now that Didi has acquired Uber’s China operations, that partnership has been thrown into doubt. In addition to a $1 billion investment Didi is making into Uber, the deal also brings Uber CEO Travis Kalanick onto Didi Chuxing’s board and Didi Chairman Cheng Wei onto Uber’s board. Both Kalanick and Wei are non-voting members of the board. That means, as of last night, Didi Chuxing is more invested in Uber’s success than it is in the alliance. Didi, so far, had invested about $100 million in Lyft, $350 million in Grab and $30 million in Ola, altogether about $480 million, less than half of what it just invested in Uber.More news on this: Uber’s surrender in China puts more pressure on big tech companies to thrive in IndiaDelphi, Singapore launch test of self-driving taxis: Delphi Automotive Plc will launch a small test fleet of automated taxis in Singapore next year, aiming to ferry passengers around a city district in one of the first real-world tests of automated rides on demand, the company said on Monday. The project, run in partnership with the Singapore Land Transport Authority, will road test a concept that many companies investing in automated driving believe offers the fastest path to making such technology commercially viable. A cab ride in a dense urban area can cost $3 to 4 a mile, Delphi vice president of engineering Glen DeVos said in an interview. “We think we can get to 90 cents a mile” with an automated vehicle. That drops the price of transporting goods and people, and allows for the costs of automated driving systems to be spread over hours of operation and multiple users. Initially, the cars will have drivers ready to take over if the piloting systems fail, DeVos said. But by 2019 or 2020, “we’ll have removed drivers from the car,” Glen DeVos, Delphi’s vice president of engineering said in an interview.Microsoft Sells $19.75 Billion of Bonds in Its Biggest Ever Sale: Microsoft Corp. raised $19.75 billion in the third-largest U.S. corporate bond sale of the year to help finance its planned purchase of LinkedIn Corp. Investors put in more than $50 billion of orders for the deal in the software maker’s biggest ever sale. The strong demand helped Microsoft to borrow at lower rates than it paid for the $13 billion of bonds it raised in October. It also saved about $40 million in annual interest payments compared with what it was offering to pay initially, according to people familiar with the matter. Investors have been clamoring for U.S. corporate debt in recent months. Yields are turning negative on a growing number of bonds globally as central banks in Japan and Europe ramp up stimulus packages, spurring money managers to seek higher returns in the U.S.S&P Global Ratings assigned the bonds the top AAA grade in a note reviewing the sale on Monday. Moody’s Investors Service also gave the bonds its top grade. The longest portion of the debt is a 40-year bond that yields 1.8 percentage points above Treasuries. On Thursday, Apple Inc. sold $7 billion of bonds. Investors opened their wallets for the iPhone maker, allowing the company to lower yields on all portions of the offering, which was funding shareholder buybacks. Like Apple, Microsoft’s debt issuance is tied to avoiding an increase in its tax bill. Companies with cash holdings from overseas profits have to pay a 35 percent tax to repatriate those funds to the U.S. Rather than use that cash to fund its acquisition and pay the hefty taxes that result, it is far cheaper for large multinationals like Microsoft to borrow the funds.A quiet news weekend, but lots of big news from Friday, which I've recapped below.Oracle’s $9.3 Billion Deal for NetSuite Will Bolster Its Cloud Offerings: When Evan M. Goldberg founded NetSuite in 1998, he did so with backing from his former boss, Lawrence J. Ellison, who started the software giant Oracle. On Thursday, their relationship came full circle as Oracle agreed to acquire NetSuite for $9.3 billion to beef up its cloud offerings.The NetSuite deal is Oracle’s largest acquisition since it bought PeopleSoft for $10.3 billion in 2004, according to data from Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence. That deal, a hostile takeover fought out over 18 months, extended Oracle’s customer base and product offerings. It made Oracle bigger, but it did not change its business model. About 5,000 PeopleSoft employees, close to half the company, were laid off in the following months. The NetSuite purchase, on the other hand, is at the heart of Oracle’s fight to remake itself for the modern world of cloud computing, or providing accessing to vast computational resources over the internet. This transition has shaken up the software business for the last several years. Companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon have created markets worth billions, and older companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Oracle have struggled to change the way they make and sell their products.The deal also illustrates that, for all the reach and novelty of tech, Silicon Valley remains a very small place with long personal histories. Mr. Goldberg got the idea for NetSuite after conversations with Mr. Ellison about where else the internet might go. Down the hall was another rising star at Oracle, named Marc Benioff. Mr. Benioff started a company called Salesforce.com within weeks of NetSuite’s start, also with backing from Mr. Ellison. Today, Salesforce is regarded as the leading company selling only cloud software, with a market capitalization of $55.7 billion. The relationship between Oracle and Salesforce is testy, however. In 2011, Mr. Benioff was kicked out of a big Oracle conference after he lampooned Oracle’s cloud efforts. And now the NetSuite technology will help Oracle compete more directly with Salesforce for customers.Flipkart valuation shrinks again; firm reveals job cuts: Global asset manager T. Rowe Price Group Inc. has reduced the value of its stake in Flipkart Ltd by a fifth, its second cut in four months, reflecting continued investor concerns over the valuations of technology start-ups. The move came ahead of a statement by Flipkart on Friday that it was cutting 300 to 600 additional jobs, after already shrinking its workforce to 30,000 from 33,000 at the start of the year to reduce costs. US-based T. Rowe Price lowered the value of its holding in Flipkart to $96.29 per share, a 20% erosion, according to a filing the investment manager made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the quarter ended June. That values Flipkart at $10.3 billion, according to T. Rowe Price. The firm had earlier cut the value of its stake in Flipkart by 15% in April.On Friday, a Flipkart spokeswoman said the company had cut 300 to 600 jobs.The Economic Times reported on Friday that Flipkart was offering employees who had failed to meet expectations the choice to either resign or be sent off with severance pay, adding that the move was expected to impact 700-1,000 staff.$1 Billion for Dollar Shave Club: Why Every Company Should Worry: Unilever is paying $1 billion for Dollar Shave Club, a five-year-old start-up that sells razors and other personal products for men. Every other company should be afraid, very afraid. The deal anecdotally shows that no company is safe from the creative destruction brought by technological change. The very nature of a company is fundamentally changing, becoming smaller and leaner with far fewer employees. Dollar Shave Club was a phenom in the men’s grooming industry. The online business was founded in 2011 by Mark Levine and Michael Dubin to combat the high cost of razors. The idea was rather simple. Instead of paying $10 or $20 a month at a store for disposable razors, a Dollar Shave Club subscriber could go online and set up a regular order to be shipped to his home monthly at a fraction of the retail cost. The experiment was a brave one. Until that time, Gillette dominated the razor business and was in an arms race with itself to add yet more blades and other features to its razors. Gillette was so dominant in advertising and shelf space that Procter & Gamble paid $57 billion for the company in 2005. Everything changed in 2012, when Mr. Dubin’s comedic free ad posted on YouTube. Within 24 hours, the new business had more than 12,000 orders, more than it could handle. The ad went on to get over 20 million views and rocket Dollar Shave Club to over $240 million in revenue. The wealth will be spread among a few. Dollar Shave Club has over three million subscribers but only about 190 employees. Its razors were made in South Korea by Dorco. Distribution was initially handled in-house but eventually was contracted to a third-party company in Kentucky. What remained was a terrific design, marketing and customer service shop; and a business that was easily expandable to meet demand and that had a good niche with men who do not like to shop. These super-successful companies with few employees should worry an America struggling with inequality. That is the way things roll these days. It used to be that if you wanted to sell razors, you needed a factory, a distribution center, a sales force, a research and development team and a marketing budget. Keeping all of these functions under one roof lowered transaction costs and made operations more efficient. In part this was because of communication structures — having telephone and mail together was a necessity. But the internet, mass transportation and globalization destroy everything. If you do not believe this change is about brand, experience and disruption, know that you can buy razors directly from Dorco, presumably the same brands sold by Dollar Shave Club.Flipkart-owned Myntra acquires Jabong for $70 mn in all-cash deal: Flipkart-owned Myntra today said it has acquired Jabong from Global Fashion Group for USD 70 million. Myntra, which itself was acquired by Flipkart in 2014 in an estimated Rs 2,000 crore deal, will have access to a combined base of 15 million monthly active users.Jabong has been in the market for a sell-off and was in discussion with companies including Future Group, Snapdeal and Aditya Birla-owned Abof among others. Jabong was founded in 2012. In September 2014, its investor, Rocket Internet merged Jabong with four other online fashion retailers in Latin America, Russia, the Middle East, South-east Asia and Australia to create Global Fashion Group (GFG). Swedish investment firm Kinnevik also owns a large stake in Jabong's parent Global Fashion Group. While Jabong has managed to reduce losses by reducing discounts, both Kinnevik and Rocket Internet seem unwilling to infuse fresh capital and are believed to be keen to exit.Analyst Downgrades Apple and Says It Has 'Peaked': With Apple Inc's earnings report just a day away, Wall Street analysts are more at oddsthan ever, and one of them in particular anticipates tough times for the tech giant. \"Our opinion [is] that Apple has peaked under the leadership of CEO Tim Cook,\" Colin Gillis of BGC Financial L.P. said in a note this week. \"Our view that that there is risk that the upgrade rate for the next iPhone may slow even more than the upgrade rate cycle of 6s, which has been materially lower than the upgrade rate of the iPhone 6 as per the company.\" However, others disagree and say that while things haven't been great as of late, things will get better next year. \"Amid pervasive investor fear and negativity, we see results/guidance as not great but good enough to start swinging the tide from near-term fear to cautious optimism about the future,\" Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company LLC said in a note. \"Given our installed base work, we see a \"super-cycle\" in '17 and iPhone 7 could even sell a little better than bearish expectations.\" Even Gillis acknowledges that shares could see a move higher after earnings due to the low expectations. After that bounce, though, his pessimism continues. \"[W]hen we ask ourselves 'Do we see Apple gaining or losing its next $100 billion of value,' the answer is losing.\"Investors realize Nintendo didn’t develop Pokémon Go and shares plummet: Nintendo’s shares plunged after the company said late Friday that the worldwide success of Pokémon Go will not significantly impact its financial results. Nothing Nintendo disclosed about the ownership of the game was new information, but markets were shocked anyway. The stock sank 18 percent to 23,220 yen at the close in Tokyo, the maximum one-day move allowed by the exchange, noted Bloomberg. After the drop, Nintendo’s stock remained flat. In morning trading today, the Kyoto-based company’s shares were down $2.36, or 8.14 percent, at $26.64.On Friday, Nintendo put out a statement pointing out that it owns only 32 percent of the voting power of The Pokémon Company, an affiliated company that holds the ownership rights to Pokémon. Nintendo also owns 13 percent of Niantic, the San Francisco-based mobile developer spun out of Google last year who developed and distributed the game. “Because of this accounting scheme, the income reflected on the company’s consolidated business results is limited,” Nintendo wrote in a notice. Also, Nintendo said that “Pokémon Go Plus,” its peripheral device for use with the application, is scheduled for release and it’s already reflected in the financial forecast. Following Pokémon Go’s release in the U.S. at the beginning of July, Nintendo’s market valuation soared to more than $40 billion, passing Sony. Verizon to Pay $4.8 Billion for Yahoo’s Core Business: the internet is an unforgiving place for yesterday’s great idea, and on Sunday, Yahoo reached the end of the line as an independent company. The board of the Silicon Valley company agreed to sell Yahoo’s core internet operations and land holdings to Verizon for $4.8 billion, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak about the deal before the planned announcement on Monday morning. After the sale, Yahoo shareholders will be left with about $41 billion in investments in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, as well as Yahoo Japan and a small portfolio of patents.That’s a pittance compared with Yahoo’s peak value of more than $125 billion, reached in January 2000. Founded in 1994, Yahoo was one of the last independently operated pioneers of the web. Many of those groundbreaking companies, like the maker of the web browser Netscape, never made it to the end of the first dot-com boom. But Yahoo, despite constant management turmoil, kept growing. Started as a directory of websites, the company was soon doing much more, offering searches, email, shopping and news. Those services, which were free to consumers, were supported by advertising displayed on its various pages. For a long time, the model worked. It seemed like every company in America — and across much of the world — wanted to reach people using the new medium, and ad revenue poured in to Yahoo.In the end, the company was done in by Google and Facebook, two younger behemoths that figured out that survival was a continuous process of reinvention and staying ahead of the next big thing. Yahoo, which flirted with buying both companies in their infancy, watched its fortunes sink as users moved on to apps and social networks. Verizon, one of the nation’s biggest telecommunications companies, plans to combine Yahoo’s operations with AOL, a longtime Yahoo competitor acquired by Verizon last year. The idea is to use Yahoo’s vast array of content and its advertising technology to offer more robust services to Verizon customers and advertisers. Nintendo shares plunge, company says Pokemon GO's earnings impact limited: Shares of Nintendo Co (7974.T) tumbled as much as 18 percent early on Monday after the company said smash-hit mobile game Pokemon GO would have only a limited impact on its earnings. Nintendo said after the market closed on Friday that it had already factored in anticipated revenues from its Pokemon GO Plus device - an accessory worn on the wrist to alert players of nearby monsters to catch - and that it had no plans to revise its annual earnings forecasts for now. Nintendo said its affiliate Pokemon Co receives licensing and fees from the game's developer, Niantic Inc, and that profits at Nintendo from those revenues would be limited. The company, which owns 32 percent of Pokemon Co, is due to report first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The phenomenal success of Pokemon GO has triggered massive buying in Nintendo shares and even with Monday's decline, the shares are still up some 60 percent compared with levels prior to the game's July 6 launch in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.Startup Deal Activity Keeps Falling Worldwide: According to a new report from KPMG International and CB Insights, global deal activity for venture capital-backed startups continued a decline in the second quarter after hitting record levels one year ago. In fact, at the current rate, deal activity will just barely top 2013’s numbers. \"Many of the high-profile tech [initial public offerings] from 2015 continue to trade well below their initial offering price, putting pressure on private company valuations,\" said Brian Hughes of KPMG. \"This, combined with economic concerns in China and Europe, has continued to put a damper on VC investment.\" \"It's a challenging time for VC investors,\" he concluded.The reason funding moved higher while deal activity dropped is that some larger startups such as those of Snapchat Inc., Didi Chuxing, and Uber Technologies Inc. all saw huge rounds, accounting for much of the funding. In fact, in North America, Uber and Snapchat accounted for more than $4.5 billion of the $17.1 billion in total investment.And while there might have been more billion dollar companies minted in the second quarter than in the first, there were yet again more \"down events\"—companies raising new money or being acquired at a lower valuation—than there were unicorns created. According to the report, seven startups reached the unicorn club in the past four months, but CB Insights’ downround tracker shows that 17 failed to live up to expectations and experienced down events over that time. Unicorn creation saw its most recent peak in the third quarter of last year, when 25 were birthed.Roger Ailes created another big problem for Fox News — the average age of its audience is 68: Roger Ailes, the closest thing in modern U.S. politics to a kingmaker, today stepped down as head of Fox News, the network he founded 20 years ago and turned into a potent political force. James Murdoch and his brother Lachlan, both named by father Rupert to run parent company 21st Century Fox last year, pushed Ailes out on the heels of a sexual harassment suit that led to more allegations of sexual misconduct from female anchors. The brothers saw the situation as a way to remove a longstanding obstacle to their power within the company. A lot of the news reports — most of the key details were first broken by New York Magazine’s Gabriel Sherman — centered on how the 76-year-old, a lifelong Republican, clashed with the two brothers politically, personally and as an executive. Ailes is known as a venal operator, specializing in deals with questionable reciprocity. His style was completely at odds with James, a data-driven technocrat, and Lachlan, the earnest Murdoch member. Mostly true. A lesser-known but perhaps more important reason had to do with more practical issues — namely, the business of Fox News itself, according to sources. The average age of Fox News viewers in primetime, the hours that draw the highest ad rates and so are the ones that matter, is 68 — a group that advertisers don’t pay to reach. In the world of cable news, marketers really only pay for viewers in the 25-54 age range. That means a good chunk of Fox News’ audience is worth little to nothing. Fox News still mints money — it accounts for as much as 24 percent of the parent company’s yearly profit, or more than $1.5 billion — but a lot of that comes from licensing fees paid by distributors to carry the network, which are only negotiated every few years. Fox News still leads in total viewership and in primetime, but it can’t capitalize on a lot of that audience since advertisers don’t pay for a lot of these viewers. That weighed on the future value of the network, as James saw it, according to one person familiar with the matter, and as much as Ailes’s style and politics were issues for both brothers, the more pressing concern was managing for the future of the network, this source said.Reddit is still in turmoil: Its been one year since Reddit revolted When the company cracked down on revenge porn and subreddits containing offensive content last summer, the backlash was swift and ultimately led to the ouster of interim CEO Ellen Pao. Although Pao was seen as the driving force behind efforts to make Reddit respectable enough to appeal to advertisers, the company continued its clean-up after her departure, making diverse hires and keeping up with the anti-harassment policy instituted during Pao’s tenure. But Reddit, led by CEO Steve Huffman, seems to be struggling with its reform. Over the past six months, over a dozen senior Reddit employees — most of them women and people of color — have left the company. Reddit’s efforts to expand its media empire have also faltered. Reddit let go of at least two key members of its team earlier this week, several sources with knowledge of Reddit confirmed to TechCrunch. Among those who lost their jobs are Reddit’s vice president of marketing, Celestine Maddy and Reddit’s editorial director, Vickie Chang. Also this week, Reddit HR generalist Nicole-Jasmin Clark left the company, according to our sources and confirmed by her LinkedIn, as well as a handful of people from the marketing team. The layoffs follow departures from the network’s video team last month, and the slow trickle of employees exiting the company over the past several months. Back in May, Reddit lost its head of community, Kristine Fasnacht, after being in the role for just nine months. In short, female and POC employees have been quietly leaving the company — by way of layoffs and resignations — from many departments, including engineering, marketing, operations and product. Reddit’s associate creative director Stephen Greenwood also left the company in June. sources say Reddit’s internal turmoil can be traced back to the company’s ongoing struggle to leave its antagonistic culture behind. Several employees fended off uncomfortable comments from users and management alike, sources claimed. “Management is terrible, a complete reflection of what the site is like,” one source said. Another source, a former Reddit employee who asked to remain anonymous described a management team with good intentions but poor execution.One individual speculated that the reemergence of the company’s drinking culture was to blame for the uncomfortable environment. Under Pao’s reign, Reddit tried to eradicate the bro-like amount of alcohol consumption at the office, but that went right out the window following Pao’s departure in July 2015.Visa and PayPal have finally settled a long-standing feud: Two months ago, Visa’s CEO issued a thinly veiled threat to PayPal: Stop driving business away from us or risk increased competition like you’ve never seen. He got his wish. The two payment companies just announced a wide-ranging partnership that includes a promise from PayPal to stop steering Visa cardholders away from using their Visa cards for PayPal transactions. The new accord will also enable PayPal’s mobile app to work as a payment option in brick-and-mortar stores whose equipment accepts tap-and-pay Visa payments. The partnership appears to bring to a close tension between one of the world’s biggest credit companies and the biggest alternative online payment option in the U.S. PayPal has been viewed warily by the credit card companies that don’t appreciate PayPal pushing their customers to pay with a bank account hookup — known as ACH — rather than a payment card. PayPal historically makes more money on a transaction when a user funds his or her PayPal wallet with a direct bank account hookup, since that method carries lower transaction fees than payment cards do.“The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume, and greater long-term Visa fee certainty,” according to the press release. Translation: Visa is paying PayPal for increasing the amount of PayPal transactions that flow through Visa pipes. It appears PayPal is also getting a promise that Visa will not raise the fees it charges PayPal when a PayPal customer uses a Visa card to make a PayPal purchase. But it still appears likely that the deal will eat into PayPal’s profits as more Visa customers choose to pay with cards through PayPal instead of bank accounts, according to Craig Maurer, an analyst with Autonomous Research. “Yes, PayPal will get some form of incentives from Visa, but we believe the off-set will be minimal while this drag will be material,” he wrote in research note to clients.Dollar Shave Club hit the jackpot when Unilever agreed to buy the online men's razor merchant for $1 billion. Other e-commerce startups such as Birchbox and Stitch Fix can't necessarily expect their own suitor to sweep in with such sweet deals. That's because the key to Dollar Shave Club's appeal is not so much its online prowess but the fact that it built a powerful brand in four years.  Dollar Shave Club upended the industry's traditional business model by offering a subscription service that sells blades for as little as $3 a month (including shipping and handling). The day Dollar Shave Club started selling subscriptions in March 2012, the company released a YouTube video starring founder Michael Dubin. He tells viewers the product is f***ing great, \"so gentle a toddler could use it.\" The website crashed, but the blades sold out in six hours. The video has been viewed about 23 million times. The company reached $150 million-plus in sales in 2015, Unilever said in a press release announcing the deal. That despite the fact that the blades lack many of Gillette's high-tech enhancements. Few other e-commerce startups can claim to have built a brand so quickly. Unilever and P&G are masters at traditional marketing, mostly offline, but they struggle with the direct-to-consumer brand-building at which upstarts like Dollar Shave Club excel.Uber Investors Said to Push for Didi Truce in Costly China Fight: Uber Technologies Inc. investors have a message for management: It’s time to wrap up the costly fight in China. Several institutional investors are pushing the ride-hailing company to ink a partnership agreement with China’s market leader Didi Chuxing, according to people familiar with the matter, stemming the billions of dollars Uber is spending to expand in the region.Uber and Didi are bleeding cash in China as they fight for dominance in the world’s most populous country. Uber has said that it is spending at least $1 billion a year to expand its business in the country. Both are giving out incentives for drivers and free rides to compete for market share.Benchmark’s Bill Gurley -- an Uber investor and board member -- spoke briefly with Didi President Jean Liu at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, a few months ago, according to a person familiar with the matter. Didi is in the lead on its home turf, with 14 million drivers signed up in 400 Chinese cities. Uber has set a target of operating in 100 cities this year. Uber set up a separate corporate entity to insulate its Chinese business, which has gathered local Chinese investors. Still, the parent company has also invested its own money, keeping the units financially intertwined. Among private technology companies, the rivals are giants. Uber, which was last valued at nearly $68 billion, says it has access to more than $11 billion in cash and equity. Didi, which was last valued at $28 billion, says it has more than $10 billion at its disposal in cash and equity.Google has found a business model for its most advanced artificial intelligence: Two years ago, Google spent over half a billion dollars for the tiny artificial intelligence startup DeepMind. Since then, the unit has walloped Atari video games and beaten an impossible board game. Impressive stuff, that. But those AI demonstrations have yet to spell actual revenue. Until now — although the efforts are helping Google save money on its most expensive part. DeepMind chief Demis Hassabis told Bloomberg that his unit recently began applying its advanced AI to Google’s data centers, finding ways to reduce the company’s sizable energy bill. Google started using machine learning for its data centers two years ago, searching for ways to reduce costs for one of the company’s top expenses. A month ago, it aimed the more specialized AI tools from DeepMind at the problem of cooling these server farms. That cut the energy needed for cooling by 40 percent, the company said. It didn’t offer a dollar figure for that, but it’s safe to assume that it means hundreds of millions in savings over the long haul.DeepMind technically sits outside of Google in Alphabet. (I’ve heard people describe it as in the “Alphaverse,” whatever that means.) But a rep said that Google was not paying DeepMind for its cost-cutting research here.What is ARM and why is SoftBank spending $32 billion on it? SoftBank’s $32 billion deal to buy chip designer ARM had many people scratching their heads Monday. It’s not that ARM isn’t important in tech. Indeed, its processor designs are used by nearly every chipmaker and, by extension, find a place inside nearly every piece of tech from cellphones to hard drives to networking gear. Rather, it is the fact that the chipmaker is so far removed from SoftBank’s other businesses. The Japanese conglomerate has a wide range of tech holdings, including a controlling interest in Sprint, its own mobile carrier business in Japan and investments in Alibaba, OlaCabs and Snapdeal. “SoftBank would have been one of the least likely I thought to buy ARM,” said longtime chip analyst Kevin Krewell of Tirias Research. “They are not in the semiconductor business in any significant way.” Krewell says he suspects that SoftBank looked hard at buying other companies in the chip business and decided that ARM was the strongest play, especially for the very long term.It’s worth taking a second to understand how ARM’s business works and what it does. ARM doesn’t make any products. Not only does it not manufacture chips, it doesn’t even design the ones that are eventually sold. Rather, it designs the core engines that get built into others’ chips — chips from companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia as well as processors like Apple’s A9 and Samsung’s Exynos. For its efforts, ARM gets a small license fee from every chip that uses its design. Because it is in so many products, that small license fee adds up to a pretty healthy business. Its 2015 revenue was nearly one billion British pounds. And its sphere of influence is growing, both in terms of the number of chips using its design as well as the kinds of products. Last year nearly 15 billion chips using its designs were sold, up from about six billion in 2010. Cars, servers and internet-of-things devices are all seen as big expansion areas for ARM chips.SoftBank is bidding to buy ARM for $32 billion — because everything’s a computer now: apan’s SoftBank is buying U.K.-based chip design firm ARM Holdings for about $32 billion, according to the FT. Why? Everything is a computer now, and ARM has been one of the winners of the mobile revolution. ARM designs chips — but doesn’t actually make them — for a huge variety of devices. It dominates the market for smartphones — Apple is a big client, as is Samsung — and its chips shows up in other consumer gadgets, as well as more-industrial-like devices and “internet of things” sensors. The number of chips containing ARM processors reached almost 15 billion in 2015, up from about 6 billion in 2010.The move is a big one for SoftBank CEO Masa Son after his would-be successor, former Google executive Nikesh Arora, stepped away from the company last month. (Talks presumably started while Arora was still there.) One key question is whether other firms will let SoftBank purchase ARM or if there will be a bidding war. Apple, arguably ARM’s most important client, and Intel, which lost the mobile chip war to ARM, are both potential buyers.ATMs Spit Out Cash Without Cards as Smartphone Apps Take Over:  Forgot your bank card at home? No worries. Many ATMs will soon dispense cash with help from a smartphone and banking app. A growing number of banks are letting consumers arrange withdrawals via their mobile app and pick up the cash at a nearby automated teller machine. Customers authenticate the transaction by scanning a QR code with their phone, entering a one-time security code or tapping their device on the machine. The idea is to help customers who have forgotten their cards or worry about thieves stealing their card data via ATMs. While so-called cardless cash access is only available at about 2,000 of the half a million or so U.S. ATMs in use today, it’s expanding rapidly and will be at as many as 95,000 machines by year end, according to payments researcher Crone Consulting LLC. JPMorgan Chase & Co. plans to roll out the feature later this year. Bank of America Corp.said it will extend the technology to 5,000 ATMs by year end. And Wells Fargo & Co. is letting some users of mobile wallets like Apple Pay authenticate through their phone, and expects more than 40 percent of its ATMs to be enabled for this technology by year end. In possibly the largest deployment to date, Payment Alliance International, the nation’s largest closely held provider of ATM processing and maintenance services, plans to announce Friday that it will start rolling out the technology in August or September, and plans to have cardless cash access at 25,000 machines in stores and gas stations by the end of 2017.The technology has cut transaction times at ATMs to about 10 seconds from 45 seconds, he said, adding that more than 8 percent of the bank’s mobile customers use the service. Smartphone-based ATM transactions have also helped combat skimming, where criminals insert a device in an ATM that steals customers’ credentials and lets them make withdrawals later. Last year, the number of ATMs compromised by criminals in the U.S. jumped 546 percent, according to FICO Card Alert Service. Upgrading an ATM with software for such smartphone-based withdrawals cost about $800, Ormseth said.Artificial Intelligence Swarms Silicon Valley on Wings and Wheels: For more than a decade, Silicon Valley’s technology investors and entrepreneurs obsessed over social media and mobile apps that helped people do things like find new friends, fetch a ride home or crowdsource a review of a product or a movie. Now Silicon Valley has found its next shiny new thing. And it does not have a “Like” button. The new era in Silicon Valley centers on artificial intelligenceand robots, a transformation that many believe will have a payoff on the scale of the personal computing industry or the commercial internet, two previous generations that spread computing globally. Computers have begun to speak, listen and see, as well as sprout legs, wings and wheels to move unfettered in the world. The shift was evident in a Lowe’s home improvement store here this month, when a prototype inventory checker developed by Bossa Nova Robotics silently glided through the aisles using computer vision to automatically perform a task that humans have done manually for centuries. The robot, which was skilled enough to autonomously move out of the way of shoppers and avoid unexpected obstacles in the aisles, alerted people to its presence with soft birdsong chirps. Gliding down the middle of an aisle at a leisurely pace, it can recognize bar codes on shelves, and it uses a laser to detect which items are out of stock.Success of Pokemon GO adds impetus for change at Nintendo: The phenomenal success of Pokemon GO and the surge in Nintendo Co's (7974.T) market value by $17 billion in just over a week has been seized upon by one of its most vocal investors to press for a change of strategy at the company. Until Pokemon GO, a mobile game, was launched just over a week ago, Nintendo had taken every opportunity to say its main focus was still gaming consoles, and games for smartphones were just a means to lure more people to them. But the success of Pokemon GO - unforseen even by its creators - has shown the potential for augmented reality and for Nintendo to capitalize on a line-up of popular characters ranging from Zelda to Super Mario. Seth Fischer, founder and chief investment officer at Oasis Management, is one of Asia's best known hedge fund managers and has long been a small but loud shareholder. Encouraged by the success of mobile games like \"Candy Crush\", he has campaigned for years for the Japanese console maker to develop and sell games for platforms run by Apple and Google. \"I hope they will now understand the power of smartphones,\" Fischer told Reuters. \"And as a result, I hope this means there is a whole change in strategy.\" \"My next focus with Nintendo is for them to focus on monetizing the rest of their 4,000 patents for mobile gaming, multi-player gaming, et cetera. I think they could be making 30 to 60 billion yen ($290 million to $570 million) annually from licensing.\"Line Rises in Initial Public Offering, Cheering Skittish Tech Industry: The Line Corporation, the owner of a Japanese instant messaging app with a colorful cast of cartoon characters, cheered the technology industry on Thursday when its shares jumped 30 percent in their American trading debut. The strong showing offers hope for tech firms and their financial backers that Wall Street investors are warming up to closely held technology start-ups. But experts say Line is an unusual case of an established company with operating heft and a proven way to gin up sales — something that many new tech companies lack. Line itself still faces considerable hurdles, such as slowing user growth and an untested plan to use advertising to help make it profitable. Line’s American depositary shares, priced at $32.84 each on Monday, jumped to $42.70 in early trading in New York on Thursday. The stock is expected to begin trading in Japan on Friday. Line’s debut coincided with another new high for the equity markets in the United States. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has surged 8 percent since June 27, after Britain’s decision to leave the European Union roiled stocks worldwide, as investors anticipated additional stimulus from central banks.Zendesk’s “Automatic Answers” taps machine learning, AI to generate bot-style email responses: Chat bots have ballooned in popularity in recent months, and now we’re seeing some interesting examples of how that technology, where computers interact and respond to human requests, is being used to solve other problems. Today,Zendesk is taking the wraps off “Automatic Answers”, a service for businesses to reply to emails from customers without ever having a human employee get involved. Automatic Answers is not your average, run-of-the mill email autoresponder. The service was built using a machine learning platform that Zendesk’s in-house teams of data scientists and engineers, which are based out of Melbourne, Australia, have been developing on for a while now. That machine learning platform was first announced last year and it also powers a service Zendesk announced last October, Satisfaction Prediction, which is able to monitor customer-company interactions to — as its name implies — determine whether the customer is getting what she or he needs. The machine learning/AI element means that the responses in Automatic Answers are not only reading and responding specifically to what you the customer is asking, but it is technically getting smarter with each response (and presumably using a bit of Satisfaction Prediction to figure out if it’s getting it right). Automatic Answers will work first in email because, as Zendesk’s VP of product Sam Boonin tells me, “Even in a world of customer services embedded in every communication channel from social to web to phone, email still represents the majority of interactions that are coming in.”No more Tesla buyback guarantee as company cuts price of Model X: Tesla Motors Inc has ended a program that guaranteed the resale value of its cars, and lowered the starting price of its Model X crossover, the high-profile electric vehicle maker said on Wednesday. The discontinuation of the buyback program, as of July 1, allows Tesla to free up cash that had been set aside to buy back Model S cars after three years at a value of at least 50 percent of the base purchase price. The changes come after Tesla warned earlier this month it will miss its vehicle delivery target for a second consecutive quarter.It faces other challenges, including a regulatory investigation of its Autopilot technology following a May 7 fatal crash and more scrutiny of its financials after a proposed merger with SolarCity Corp. Within the next 12 months, Tesla has disclosed it could pay a maximum of $192.4 million to cover resale value guarantees on 4,209 vehicles. That amounts to a maximum liability of $45,711 per car, although Tesla could offset payouts by reselling repurchased vehicles. Tesla valued the total liability created by the resale value guarantee at $1.58 billion as of March 31, according to its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, up over 20 percent since the end of 2015. The program, begun in 2013, was intended to help Tesla control its secondary market and reassure buyers purchasing vehicles using its novel technology that resale values wouldn't drop substantially. A Tesla spokesperson said the program was discontinued to \"keep interest rates as low as possible and offer a compelling lease and loan program to customers.\" In effect, Tesla is now doing what most established auto makers do: allow market forces to set trade-in values.EU-U.S. commercial data transfer pact enters into force: A new commercial data pact between the European Union and the United States entered into force on Tuesday, ending months of uncertainty over cross-border data flows, and companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft can sign up from Aug. 1. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield will give businesses moving personal data across the Atlantic - from human resources information to people's browsing histories to hotel bookings - an easy way to do so without falling foul of tough EU data transferral rules. The previous such framework, Safe Harbour, was struck down by the EU's top court in October on the grounds that it allowed U.S. agents too much access to Europeans' data. Revelations three years ago from former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass U.S. surveillance practices caused political outrage in Europe and stoked mistrust of big U.S. tech companies. In the months that followed the EU ruling companies have had to rely on other more cumbersome mechanisms for legally transferring data to the United States. The Privacy Shield will underpin over $250 billion dollars of transatlantic trade in digital services annually. Google and Microsoft said they would sign up to the Privacy Shield and would work with European data protection authorities in case of inquiries. A person familiar with social network Facebook's thinking said the company had not yet decided whether to sign up.Google just scored a bunch of new property to make its crazy dream campus come true: Google couldn’t score LinkedIn’s business. But it’s getting LinkedIn’s real estate. On Tuesday, the two companies announced a large, surprising property swap encompassing over three million square feet of existing and future real estate, including LinkedIn’s corporate headquarters. The companies wouldn’t share financial terms, but they said neither side paid a premium for the properties. From Google, LinkedIn is picking up seven buildings, a plan it said will consolidate its staff around its Sunnyvale and Mountain View Calif., offices. The company said the deal is unrelated to its recent Microsoft acquisition. In return, Google is getting LinkedIn’s Mountain View headquarters office and — far more critical for the internet giant — four different surrounding properties that enable Google to follow through on its ambitious plan for a new, green, crazy-futurist campus. But here’s the kernel: Google proposed the aforementioned crazy-futurist campus in early 2015. It was a big deal; the “genius” architect behind it got a magazine cover. Then LinkedIn spoiled the fun: Mountain View’s city council voted last May to cede the property to LinkedIn, blocking Google’s grand vision. But now the runway for Google is clear.The non-gamer’s guide to playing Pokemon Go: Pokemon Go is a full-blown phenomenon, with millions of downloads and excitement only growing after players got through their first weekend of being real-life Pokemon trainers. The game is heavy on fun but light on explanations -- particularly if you're so excited to start playing that you blitz through the opening tutorial. So maybe you've downloaded it, fired it up and then gotten, well, completely lost. If you're completely mystified by how this game actually works, here are some basics to get you out there and catching Pokemon in no time.Once you download the app, you'll be asked to sign in. You can sign in using an existing Google account. Or, if you're not so keen to connect your Pokemon identity to your Google identity, then you can also sign up with the Pokemon Trainer Club, which is an account with the Pokemon Co. From there, you design your character and pick your first Pokemon. Then you can get going! And you will have to actually get going. The whole selling point of the game is to walk around the real world to find the cute little critters. This not only encourages you to explore your own city, but also -- gasp! -- gets you outside and around other people. In fact, this is not really a game you can play while stationary. Sometimes Pokemon will come to you, but more often than not you have to go to them.The SEC is investigating whether Tesla should have told its investors about a fatal crash: The Securities Exchange Commission is opening an investigation into Tesla to determine whether the company should have told shareholders earlier about a fatal crash related to its autonomous driving tech, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. Joshua Brown was killed on May 7 when his Tesla, operating in Autopilot mode, drove into a tractor-trailer that that was crossing the highway. Autopilot is a semi-autonomous driving technology that’s a much more sophisticated version of cruise control. Weeks later, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into the accident to determine whether the technology worked as expected. This SEC probe, on the other hand, is not about the technology; it’s about whether, under securities law, Tesla should have told its investors about the accident and when. A Tesla spokesperson said the company had not received any communication from the SEC as yet.) The results of the SEC probe will set a precedent for the auto industry as more automakers roll out their own versions of Autopilot. The 2017 Mercedes Benz E class will be equipped with semi-autonomous technology called Drive Pilot; Volvo’s XC90 already has semi-autonomous technology called Pilot Assist; and General Motor’s Super Cruise technology is expected to become available in the 2017 Cadillac CT6. Automakers typically don’t disclose to investors every single accident in which their vehicles are involved. If, however, the SEC determines that Tesla should have disclosed this accident to its investors, that may all change.What is Pokémon Go and why is everybody talking about it?: This new Pokémon game is bringing augmented reality mainstream.It’s a new mobile game, free on both iOS and Android, that lets you create an avatar that can catch, train, trade and battle Pokémon characters inside the game. That sounds familiar. Isn’t that the premise of virtually every other Pokémon game? Yes, kinda. What makes this game unique is that it uses your phone’s location services and camera so that you can catch Pokémon in real life. That is, when you walk around the streets of whatever city or town you live in, your avatar moves inside the game. So finding new Pokémon and checkpoints for the game actually requires you to get off the couch and walk down the block. How does this work? The game uses Google Maps technology to place your avatar on a virtual world that mirrors your real life surroundings. When you find a Pokémon, the game uses augmented reality (AR) to make it look like whatever Pokémon you’ve stumbled across is indeed standing right there in front of you. Who created Pokémon Go? Nintendo and the other creators of Pokémon teamed up with Niantic Labs to create the game. The former company was born inside Google; its founder, John Hanke, was a key leader of its Geo products (Google Maps, Earth). After moving to leave Google in 2010, Hanke was lured to stay with funding for Niantic, a skunkworks project to build mobile AR tools using Google Maps technology. Niantic’s first effort, Ingress — an augmented-reality, massively multiplayer, location-based online game — cultivated a small but very dedicated following. Niantic spun out of Google in the fall, yet the search giant stayed involved, participating in a $30 million investment for developing Pokémon Go.Nintendo shares surge on Pokemon mobile game hopes: Shares of Japan's Nintendo Co soared more than 20 percent in early Tokyo trading on Monday, extending last week's gains, on hopes that the popularity of its new Pokemon GO smartphone game will boost its results. Pokemon GO was launched in the United States last week and shot to the No. 1 free app in Apple Inc's U.S. iTunes store. It was also launched in Australia and New Zealand, and is expected to be rolled out in Japan soon. Nintendo shares were up 23.5 percent at 20,085 yen ($199.32) each after earlier rising as high as 20,190 yen, their highest since November.Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos Is Barred From Running Lab for 2 Years: Federal regulators have barred Elizabeth Holmes, chief executive of Theranos, from owning or operating a medical laboratory for at least two years, raising new questions about the future of the embattled blood-testing start-up and its founder, once a Silicon Valley phenomenon. In a letter sent to Theranos that was made public on Friday, regulators said they were revoking the certification of its flagship laboratory in Newark, Calif., effective Sept. 5. They also said the laboratory would be prohibited from taking Medicare and Medicaid payments. The government scrutiny stemmed from questions about the effectiveness of Theranos’s technology and the way the company operated its labs. The company faces a fine of $10,000 for every day it is out of compliance with regulations, effective July 12. Such stern sanctions are “virtually unheard-of in my 40 years’ experience in the industry,” said David Nichols, president of the Nichols Management Group, a consultant to and operator of clinical laboratories. “I don’t see a path forward for the company.” What Theranos and Ms. Holmes will do next is not clear. The company said in its statement that it would continue to operate a laboratory it owns in Arizona, at least for now. But if the license of the California lab is indeed revoked, then Ms. Holmes and Theranos could not own or operate any laboratory, and the Arizona facility would also have to be shut, according to both Theranos and a spokesman for the regulator.Japan's Line sets top price for up to $1.3 billion IPO: Line Corp set the price for its initial public offering at the top of its marketing range, raising up to $1.3 billion, a regulatory filing showed on Monday, reflecting robust appetite for the Japanese messaging app firm. The company set the IPO price at 3,300 yen per share, compared with its book-building range of 2,900-3,300 yen. It had initially set the range at 2,700-3,200 yen but bumped it up last week. Including an over-allotment arrangement, Line will sell up to 132.8 billion yen ($1.3 billion) of shares. Line, owned by South Korea's Naver Corp, plans to list in New York on July 14 and in Tokyo the following day.Uber Is Said to Close $1.15 Billion High-Yield Leveraged Loan: Uber Technologies Inc. closed a $1.15 billion high-yield leveraged loan, a person familiar with the matter said, bringing the total equity and debt raised by the ride-hailing mobile app to more than $15 billion. Bloomberg reported last month that Uber was seeking to raise $1 billion to $2 billion in debt. Morgan Stanley, Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. facilitated the deal. Creditors will receive about a 5 percent yield on the loan, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t public.India's $4 Smartphone Seems Too Good to Be True: A little-known Indian company called Ringing Bells Pvt is set to start shipping the Freedom 251. The prototype touts a quad-core processor, a 4-inch screen and front and back cameras - at the astonishingly low price of 251 rupees (less than $4). While global brands Samsung Electronics Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. sell devices for less than $100, the $4 smartphone is the one stirring up the internet-hungry, app-crazy hordes in a country where Apple Inc. has been unable to make a dent. With iPhones costing upwards of $700, Apple commands a mere 2 percent market share in a country where the World Bank puts the per capita income at $5,630. Brands can't make money even on $50 smartphones, so profiting from a $4 device is a ludicrous idea, say experts like Tarun Pathak, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Technology Market Research. While Micromax sells millions of cheap devices every month in smaller cities - it profits by taking advantage of economies of scale. Ringing Bells’ managing director Mohit Goel isn't counting on a profit from device sales, conceding that the company will lose hundreds of rupees on each unit, and is instead planning to recoup money through advertising and marketing deals. Goel has said the company is importing kits from Taiwan and assembling the phones in a factory in Haridwar near Delhi.Even at $4, the smartphone could still be out of reach for most because of scarcity. When Goel first announced Freedom 251 in February, the company said over 70 million jostled to register, crashing its website. Last week he said Ringing Bells will soon start shipping 200,000 smartphones to buyers picked by lottery. Other details were not available and e-mails, phone calls and text messages to Goel and his representatives in the past days went unanswered. Selling such a cheap device has attracted scrutiny along with the publicity. The prototype Freedom 251 presented to the media turned out to be produced by another manufacturer with its logos covered. Thwarted buyers protested outside the company’s headquarters, setting off inquiries by the police and tax officials. Pankaj Mahindroo, president of the Indian Cellular Association, with members including Apple and Samsung, said “We are concerned and keeping a close watch.”Another Tesla crash is under investigation to see if Autopilot is at fault: U.S. transportation regulators are opening a new probe of a Tesla car crash, one week afterannouncing an investigation into a fatal crash of a Tesla operating in the company’s semi-autonomous driving mode. The new investigation involves a non-fatal crash on July 1 in Pennsylvania. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration will try to determine if the Tesla’s Autopilot functions were active at the time. The additional investigation will likely intensify scrutiny around the safety and design of Tesla’s Autopilot product, which provides some self-driving features as a software update. Zomato's Results: For the year ending March 2016, Zomato posted revenues of Rs 87.5 crore for the India region, up from Rs 46 crore revenues in 2015. India accounted for 47.3% of Zomato's overall revenues that stood at 184.97 crore for FY16. The net loss for the India region however shot up to Rs 247 crore for the fiscal, up more than three times from Rs 62.3 crore loss in 2015. This is nearly half of Zomato's overall net loss of Rs 574.5 crore in FY16.In the US market that accounts for nearly 50% of its listings, the Gurugram-based company posted a net loss of Rs 327.5 crore on revenues of Rs 6.73 crore for the fiscal. This is a massive increase from Rs 33 crore on revenues of Rs 5.1 crore in 2015. Zomato had forayed into United States last year with the $52 million UrbanSpoon acquisition that was eventually folded into the company.In terms of segments, Online advertising still dominates Zomato's revenues, accounting for 91.4% of the company's overall revenues. The segment's revenues grew by 76.1% to Rs 169.1 crore for FY16, from Rs 96 crore in FY15. Revenues from online ordering was at Rs 7.5 crore for the fiscal, accounting for nearly 4% of the company's revenues. Goyal had recently said that 20% of its India revenues came from the ordering business in April this year. Subscription revenues grew to Rs 8.4 crore from Rs 0.64 crore in 2015. This includes revenues from its business app from restaurants and its Whitelabel platform among others.Samsung Set to Boost Spending as S7 Revives Smartphone Fortunes: After ending a two-year smartphone slide with the Galaxy S7, Samsung Electronics Co. could be about to hike capital spending to sustain a revival across the company. At least $5 billion more of investment is headed to the display and semiconductor businesses, according to a survey of analyst estimates, to help Samsung ride out bumps in the phone market. Such a move reflects new optimism about the company after the success of the Galaxy S7, with the shares rallying 17 percent this year.“Samsung’s smartphone business has finally had a soft landing after a bumpy ride,” said Chung Chang Won, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Seoul. Samsung will probably boost spending on memory and displays, which “are poised for a sudden rise as the next growth drivers.”But with growth in the global smartphone market evaporating, it needs to build up its other major businesses as competitors bring out new products in an attempt to spark growth.BookMyShow secures $81.5 mn from Stripes Group, others: Movie ticketing platform BookMyShow has raised Rs 550 crore ($81.5 million) from existing and new investors in one of the largest funding rounds for an Indian consumer Internet firm in recent months. BookMyShow’s Mumbai-based parent Bigtree Entertainment Pvt Ltd. said on Tuesday it raised the Series C funding round from investors led by New York-based investment firm Stripes Group. Existing investors Network 18, Accel Partners and SAIF Partners also took part in this round. This round takes the total amount the company has raised to $128 million (Rs 863 crore), making it one of the most heavily funded firms in the media and entertainment sector. The company last raised $25 million (Rs 150 crore) from SAIF Partners, Accel Partners and Network18 in 2014.The latest funding round values the Indian company at $445 million (Rs 3,000 crore), The Economic Times reported citing company sources.The latest funding round values the Indian company at $445 million (Rs 3,000 crore), The Economic Times reported citing company sources.Five days of Etsy payment processing outages have merchants flipping: Those hoping to snag some handmade July 4th cookies and home-made vegan sunblockmight have woken up to an empty stomach and sunburn after a serious payment processing outage on e-commerce site Etsy. Over the last five days, a large number of Etsy transactions have been disrupted by “third party” payment processing outages. As of 6pm PST July 5th, over 4,000 messages of frustration have been posted in the company’s Bugs Community Forum. After the Direct Checkout outage, many merchants were left with their hands in their laps explaining delays to buyers. The outage is especially tough for sellers who have to face angry customers. It’s all too easy for an unhappy buyer to blame the seller in a negative review for an outage out of their control.Salesforce Pushed Microsoft to Up LinkedIn Bid Before Deal: Salesforce.com Inc. battled Microsoft Corp. for LinkedIn Corp. deep into the negotiating process, forcing the world’s largest software maker to boost its offer to buy the professional-networking service just days before the $26 billion deal was announced. Three other companies were involved in the discussions, which lasted almost four months, according to a regulatory filing Friday. One of those was Facebook Inc., which passed on an acquisition, according to a person involved in the negotiations. Microsoft increased its offer to $196 a share June 11, from $182 a share earlier, after the other main bidder offered \"approximately $200\" a share for the company, the filing said. The board ultimately decided the Microsoft offer was stronger in part because it was an all-cash deal, while the other bidder was offering to pay with its stock and cash, the filing said.There were other companies that expressed interest in acquiring LinkedIn, or were involved in the process. Those were referred to as Parties B, C and D in the filing. Recode reported Friday that Party B was Google, the internet search business of Alphabet Inc., and Party D was Facebook, operator of the largest social network.Tesla crash raises concerns about autonomous vehicle regulation: The fatal crash of a Tesla Motors Inc Model S in Autopilot mode has turned up pressure on auto industry executives and regulators to ensure that automated driving technology is deployed safely. The first such known accident, which occurred in Florida in May, has highlighted tensions surrounding efforts to turn over responsibility for braking, steering and driving judgments to machines. It may delay the U.S. government's plan to outline guidelines for self-driving cars this month. The cause of the Model S crash is still under investigation by federal and Florida state authorities, which are looking into whether the driver was distracted before his 2015 Model S went under a truck trailer. Shares of Tesla and Mobileye NV, the maker of the camera vision system used in the Model S, rose on Friday as analysts said the accident was likely a short-term setback. The stocks fell in after-hours trading on Thursday after an investigation of the crash was made known.Why Tech Support Is (Purposely) Unbearable: “Don’t think companies haven’t studied how far they can take things in providing the minimal level of service,” Mr. Robbins said. “Some organizations have even monetized it by intentionally engineering it so you have to wait an hour at least to speak to someone in support, and while you are on hold, you’re hearing messages like, ‘If you’d like premium support, call this number and for a fee, we will get to you immediately.’” The most egregious offenders are companies like cable and mobile service providers, which typically have little competition and whose customers are bound by contracts or would be considerably inconvenienced if they canceled their service. Not surprisingly, cable and mobile service providers are consistently ranked by consumers as providing the worst customer support.Of course, companies rated best for tech support often charge more for their products or they may charge a subscription fee for enhanced customer care so the cost of helping you is baked in, as with Apple’s customer support service, AppleCare, and theAmazon Prime subscription service.Zenefits halves its previous valuation to $2B to head off investor lawsuits: Zenefits is executing a change in its current ownership structure that will increase the overall ownership of the company for late-stage investors; it’s a move that revalues the company’s Series C round at $2 billion and looks to placate investor concerns over the company’s regulatory investigations. As part of accepting the new ownership changes, the investors participating will sign a release of claims against the company. It’s another move that new CEO David Sacks is doing in what’s been a massive cleanup effort of the company following report after report of the company skirting insurance regulation. Since all those regulatory issues came to light, the company has laid off more than 350 employees and parted ways with its former CEO Parker Conrad. The biggest issue stemmed from a program called “The Macro” that would aid in circumventing state licensing requirements.All this is basically a way to reset expectations for investors, as well as try to retain employees following the changes in the company’s ownership structure. Shareholders were kept in the dark in relation to the existence and use of “The Macro,” which required a reset of the relationship. Zenefits grew like a rocket ship, reaching a $4.5 billion valuation in just about two years after the company started. That, at the time, labeled the company as one of the fastest-growing SaaS startups ever — but, obviously, there was a bunch of shady stuff going on behind the scenes to pad that growth.Apple is in “exploratory talks” to acquire Tidal, the streaming music service run by Jay-Z, the Wall Street Journal reports. Recode has confirmed that the companies are discussing a deal. The fact that Tidal, which has been shopping itself for some time, is now talking to a buyer with incredibly deep pockets — and a streaming service — is not a surprise. One thing seems certain: This is a different situation from when Tim Cook, Eddy Cue and companypaid $3 billion for Beats two years ago. Then, it was acquiring several executives, including Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, plus the Beats Music team and a hardware business that was selling lots of expensive headphones. Tidal, on the other hand, has much less to offer: Tidal has about four million paying subscribers, according to the WSJ. (For context, Apple Music has 15 million.) Those can’t automatically be moved over to Apple Music, but Apple should be able to persuade many of them to come over. It has whatever Jay-Z brings to the table for consumer marketing and artist relationships. Perhaps most importantly, a deal would take Tidal off the market as a competitor for artist exclusives, which have created much of its buzz. This presumably means Apple wouldn’t have to worry about not being able to stream the new Beyoncé album, for example. (Though Tidal’s artist and label deals will likely expire upon acquisition, as is typical.) Apple also probably doesn’t have much competition for this deal, so it would be in a strong position. Samsung, the most logical buyer, walked away from its earlier talks with Tidal, according to a source close to the deal. Spotify can’t afford it. Google, which also owns a streaming service, could possibly also be interested for similar reasons as Apple. All this is worth something, but not a ton.Oracle ordered to pay HP $3 billion in Itanium case: A California jury ordered Oracle  to pay Hewlett-Packard $3 billion in damages in a case over HP's Itanium servers, an Oracle spokeswoman said on Thursday. Oracle said it would appeal the verdict. The Itaniuum processor is made by Intel. Oracle decided to stop developing software for use with HP's Itanium-based servers in 2011, saying that Intel made it clear that the chip was nearing the end of its life and was shifting its focus to its x86 microprocessor. But HP said it had an agreement with Oracle that support for Itanium would continue, without which the equipment using the chip would become obsolete.\"HP is gratified by the jury's verdict, which affirms what HP has always known and the evidence overwhelmingly showed,\" John Schultz, executive vice president and general counsel of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, said in an e-mailed statement, saying that Oracle's decision to stop the software development \"was a clear breach of contract.\"Landing with a bump? Germany's Rocket falls back to earth: When German e-commerce investor Rocket Internet launched Jumia in 2012 as a would-be African Amazon, it was optimistic that a rapidly expanding middle class would quickly shift from street markets to shopping online. Four years on, falling sales for sites like Jumia and slower growth from Nigeria to Russia and Brazil is casting doubt on Rocket Internet's ambition to become the world's biggest Internet company outside the United States and China. Jumia made a loss of 17 million euros ($18.8 million) in the first three months of 2016 on sales that fell more than a third. The devaluation of Nigeria's naira last week is a new blow for Jumia, which now operates in more than 20 countries in Africa. Revenue growth has also slowed at most of Rocket Internet's other 11 leading start-ups, ranging from furniture e-commerce and food delivery in Europe to online fashion in markets from India to Latin America and the Middle East. That is the consequence of Rocket's shift to rein in spending on marketing and logistics as it seeks to stem losses which it said peaked at 1 billion euros in 2015. As a result, shareholders have cast doubt on the valuation Rocket has put on its portfolio and questioned the strategy of sending business school graduates to set up 150 start-ups in more than 110 countries in just a few years. Exclusive interviews with shareholders reveal growing scepticism about Rocket's sprawling empire as emerging markets sour and technology stocks cool. Its share price has fallen 39 percent this year.Google Capital Makes First Public Company Investment in Care.com. Shares in Care.com Inc soared 18 percent in extended trading, after the home care provider announced a $46.35 million investment from Google Capital, the growth equity arm of Alphabet Inc. Google Capital’s investment makes it the largest shareholder in Care.com, and Laela Sturdy, a partner at the fund, will join the company’s board, Care.com said Wednesday in a statement. The company provides child, adult, senior, pet and home-care services and had a market capitalization of $276 million as of Wednesday. Google Capital was founded in 2013 and has invested in numerous private companies. It pairs its companies with advisers spread across Alphabet, and in the last six months has tapped 300 different people to give advice to its companies, Sturdy said. This deal marks its first investment in a public company.Care.com said it used a portion of the Google Capital investment to repurchase 3.7 million shares of its common stock from Matrix Partners at a price of $8.25 per share, a 5 percent discount to the 30-day volume-weighted average price. It also issued a new series of convertible preferred stock to Google Capital at an initial conversion price of $10.50 per share. Dividends on the stock will accrue at 5.5 percent annually, the company said. Matrix had been an investor since 2006 and wanted to make some divestments, so it was a good time to do a buyback, said Sheila Marcelo, Care.com chairwoman and chief executive officer. “It helps us reduce pressure on our stock,” she said.It’s official: Kleiner just pulled off a $1.4 billion fundraise: So much for losing its mojo. Despite twists and turns in recent years that have sometimes rivaled those of a telenovela, and even with its most famous member, John Doerr, no longer a general partner, Kleiner Perkins has raised two new funds totaling $1.4 billion, show newly processed SEC filings. The firm’s digital growth fund — its third — has secured $1 billion in commitments. The capital will be managed by Mary Meeker, Ted Schlein, Mood Rowghani and Noah Knauf, who very recently joined Kleiner from Warburg Pincus. Kleiner’s newest (17th!) early-stage fund, meanwhile, has closed with $400 million in commitments. As you’ve read here recently, Kleiner’s early-stage team now features five general partners: Schlein, Mike Abbott, Eric Feng, Beth Seidenberg and Wen Hsieh.Lyft Tells Investors to Expect No Growth in Rides for June: Lyft Inc. may be hitting a wall in its war with its richer competitor. Lyft told investors in a recent memo obtained by Bloomberg that it expects the number of rides it handles to be flat or down in June, compared with May. That follows a record month for rides in May. Lyft expects to beat its target for second-quarter ride volume by 35 percent, Lyft told its investors. \"This implies June will be flat to slightly down from the record May level given we face traditional seasonality headwinds in June as most college students leave their campuses for the summer,\" the note said. \"Additionally, June represents the first full month without Austin, after pausing operations in the city in May.\" (Uber and Lyft pulled out of Austin, Texas, after the city passed legislation that would require them to conduct fingerprinted background checks on their drivers.)  One Lyft investor told Bloomberg that, given the company’s heavy losses, if Lyft could sell itself for $5.5 billion -- the value of the company at its latest valuation -- that would be an acceptable price. Qatalyst could also help the startup sell a stake, rather than the whole business. The company also said in the memo that it reached a nearly $1.9 billion annual revenue run rate based on its performance in May. In November, it touted a $1 billion run rate. Revenue run rates apply monthly figures to a 12-month period. Investors use them to gauge the potential for growing businesses.While Lyft expects to lose hundreds of millions this year, Uber has lost money on a much larger scale. In three quarters last year Uber lost $1.7 billion. The company has committed to spending billions in China and India, and Uber has continued to subsidize rides against its global competitors like Didi Chuxing and Ola. Like Lyft, as a private company, Uber’s financials are private.Airbnb’s new funding round makes it the second-most valuable startup in the United States: Last year, Airbnb raised $1.5 billion at a $25.5 billion valuation. Earlier this month, the companyraised $1 billion in debt financing. And now, sources close to the company tell Recode, Airbnb is currently raising an undisclosed amount of cash at a $30 billion valuation. Such a deal would make Airbnb the second-most valuable startup in the United States, trailing only the $62.5 billion Uber. The New York Times first reporteddetails of Airbnb’s latest round. With all the new money, Airbnb plans to grow its global operation. Bloomberg has previously reported that the company plans to add booking features later this year for things beyond short-term home rentals (think museums, restaurants, etc.). In the meantime, Airbnb is being kept busy on the legal front. Earlier this week the company filed suit against the city of San Francisco for imposing stiff penalties on home rental registration rules that Airbnb helped write. The company is also locked in a battle with the New York government, where state legislatorsrecently passed a bill that would further restrict the company’s listings.Lyft Is Said to Hire Qatalyst as Uber’s Rival Explores Deals: Lyft Inc., the second-largest U.S. ride-hailing startup, is working with Qatalyst Partners LP to explore deal options, said a person familiar with the matter. Qatalyst, an investment bank founded by Wall Street veteran Frank Quattrone, has orchestrated high-profile sales of technology companies. Lyft and Qatalyst declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the hiring, said Quattrone has contacted large automakers about buying a stake in Lyft. In January, Lyft said General Motors invested $500 million into the San Francisco company. Lyft, which was last valued at $5.5 billion, has been overshadowed by Uber. While Lyft only operates in the U.S., it has teamed up with China’s Didi Chuxing and other global ride-hailing companies to form an alliance to take on Uber.China Tightens Internet Rules for Baidu and Other Search Engines: Chinese authorities will require Baidu Inc. and other search engines to report banned content and verify advertisers’ qualifications in its latest attempt at Internet regulation. Under rules to take effect Aug. 1, search engines operating in the country will be prohibited from providing banned information in various formats including links, summaries, cached pages, associative words, related searches and relevant recommendations, the Cyberspace Administration of China said in a statement. They will also be required to report websites and applications that contain prohibited content when spotted, the regulator said. Baidu, China’s biggest search engine, has been criticized recently for misleading users with search results. The Cyberspace Administration launched aninvestigation earlier this year after the death of Wei Zexi, a 21-year-old computer science major, who sought out a controversial treatment advertised among search results. Baidu said it would restrict the number of sponsored posts to 30 percent of a results page and establish a 1 billion yuan ($151 million) fund to fight fraud after the death of the student.Line, the biggest tech IPO of the year, struggles to show its growth plan can work: In delaying its IPO by two years, Japanese messaging app company Line Corp bought time to correct weak financial reporting controls, work on its business plan, bolster staffing - and left billions of dollars on the table as its valuation shriveled. Line's initial public offering in the next three weeks is set to raise about $1 billion, which given a global drought of such deals could make it the biggest tech listing this year, but skeptical fund managers point to tepid growth in Line's home market and doubts about its prospects for regional expansion. They also question whether its advertising revenue strategy will work. Fund managers who have watched Line's growth slow in a crowded global messaging app market assess the plan with caution. \"I'm not interested,\" said Yasuo Sakuma, portfolio manager at Bayview Asset Management, which manages 270 billion yen ($2.64 billion). \"Its growth outlook is very poor.\" \"Among the four countries that it's focusing on, only Indonesia has big room for growth in use,\" he added. \"Even there, the business outlook is not that easy.\" Growth in Line's monthly active users has tailed off after tripling across the world over the past three years. Last year, user numbers rose just 13 million to 218 million at the end of March, the IPO filing showed. The company isn't providing much visibility about the future either - it says in its filing that limited operating history makes it \"difficult\" to forecast future results. \"I went to the company's meeting with investors... but nothing moved me,\" said a fund manager at a major Japanese asset management firm who declined to be named because of company rules against discussing individual shares. \"It's not clear how it can make money out of its advertisement business.\" Line's likely valuation is far less than the $10 billion-$20 billion that was expected by investors when South Korean parent Naver Corp previously talked of a Line listing in 2013-2014, although Line may not have had much choice but to wait.InMobi, fined $1m for tracking users, had fine reduced based on 'company's financial condition': Mobile advertising network InMobi has been fined $950,000 by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for tracking the locations of millions of consumers, including children, without their knowledge or consent. InMobi was subject to a $4-million civil penalty, but it was reduced to $950,000 based on the company's financial condition. In addition, the company will be required to delete all information it collected from children, and will be prohibited from further violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).Uber switches out surge for price transparency: No more pop-ups asking you to agree to those murky “2.1x” (or some other “x” amount) surge fares on the Uber app. Soon Uber will just tell you the price of your ride up front. Uber pricing will still fluctuate with demand, but now you’ll know the dollar amount you’ll be paying for the ride, instead; “no math and no surprises,” says Uber. The new costs are calculated similarly to the old “x” surge pricing so you might still end up paying a ridiculous sum in certain places or times of day where demand for a ride home is going to be high. The price is based on expected time, distance, traffic, the number of riders requesting rides at that time and the number of drivers available nearby, but at least now you’ll know exactly how much of a punch the ride will make to your bank account. Uber will also allow either the driver or rider to update the app if you change your destination in the middle of the ride and says you’ll get a notification in the app with the change in price. The rideshare company also told me you won’t have to worry if your Uber driver goes way off the map and tries to charge you more or if the route is suddenly busy and they need to change course. The price you agreed on will still be the price you pay. So no more lightning bolts and pop-up screens asking you to agree to “3x” surge or whatever it is after you stumble out of the bar or head all the way across town. Just like with hotels and airfare, the prices change all the time, but you’ll know what the price is before you book. According to Uber, “hundreds of thousands of riders” have already received the pricing transparency rollout — including those in Miami, San Diego, Seattle, New Jersey, New York and some of the bigger cities in India like Mumbai and Hyderabad. Uber plans to roll out the changes to pricing in the app globally in the next few months.Clash of Clans May Spur Tencent’s Marvel-Like Aspirations: Tencent is spending $8.6 billion to gain control of Supercell Oy -- the Finnish maker of mobile games including Hay Day, Clash Royale and Boom Beach -- from SoftBank Group Corp. To see how that portfolio may fit into Tencent’s emerging entertainment empire, look at how the Chinese company leveraged World of Warcraft and League of Legends into global powerhouses.League of Legend’s 67 million monthly users helped Tencent earn $9 billion in game revenue last year, and the Tencent-backed movie “Warcraft” is setting box-office records in China since this month’s release. Acquiring Supercell reinforces Tencent’s entertainment aspirations against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc., and comes after Tencent bought the rights to 300-plus Japanese anime franchises in a push to become a worldwide multimedia brand like Marvel, DC and Disney. “Tencent has taken on a strategy to convert good IPs into movies and anime,” said Mark Tanner, founder of China Skinny, a Shanghai-based research and marketing agency. “It’s creating a world of superhero characters for entertainment.” Supercell occupied the top spot on researcher App Annie’s rankings of publishers fortwo years running. Clash of Clans was named an “essential” app by Apple Inc. and was promoted during the 2015 Super Bowl in a commercial featuring Academy Award-nominee Liam Neeson. Yet the game hasn’t been among the 10 top-grossing apps in China and Japan’s iOS Store since 2015, which is where Tencent’s clout can help.The company’s QQ and WeChat instant messaging apps have more than a billion users combined, and it could use those apps to promote Supercell games, Tanner said. That distribution system helped Tencent’s mobile-game revenue increase 16 percent to 8.2 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) in the quarter ending March 31, compared with the previous three months. China’s mobile gaming market expected to reach 68.8 billion yuan by 2018. “We do see there’s an opportunity for IPs of games and movies and video to cross and splice with each other, in the right way,” Martin Lau, Tencent’s president, said during a conference call Tuesday.Okta hires Goldman Sachs to lead IPO or sale: Okta Inc, a U.S. cloud identity management company valued at $1.2 billion in its latest private fundraising round, has hired Goldman Sachs Group to lead an initial public offering or outright sale, people familiar with the matter said. Okta's exploration of both an IPO and a sale underscores the dilemma faced by several technology companies this year, as frothy stock market valuations of many of their peers begin to come down, prompting potential buyers to enter the fray. Okta could file for an IPO as early as the second half of this year, the people said this week. However, the San Francisco-based company has also held talks with technology peers about being acquired, and could pursue a sale if it believes it can fetch a significantly higher valuation than in an IPO, the people added.Okta helps companies organize passwords and authenticate the identity of employees who log into work applications made by other software firms. Its customers include satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp and hospitality company MGM Resorts International. Okta has raised a total of roughly $230 million to date with investors such as Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and Khosla Ventures, Janus Capital Group and Altimeter Capital.Twilio prices its IPO at $15 per share, above its previous target: Twilio today said it would price its initial public offering at $15 per share, which would value the company at around $1.23 billion. That would value Twilio above its previous $1 billion valuation from its last financing round. With the pricing, the company expects to raise around $150 million, with an option for another 1.5 million shares to be purchased. It’s also a higher price than the $12-$14 per share price that the company previously targeted. Twilio’s IPO will be an important one given the drought of tech IPOs this year. Anxiety has gripped many startups that have hit unicorn status given the complete lack of tech IPOs for 2016 (Twilio will only be the third of the year). The hope, for many startups, is that Twilio will re-open the tech IPO window with a strong showing after trading begins tomorrow. If that happens, it might convince investors that many startups that have hit frothy valuations have come back in line with reality, and these companies could be good investment targets if they choose to go public. Twilio is not profitable, with the company reporting a net loss of $35.5 million on $166.9 million in revenue last year. But it’s showing strong revenue growth, with the company bringing in $88.8 million in revenue from 2014. In total, Twilio has raised more than $200 million in venture financing, with Bessemer Venture Partners owning the largest chunk of the company at 28.5 percent per its last IPO filing. Twilio is expected to start trading tomorrow, and we’ll see whether or not the appetite for tech IPOs will be coming back with its performance.Tesla offers $2.8 billion for SolarCity in 'no brainer' deal for Musk: Tesla’s stock drove off a cliff after the SolarCity bid was announced, and Elon Musk and his family could stand to gain $700 million in Tesla shares from SolarCity deal: Elon Musk on Tuesday sought to build a clean energy powerhouse as his electric car maker, Tesla Motors , made an offer to buy his solar installation firm SolarCity Corp in a stock deal worth as much as $2.8 billion. Tesla shares plunged more than 13 percent to $189.99 in extended trading - amounting to a loss in value of about $4.3 billion, or more than the value of the offer for the other company. Shares of SolarCity rose about 18 percent to $25.02. Musk, who is the chairman of SolarCity, CEO of Tesla and the largest shareholder of both companies, described the deal as a \"no brainer\" in a call with reporters. Tesla investors punished the company's shares, however.  Musk, who owns 19 percent of Tesla and 22 percent of SolarCity, said he would recuse himself from voting on the deal. He could not say how soon shareholders could vote on the deal, as due diligence needs to take place first. SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive, Musk's first cousin, said he supported the deal but would also recuse himself from voting. Rive's brother, Peter, is also a founder of the company and its chief technology officer.SoftBank President Nikesh Arora Plans to Step Down: A former Google executive and Silicon Valley star was on course to be the next chief executive of SoftBank of Japan, one of the world’s most prominent technology conglomerates. Now he is leaving, in an abrupt shakeout that shows cracks in SoftBank’s global ambitions. When the executive, Nikesh Arora, was poached two years ago from a coveted role as Google’s head of business operations, the hire was widely considered a coup for SoftBank. Its billionaire founder and chief executive, Masayoshi Son, crowned Mr. Arora heir apparent. Mr. Arora was vaunted for his deal-making prowess and seen as an international executive who would help transform SoftBank with a flurry of investments. One of Mr. Son’s most cherished ambitions was to turn SoftBank, a Japanese business with some notable overseas names like the American carrier Sprint, into a truly global enterprise. The honeymoon did not last.Investors have criticized Mr. Arora recently for his record of managing SoftBank’s overseas deals. Investments in start-ups like DramaFever and Housing.com, these shareholders have said, appear to have soured as the companies have faltered. And the carefully orchestrated succession plan — or what appeared to be — has collapsed. Mr. Son decided he was not ready to give up the reins soon. Mr. Son, 58, said in a statement that he still wanted to “work on a few more crazy ideas” at SoftBank. Mr. Son cited differences over when Mr. Arora would take over as chief executive as the reason he had agreed to step down. Mr. Arora, who was born in India, holds the titles of president and chief operating officer. “This will require me to be C.E.O. for at least another five to 10 years — this is not a time frame for me to keep Nikesh waiting for the top job,” Mr. Son said. Mr. Arora, 48, also presented the parting as amicable. “Masa and I are still in love with each other,” he posted on Twitter. “I will support everyone I invested in, and they know that.”VR is the future of porn, and it’s a creepy future indeed: This got real weird, real fast. And not just because I was demoing the technology in the middle of the E3 floor, surrounded by fellow show-goers. It’s just — well, even after all the explainers in the world, it’s hard to sufficiently brace your mind for all that virtual reality porn entails. It occupied a small space, tucked in the rear of the LA Convention Center, but Naughty America may just have had the one booth capable of rivaling Nintendo’s for sheer show buzz. We must have walked by the thing a dozen times during our three days on the floor, and there was always a small army of show-goers lined up to take it for a spin. Much like, say, your standard first-person shooter, the technology is built around a POV (point-of-view) shot, putting the viewer in the place of the camera. The effect is already a bit jolting (and, at times nausea-inducing) in standard VR, but all of that really goes next level when you look down and you’ve swapped your bits and bobs with someone else’s. The company’s demo cycles through a few short clips, in which the scenery, scenarios and co-stars change, but, well, the view pretty much stays the same. It’s hard to say how much of the initial shock is due to the newness of the technology and how much is firmly entrenched in the uncanny valley, though the company told me that many attendees enjoyed the demo, strange setting and all.Once you get past the somewhat off-putting nature of swapping nether regions with a professional, VR porn does offer an interesting way forward for an industry that, like many others, has been hard hit by the prevalence of free online content.Apple May Soon Open Retail Stores in India: After months of delays, Apple is likely to open its first retail stores in India, a fast-growing market for smartphones where the American technology giant has little presence. New rules issued by the Indian government on Monday exempt foreign-owned companies that want to open stores selling a single brand of products from requirements that 30 percent of the content of those products come from India. The exemption, which lasts three years, can be extended to eight years in the case of companies selling “cutting edge” items, such as Apple’s iPhones and Macs. Apple, which makes virtually all of its devices in China, lobbied for months for the loosening, and Timothy D. Cook, the company’s chief executive, discussed it with government officials during his first visit to India last month.An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the issue on Monday. The company has not yet received any formal response from the Indian government on its application to open stores. By themselves, new stores will have little impact on Apple’s small market share in India, beyond serving as a marketing tool. Although Indians will buy an estimated 139 million smartphones this year, Android models that cost less than $120 dominate the market, according to the Gartner research firm.Apple says its sales in India grew 56 percent during its last fiscal quarter, but its cheapest phones typically run $400 or more. Its total annual sales in India were around two million units last year, according to Gartner.Chinese Curb Cyberattacks on U.S. Interests, Report Finds: Nine months after President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to a broad crackdown on cyberespionage aimed at curbing the theft of intellectual property, the first detailed study of Chinese hacking has found a sharp drop-off in almost daily raids on Silicon Valley firms, military contractors and other commercial targets. But the study, conducted by the iSight intelligence unit of FireEye, a company that manages large network breaches, also concluded that the drop-off began a year before Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi announced their accord in the White House Rose Garden. In a conclusion that is largely echoed by American intelligence officials, the study said the change is part of Mr. Xi’s broad effort to bring the Chinese military, which is considered one of the main sponsors of the attacks, further under his control. As a result, the same political forces that may be alleviating the theft of data from American companies are also responsible for Mr. Xi’s stunningly swift crackdown on the Chinese media, bloggers and others who could challenge the Communist Party.Wal-Mart to Buy 5% Stake in JD.com as Part of Chinese Deal: Wal-Mart Stores will acquire a 5 percent stake in Asian e-commerce giant JD.com Inc. in a deal that will reshape the U.S. retail chain’s operations in China. As part of the agreement, JD.com will take ownership of Wal-Mart’s Yihaodian online marketplace, the companies said in a statement Monday. The Chinese branch of Sam’s Club also will open a store on JD.com, and the two companies will link up their supply chains. The partnership gives Wal-Mart a fresh start in China after it struggled to adapt to a slowing local economy and a rise in online shopping. Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon has said that the company needs to succeed in China, where it estimates that 25 percent of global retail growth will come from in the next five years.A 5 percent stake in JD.com would be worth about $1.5 billion at its current stock price. Wal-Mart will receive about 145 million newly issued Class A shares of JD.com in the transaction. That deal will increase the retailer’s earnings per share by 16 to 19 cents in the second quarter, according to the statement.Apple to lose weighting in Russell index, shares could fall: After dropping more than $200 billion in market capitalization in one year, Apple shares could fall further as they are set to lose their weighting and be reclassified in the annual reconstitution of the widely followed Russell indexes. When all is said and done, about $1.3 billion more will be sold in Apple Inc shares at the market close on Friday, when the reconstitution of the Russell indexes takes effect, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse. Because Apple has been aggressively buying back and retiring its stock, outstanding shares have dropped to less than 5.5 billion from 5.8 billion in late June 2015, when the Russell indexes were last recalibrated, according to Reuters data. Apple's weighting in the Russell 1000 will roughly fall to 2.52 percent from 2.77 percent, Credit Suisse said. The decline is due to the combination of fewer shares outstanding and Apple's smaller part of the index's capitalization. The performance of a market-weighted index is more influenced by larger companies, like Apple. Adding to the selling pressure, Apple will be classified as both a value and a growth company at Russell. After the close on Friday, 92 percent of Apple will be considered \"growth\" and 8 percent \"value\" according to index provider FTSE Russell, splitting it between two Russell subindexes. The move matters because value managers that peg their investments to the Russell indexes will be buying Apple while growth managers will be selling. Because there are more assets benchmarked to growth than to value, there will be net selling of Apple, said Meera Krishnan, U.S. index strategist at Credit Suisse in New York. She estimated there will be over $850 million of selling in Apple out of the growth component of the Russell 1000 and about $400 million of buying from the value side.Phone Tracking, Nude Selfie IOUs See Chinese Bare All for Credit: Talkative people pay back loans. The very talkative default. Too taciturn is no good either. Also, don’t take out a loan at 4 a.m. Those are lessons from online lenders in China that are tracking people’s behavior -- via apps on their mobile phones -- and taking it into account when deciding what their credit ratings should be. Chinese consumers don’t mind handing over personal details that would spark outrage in the West, in exchange for lower interest rates. WeLab Ltd., a Hong Kong-based online lender that makes loans in China, looks at what apps people have downloaded, where they go using the phone’s GPS tracker, their social networks and their school records. It offers discounted interest rates for each extra piece of personal information that helps profile customers for credit ratings. In Hong Kong, for example, giving WeLab access to a Facebook account gets a 5 percent discount on the cost of a loan, and access to LinkedIn gets you 10 percent off, on loans with interest rates that otherwise reach as high as 20 percent. \"Chinese people have no issue handing over their personal data, giving you their credit card number, giving you their bank account,\" said GGV Capital’s Shanghai-based managing partner Jenny Lee, whose Silicon Valley venture capital firm has invested in data-hungry tech giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. \"Look at the whole internet finance sector, people are giving you their bank statement so you can do profiling.\" Some are perhaps over-sharing. University students desperate for cash have been sending nude photos of themselves as collateral to several online lending platforms, according to the official People’s Daily. Typically they get loans of 15,000 yuan ($2,280) -- more if they’re doctoral students or enrolled at a famous university, the report said, and at least one loan had a weekly interest rate of 30 percent. Delinquent borrowers face the threat of their naked selfies being sent to family if they don’t pay.Apple says iPhones still available for sale in China: Apple  said its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were still available for sale in China after Beijing's intellectual property regulators barred their sales saying the designs had infringed a patent held by a Chinese company. \"We appealed an administrative order from a regional patent tribunal in Beijing last month and as a result the order has been stayed pending review by the Beijing IP Court,\" Apple said in a statement on Friday. The notice, dated May 19, banning sales of certain iPhone models in Beijing was posted on a Chinese government website. The Chinese market is vital to Apple, driving more of its sales than any other region outside the United States. But the tech giant has faced greater scrutiny there in recent months, with its online book and film services blocked by Chinese regulators earlier this year. Apple historically had enjoyed favorable treatment in China, but Beijing’s crackdown on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus is a reminder that the tech giant is not immune to the scrutiny that other U.S. tech firms have long faced in the country, said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners.Uber Rival’s $28 Billion Valuation Shows Size of China’s Ride-Sharing Market: The Chinese car-hailing app Didi Chuxing said on Thursday that it had brought in $7.3 billion in its latest round of fund-raising, which included Apple, Alibaba, and SoftBank as investors. The new funds give the company a total of $10.5 billion in disposable funds, and put its valuation at $28 billion, according to a person familiar with the fund-raising. That Didi’s valuation is now almost half that of the $62.5 billion valuation of its main rival in China, Uber, shows how much potential investors see in China. Yet the size of the cash infusions also underscores the market’s difficulties. In part because of China’s widespread blocking of foreign websites, the competition between Uber and Didi marks the first time in recent history a major foreign tech company has vied so intensely with a local Chinese business. In other markets the contest over ride-sharing has focused on regulation and technology, but in China it has been much more about cash, with the two companies spending billions. The most recent round has also pulled in Apple, pitting America’s biggest tech company against America’s best-known start-up, Uber, in a tricky Chinese market. Both see China as critical to growth. The fund-raising comes as executives from Didi and Uber have signaled that they are focusing on profitability in China. Since then both companies have been locked in a spending war. Though it has primarily taken the form of subsidies, both companies have also tried to develop technology specific to China, and have actively wooed both local and national government officials. Didi has focused on technology that better predicts car arrival times, given China’s unruly traffic, while Uber has developed a commute function that links drivers with riders based on where they live and work.Why back-up cameras haven’t stopped drivers from backing into stuff: With or without eyes in the back of their heads, drivers keep hitting things. Despite the growing prevalence of back-up cameras, federal data shows that this technology hasn't significantly cut down on cars backing into people and causing them harm. That research on so-called \"back-over incidents\" comes as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration moves to make back-up cameras standard and presses automakers to add a bevy of new technologies -- from automatic braking to lane collision warnings -- to even entry-level cars to reduce accidents on the road.As car companies and even regulators increasingly lean on technology to make roads safer, the tepid success of the back-up camera is a red flag. Sure, drivers can see more of what's behind them -- the cameras reduce blind zones while in reverse by 90 percent, according to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety -- but they keep hitting things.Even with back-up cameras, drivers still don’t look around their vehicles enough when in reverse and sometimes get distracted by any number of things as their cars roll backward. Back-up cameras also often beam images to display screens in the front of the car, and drivers can become too reliant on them. Instead of looking backward and through their rearview window or checking mirrors, their eyes are glued to a screen.LG Electronics sells mosquito-repelling TV in India: The Indian arm of South Korea's LG Electronics Inc has begun selling a TV with a feature that it says repels mosquitoes, which can spread diseases such as malaria, Zika and dengue. The TV's \"Mosquito Away Technology\" uses ultrasonic waves that are inaudible to humans but cause mosquitoes to fly away, according to the company. It was released in the country on Thursday, LG said. The same technology, which was certified as effective by an independent laboratory near Chennai, India, has been used by LG in air conditioners and washing machines, the company said. The technology, which also functions when the TV is switched off, is available in two models, priced at 26,500 rupees and 47,500 rupees ($394 and $706). The TV is targeted at lower-income consumers living in conditions that would make them vulnerable to mosquitoes. It will go on sale next month in the Philippines and Sri Lanka. Kim Sang-yeol, an LG Electronics official, said there are no plans for now to market it elsewhere.Salesforce also made a bid for LinkedIn, CEO Benioff confirms: Salesforce was also a serious bidder for LinkedIn, the business networking site that sold to Microsoft for $26 billion this week, said CEO Marc Benioff. While he would not give details of the effort, sources said Salesforce was primarily interested in LinkedIn's recruiting business, which makes up the bulk of its revenue. Sources said LinkedIn was already deep into negotiations with Microsoft when Salesforce made its approach, which would have required both debt and stock financing. Microsoft was able to buy LinkedIn in cash and also promised to let it operate independently. Interestingly, sources confirmed numerous reports that Microsoft had tried to buy Salesforce earlier this year, and both price and the way it would be operated within the company were among the issues that resulted in it not happening. Indeed. Salesforce recently bought Demandware for $2.8 billion.Good VR is great — and bad VR is abysmal: VR is a powerful medium, but difficult to work with — because the developer is put in the position of creating a sense of self and presence, more is required of them, and while successes are almost impossible to describe properly, failures are conspicuous and easily dissected. It’s easiest to illustrate with actual examples. Easily the most interesting VR experience I’ve had at E3 (of a dozen or so) was an Oculus demo called “The Climb,” by a team at Crytek. Using the Touch controllers (a new innovation; previously a gamepad was used), you manipulate a pair of disembodied hands, gripping ridges and cracks to make your way up a cliff face. Like many VR games, it sounds rather… boring. In fact, it’s genius, but only within VR — and like so many other games, the only way to find that out is to play it. Nevertheless, It’s excellent for several reasons, and these act as sort of guidelines for content that fits VR’s strengths and avoid its weaknesses. Alas, I was disappointed by “Final Fantasy XV: The VR Experience,” despite being hyped for the game itself. Here, I found, was the worst possible outcome: a game that should and could be interesting, but does almost nothing right. Unlike “The Climb,” it sounds like a blast on paper. You and the other main characters from the game are in a battle with a Behemoth, one of the game’s most well-known monsters. You’re Prompto, the one who has a gun, supporting your buddies as they fight hand to hand. What it amounts to, however, and I’m heartily sorry to say it, is a disjointed and boring five minutes that may leave you less excited for the game than when you donned the headset.What are leveraged loans and why does Uber want one? Uber, fresh off $3.5 billion from the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, is in talks to closeanother $1-2 billion in the form of leveraged loans. Over the last 24 hours, the term “leveraged loans” has been thrown around a lot, but few in the startup world have seen this term before.The Wall Street Journal reported that the company would like to settle on a 4-4.5 percent interest rate. This appears ambitious but let’s assume that it is accurate. While not completely applicable, Apple issued $12 billion in bonds at a 3.22 percent blended interest rate excluding floating rate debt. Yes, 4.5 percent is greater than 3.22 percent but junk bond references by the Wall Street Journal and Recode should be taken lightly. Junk bonds can generate upwards of 7 percent interest. Plenty of well-known publicly traded companies have issued bonds at rates higher than 4.5 percent and survived to fight another day. Yes, both leveraged loans and junk bonds have higher-than-normal interest rates. Unlike junk bonds, a 4-4.5 percent interest rate for Uber shouldn’t invoke images of the subprime mortgage crisis.SpaceX’s latest rocket landing ended in a ‘rapid unscheduled disassembly’: Elon Musk's SpaceX failed to complete what would have been its fifth landing of a reusable booster rocket Wednesday, a down note on what appeared to be an otherwise successful mission to deliver two Boeing-built communication satellites to high orbit above the Earth. \"Falcon 9 was lost in this attempt,\" the company said in its webcast. As the satellites headed on their way Wednesday, the booster rocket began its descent toward the ocean for a landing on a special floating platform. Video footage of the attempt seemed to show the booster touching down, then flames, before the picture froze.As with previous attempts, SpaceX had said landing the reusable booster rocket would be made more difficult by the fact that it would be falling from higher up. And, the company said, the rocket would have less fuel than normal to control its descent. SpaceX founder Elon Musk later tweeted that it appeared the the thrust in one of three landing engines was insufficient, causing the rocket to come in far too fast. In what he said may have been SpaceX's \"hardest impact\" ever, the booster ultimately suffered an RUD, or \"rapid unscheduled disassembly.\" Upgrades to compensate for the problem could come by year's end, said Musk.Uber Sets Sights on Leveraged Loans for Even More Money: Uber has raised more than $14 billion using all sorts of creative funding sources. Now it may add something new to the list: the leveraged loan market. The ride-hailing start-up is looking to issue as much as $2 billion in securities to investors, said a person briefed on the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are managing the process, said the person, adding that the deal has not begun yet and may still fall apart.By tapping leveraged loans, Uber is adding to its trove of billions made up of many types of securities, which the company has been spending as it expands worldwide. Uber has raised equity from traditional venture capital sources, strategic corporate investors and private equity. This month, the company said that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. Uber has also raised billions in convertible debt, which can be exchanged for equity at a future date. Uber has redefined private fund-raising, drawing hundreds of millions in new cash or debt at a rapid pace of once every few months. The company needs financing as it now operates in at least 69 countries and is fighting an expensive battle in China against a rival, Didi Chuxing, which is also raising money to expand. Leveraged loans are rarely used among start-ups. A leveraged loan is a security issued to a company that has a lot of debt on its books already, and thus is perceived by investors as being a higher risk. The loans are typically used for leveraged buyouts and are seldom seen in Silicon Valley. Uber has been able to tap less traditional funding sources because investors think its size and scale make it a safer bet than other Silicon Valley companies. Uber’s valuation of $62.5 billion — making it the highest valued venture-backed start-up in the world — would not change with this new investment. Leveraged loans also allow Uber to raise money without diluting the holdings of its many equity investors — some of which have been through more than a dozen rounds of financing.Alibaba Tries to Shore Up Investors’ Confidence: The Alibaba Group of China has disappointed investors since its record-breaking American stock listing nearly two years ago, as volatile financial results and regulatory run-ins have driven the price of its shares down almost to where they began. Now the e-commerce giant is trying to reassure. For the first time, Alibaba on Tuesday offered investors financial guidance for the coming year, saying that it expected revenue growth to accelerate from last year’s pace. At a meeting at its Hangzhou headquarters, Alibaba cited strength in its core business, despite China’s slowing economic growth, as well as benefits from new ventures that have raised eyebrows among some investors The forecast comes as Alibaba seeks to demonstrate that its strategy, which has long focused on growth, is good for business. In China, Alibaba operates online sales platforms that connect consumers with mom-and-pop stores, as well as with global brands like Burberry and Zara. It has been showing sales growth on its platforms using a measure called gross merchandise volume, a yardstick for transactions across its platforms. Alibaba said on Tuesday that it would de-emphasize that figure, saying it would no longer report it quarterly. It will continue to report an annual figure, and offered a target for 2020.India's Space Program Takes On Elon Musk: India’s space agency will launch a record 22 satellites on a single rocket as it tries to ease a global backlog and demonstrate the ability to compete with commercial spaceflight companies run by billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.Satellites from the U.S., India, Canada and Germany will enter orbit after a scheduled June 20 liftoff from the Sriharikota barrier island along the southeast coast, the agency’s chairman, A.S. Kiran Kumar, said in an interview in Bengaluru.The 22 machines being launched next week include an Earth observation satellite to capture light invisible to the naked eye. It is the biggest single launch by India, trailing Russia’s 33 in 2014 and NASA’s 29 the year before. India last month successfully launched a scale model of a reusable spacecraft, a project that in time could pit the nation against Bezos and Musk in the race to make access to space cheaper and easier. The country also injected a probe into Mars’ atmosphere in 2014 for just $74 million, about 11 percent of the cost of the U.S.’s Maven probe.Microsoft, Reasserting Its Muscle, Buys LinkedIn for $26.2 Billion:  Microsoft has made its most ambitious move in years to reassert itself in a technology market it once dominated. The software giant said Monday morning that it would acquire LinkedIn in a $26.2 billion cash deal. The acquisition, by far the largest in Microsoft’s history, unites two companies in different businesses: one a big maker of software tools, the other the largest business-oriented social networking site, with more than 400 million members globally. The deal is Microsoft’s biggest bet yet that the traditional software business is shifting quickly to cloud computing, a model in which customers rent software and other services delivered over the internet. While LinkedIn does not have the household name of Facebook, a much larger and more lucrative social network, it is the most widely used site for people to advertise their professional skills and work history.Though they operate in different businesses, Microsoft and LinkedIn make most of their money by catering to professionals. Executives involved in the deal said that the common thread prompted the acquisition. “They know the interconnections of the business world,” said Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, a technology research firm. “That could really benefit Microsoft from a sales standpoint.”What happens when your search engine is first to know you have cancer:This week researchers demonstrated that by analyzing a person’s Web searches they could in some cases predict an upcoming diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The team of researchers aren’t pancreatic cancers experts, but computer scientists at Microsoft. Unlike traditional medical professionals, they have the advantage of access to a trove of data that Microsoft collects through its search engine, Bing. The Microsoft researchers identified Web users who had recently searched for queries indicating they have pancreatic cancer, such as “I was told I have pancreatic cancer, what to expect,” and then looked back months earlier to examine patterns in the symptoms that the users searched for. This included phrases such as “dark or tarry stool,” “abdominal swelling,” “dark urine” and “yellowing skin.” From this analysis they realized trends in the queries of users who were soon to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, identifying 5 to 15 percent of cases with low false-positive rates. The research was published in the Journal of Oncology Practice.Alibaba Bears Pounce as SEC Probe, SoftBank Sale Squeeze Shares:Traders have never been more bearish on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the fast-growing Chinese e-commerce company facing a regulatory probe and the loss of a key investor. The total number of outstanding shares borrowed for short selling peaked at more than 124 million last week. That’s the most since its 2014 initial public offering and is up from about 60 million in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Markit. Prominent short sellers including Jim Chanos and John Hempton have been red-flagging Alibaba for months, suggesting that its growth figures might be too good to be true. Bearish bets spiked in the past two weeks after the company disclosed a regulatoryprobe of its Chinese delivery unit and SoftBank Group Corp. disclosed plans to sell a $10 billion stake. Alibaba, which claimed more than 75 percent of the e-commerce market share in China last year, made history with a record $25 billion initial public offering in September 2014. Traders in New York clamored for the stock, which was priced at $68 a share, as a way to tap into the potential profits available from the country’s growing middle class. The shares have dropped 6.4 percent to $75.92 since May 25 when the company said that the SEC is looking at data reported from the company’s Singles’ Day promotion, Alibaba’s biggest shopping day, and how the company consolidates results from affiliates, including logistics partner Cainiao Network. While SoftBank’s divestment comes as part of a broader strategy to find new investments in startups and strengthen its debt-heavy balance sheet, the move can be unsettling to investors as the Japanese technology giant first bought into the company 16 years ago, said Henry Guo, a New York-based analyst at M Science. “The stake sale by SoftBank caught the market off guard, which damped Alibaba shares as it’s one of the early investors,” Guo, who has been covering Chinese internet stocks traded in the U.S. for about 10 years and has a positive outlook on Alibaba, said by phone.Why Line’s Two-Year Wait for IPO Cost It $4 Billion in Valuation: Line Corp. has finally pulled the trigger on an initial public offering after a two-year hiatus. That period of hesitation may have cost the messaging service $4 billion in valuation as Facebook Inc. began encroaching on its turf and markets cooled on technology company debuts. Japan’s leading mobile messaging service is aiming to raise as much as 113 billion yen ($1 billion) in July at a market value of roughly 588 billion yen, according to data in its Friday IPO filings. That’s down 40 percent from an estimated 1 trillion yen when it first filed for an offering in 2014. The price range will be set on June 27, and the final price July 11. That may be as good as it gets. Line’s gearing up for a battle with far larger rivals like Facebook and China’s WeChat as it looks to expand its 218 million user base beyond its strongest markets of Japan, Taiwan and Thailand. The Tokyo-based company, owned by South Korean search portal Naver Corp., plans to use the proceeds to spearhead an expansion across Asia and, eventually, the U.S. “Line will have its market in Japan fairly fortified from the likes of WhatsApp or even Facebook Messenger,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. “Outside of its core markets, it’s going to be a massive challenge.”Thomas J. Perkins, Pioneering Venture Capitalist in Silicon Valley, Dies at 84: Thomas J. Perkins, who nurtured Silicon Valley’s venture capital industry into a force that later helped foster the growth of companies like Google and Amazon, died Tuesday night at his home in Marin County, Calif. He was 84. Mr. Perkins co-founded the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in 1972, at a time when parts of Silicon Valley were still fruit orchards. Mr. Perkins and his partners popularized a model of investment that involved putting small amounts of money into promising young start-ups in return for a stake in the companies, giving them advice and counsel to spur their growth. Some of the investments turned into gigantic hits. Mr. Perkins had said that his favorite investment was Genentech, a biotechnology company that has since been acquired by Roche. Over time, Kleiner Perkins — and its home on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif. — became a destination for other venture capitalists. Mr. Perkins helped recruit venture capitalists like John Doerr to his firm, leading to investments in a new generation of technology companies, including Netscape, AOL, Amazon and later Google. The firm’s success transformed Silicon Valley and the technology and biotechnology industries, leading to a proliferation of venture firms in the region and creating an ecosystem of investment in start-ups that today remains unrivaled in any other part of the world. Later in his life, Mr. Perkins was embroiled in several controversies. In 1996, he was convicted in France of involuntary manslaughter from a yacht collision. In another, he stepped down from the board of Hewlett-Packard in 2006 after he said the company had used illegal methods to obtain his phone records. The allegations led to the resignation of H.P.’s chairwoman and an overhaul of the board. He also publicly broke with Kleiner Perkins in 2014 after writing an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal in which he compared the “progressive war on the American 1 percent” to the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. The comments set off a firestorm, and the firm moved to distance itself from Mr. Perkins, who later apologized for his language. David A. Kaplan, who wrote a biography of Mr. Perkins titled “Mine’s Bigger: The Extraordinary Tale of the World’s Greatest Sailboat and the Silicon Valley Tycoon Who Built It” (2007), said in an interview on Thursday that Mr. Perkins’s “legacy won’t be helped by all the excessive things he said in recent years and the grudges he nursed,” though he was a “seminal figure” for Silicon Valley.Uber Feels UberPop Hangover With French, German Legal Setbacks: Uber Technologies Inc. is feeling the sting of European judges from Paris to Frankfurt over UberPop, suffering setbacks in France and Germany months after it took the ride-sharing option out of its app there. On Thursday, a French criminal court fined the company and two of its executives a total of 850,000 euros ($960,000), half of which was suspended, and a German appeals court separately said it wouldn’t overturn a ban of UberPop in the country. French prosecutors had attacked Uber for fraudulent commercial practices and encouraging illegal activity through UberPop, as well as improper use of personal data. “UberPop went on for months illegally, though the company and its executives knew very well what the applicable legal context was,” judge Cecile Louis-Loyant said in Paris. She fined Uber France 800,000 euros, the head of its French operations, Thibaud Simphal, 20,000 euros and Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, the company’s general manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, another 30,000 euros, saying they incited others to break the law by working for the service, leading to riots and taxistrikes in the French capital. UberPop, which allows anyone with a vehicle and driver’s license to offer a cab-like service, stopped in July in France and was banned in Germany in March 2015. Meanwhile Uber’s main chauffeured-car service, that requires registration with authorities, is still going.Why everyone should worry about this scary glitch that affected rich drivers: Carmaker Toyota and its luxury brand Lexus rushed to fix a software bug Wednesday that had caused a malfunction in vehicles’ GPS, climate control and “infotainment,” or front console radio systems. It disabled the backup camera and hands-free phone functions as well. Errant data broadcast Tuesday by the company’s traffic and weather service confounded vehicles' \"Enform\" infotainment system installed in 2014, 2015 and 2016 Lexus vehicles and the 2016 Toyota Land Cruiser, the company said. The data made the subscription-based “Enform” system continuously reboot itself, rendering it unusable and drawing the ire and  of many a driver. Lexus’s social media accounts were flooded with complaints through Wednesday morning and by 9 a.m., the company told customers to stand by for a momentary fix. Owners should force a reset of their vehicle’s computer by disconnecting its 12-volt battery for at least 5 minutes, the company said. Owners can also bring their vehicles to a Lexus dealer to reset their system. The company halted the offending data stream overnight, but did not anticipate lingering problems in its vehicles. Lexus said it is still determining how many vehicles the bug impacted. The same way smartphone or software companies remotely update their products, car companies are increasingly doing the same to fix operating system glitches and even update road maps and car-friendly mobile applications. That’s because cars are increasingly becoming giant rolling computers, capable of doing an untold number of tasks while getting from Point A to Point B. Consider the“Enform” service, which includes smartphone and app connectivity, SiriusXM satellite radio, traffic and weather updates and Bluetooth connectivity. A new car might have 100 million lines of code, according to a report by research and accounting firm Stout Risius Ross. The more luxurious the car, the more interconnected its technological components may be.What to Do With Apple Cash? Irish Dilemma as EU Ruling Looms: As Ireland braces itself for a possible European Union order to claw back Apple Inc.’s unpaid taxes, government officials warned Finance Minister Michael Noonan that he would face two crucial questions upon delivery of a ruling that could come “soon.” The first is whether to appeal at the EU’s top court. The second, is what to do with the “large recovery amounts” pending the outcome. Ireland could be sitting on the cash for “several years,” according to a briefing note from last month published Wednesday. Amid growing speculation that Apple could be forced to pay back billions of euros of tax breaks, officials said they are preparing for the worst and that an adverse ruling “could have significant negative implications for Ireland, in terms of reputation and the creation of uncertainty around our tax system.”Apple Pay competitor CurrentC is the disaster everyone thought it would be: Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. When Walmart and other big retailers said in 2012 that they were creating a consortium called MCX to build a payments app, a lot of people laughed. The idea of a bunch of retailers collaborating effectively on a joint venture seemed far-fetched, let alone one where technology would play a critical role. Then there was the motivation for the venture, which seemed shortsighted: Get customers to pay with anything but traditional credit cards, since they cost Walmart and other retailers higher transaction fees than other forms of payment. There were plenty of other signs along the way spelling out trouble. Just a sampling: Customers who signed up for the app had their email addresses leaked in a hack in 2014, and the new CEO who arrived in 2015 said the launch likely wouldn't happen until 2016. In the meantime, some big MCX partners like Best Buy said they would start accepting Apple Pay. Finally, Walmart — perhaps MCX's biggest initial backer — announced its own app, Walmart Pay. Some Walmart insiders were obviously tired of waiting for CurrentC to become a reality.Turns out there was good reason for these red flags. On Tuesday, the company notified beta users of its payments app, CurrentC, that the test was ending and their accounts were being deleted. This news followed MCX layoffs in May. It finally looks like game over for CurrentC.Sovereign wealth funds throw funding lifeline to tech ventures: A succession of funding deals by deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds have thrown a life preserver to some of the world’s biggest private tech firms whose high valuations have come under scrutiny in the past year. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States along with state-backed investors in Singapore and China have ploughed money into hot tech investments such as ride-sharing company Uber  and Chinese Internet giant Alibaba and its private affiliates. With overall funding for start-ups slowing down by a third to $25.5 billion in the last two quarters, according to data from CB Insights, high-profile ventures are turning to government funds or institutional money to create \"private IPOs\" rather than to venture capitalists or chancing public listings. These capital injections have helped to keep valuations high as other tech ventures such as those of cloud storage service Dropbox or Indian takeaway food ordering app Zomato have been marked down by some earlier backers. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund said last week it invested $3.5 billion in Uber, Silicon Valley's most highly valued private company. At $62.5 billion, the car-sharing firm is worth more than the stock market capitalizations of automakers BMW or GM and close to VW, Daimler and Ford. Also last week, Singapore's two big government investors bought $1 billion of Alibaba Group shares, while in April, China Investment Corp, took part in a $4.5 billion round in Alibaba's financial services affiliate ANT Financial with other investors, marking the largest ever funding round in a fintech firm. Saudi Arabia's $3.5 billion stake in Uber was the largest ever single private investment in a tech company while the Kuwait Investment Authority took the lead this year in a $165 million private equity funding for struggling U.S. wearable devices maker Jawbone, one of seven tech and healthcare ventures it has made in the last two years. Qatar Investment Authority invested in Uber and Indian ecommerce firm Flipkart in 2014. Norway’s $865-billion fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth investor, is a major backer of publicly traded tech stocks such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), but it can only invest in an unlisted company in the final run up to a public offering. Restrictions on private investments mean it passed on an offer from Facebook (FB.O) to invest several years ago.The unsexiest trillion-dollar startup: Steve Jobs went ballistic when public shipping manifests leaked the existence of the iPhone 3G. That’s about the only time something exciting happened in the freight forwarding business. The circulatory system of the global economy is a trillion-dollar industry, yet no one really talks about it, or builds tech for it. That’s what makes freight such a massive disruption opportunity for a startup likeFlexport.  Transparency begets data, which begets efficiency. Smarter shipping shrinks the physical world the way faster internet shrinks the digital one. New businesses emerge. High bandwidth connections paved the way for Netflix. Now Flexport could make meatspace merchants as nimble as Amazon. With $26.9 million in funding, Flexport grew the volume of goods it ships by 16X this year. Y Combinator president Paul Graham says “Flexport is one of that small handful of startups that are going to change the world.” Freight might finally be getting the weight of attention it deserves. Stick with me. Anything weighing over 150 kilos can’t be sent like a parcel through the postal service. It qualifies as freight, and can require several separately owned vehicles to deliver it across land, sea, or air from its source like a factory to a destination like a retail store. To get the best deal on each leg of the journey and handle the hand-offs through customs, freight forwarding services serve as an organizational logistics layer. They have direct relationships with carriers like truck owners and massive shipping container boats. But like I said, it’s an unsexy business, so until recently, freight forwarding was still being done with a jumble of Excel, email, fax, and paper manifests shipped around the world. That made it extremely tough to spot overspending or snags in supply chains. That is, until Flexport indexed all the available carriers into a searchable database in its free software for organizing and tracking shipments. In 2016 it’s moved freight to or from 64 countries for over 700 clients like Ring and Le Tote, with a $1.5 billion annual run-rate of merchandise value shipped. There’s 2.4 million toys and 412,000 pieces of glassware currently in transit on the Flexport platform. Its investors include First Round, Founders Fund, Felicis, GV (Google Ventures), Box Group, Bloomberg Beta, and Ashton Kutcher. That’s quite an ascent considering Petersen admits “I didn’t learn what the term ‘freight forwarder’ meant until a year into starting the business.”Uber Rolls Out App Improvements to Meet Driver Demands: Tensions have long simmered between Uber and its drivers who power the ride-hailing service. Drivers held protests when Uber cut fares with little warning and have filed class-action lawsuits to be recognized as company employees rather than independent contractors. Uber is now trying to improve the experience of its drivers. On Monday, the company announced a host of software improvements to its app to address driver demands. Among the changes, drivers can now more easily pause ride requests, making it easier for them to take bathroom breaks and fill their gas tanks. Drivers can now also be paid instantly for each ride they complete, rather than weekly, and see on the app’s dashboard how much they have earned.Among the many changes for drivers that Uber announced on Monday was a partnership with companies that can give tax advice to drivers. Uber said drivers could now also receive discounts on Uber rides, auto maintenance and cellphone data plans. In addition, Uber created a fuel finder function in the app that shows drivers the cheapest places nearby to fill up the gas tank, with the aim that Uber can someday negotiate with filling stations to provide discounts to Uber drivers. And the Uber app will automatically start a ride two minutes after arriving at a rider’s location so that drivers are paid if they have to wait for passengers. Tardy passengers are a frequent complaint on driver blogs.Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/BloombergLine Plans Year’s Biggest Tech IPO, Pitching U.S. Investors: \n",
      "Japan’s Line Corp. is headed for what could be the biggest initial public offering for a technology company this year, including a major pitch to American investors. The company behind one of Asia’s most popular messaging apps plans to go public in Tokyo and New York in mid-to-late July, with a goal of raising between $1 billion and $2 billion at a valuation of $5 billion to $6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The Tokyo-based company aims to get about half the money from U.S. investors as it plots a long-term expansion there after pushing further into Southeast Asia, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Line is already profitable and it will make that a focus for investors when it begins a roadshow toward the end of this month, according to one of the people. If it reaches its goals, Line would be this year’s biggest tech offering globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, providing a rare bright spot for the moribund market for listings. No business has raised more than $150 million in a technology IPO in 2016, even though more than 160 private companies are currently valued at $1 billion or more. The market debut would come two years after Line filed an application to list in Tokyo in July 2014. That offering valued the company at 1 trillion yen ($9.2 billion), people familiar with the situation said at the time. A deal didn’t materialize and the company, controlled by South Korea’s Naver Corp., later replaced its chief executive officer. Naver shares, which aren’t trading on Monday due to a national holiday, are up 7.4 percent this year.The lower valuation for next month’s expected listing reflects the company’s slowing user growth and a cooling in technology valuations and listings. Global tech companies raised about $900 million in the first quarter of this year, down from $6.5 billion during same period in 2014 and $2.8 billion in the first quarter of last year, according to Ernst & Young LLP. This year’s biggest tech listing is Australia’s WiseTech Global Ltd., a logistics software company that raised about $130 million in April, according to Bloomberg data.\n",

      "Japan’s Line Corp. is headed for what could be the biggest initial public offering for a technology company this year, including a major pitch to American investors. The company behind one of Asia’s most popular messaging apps plans to go public in Tokyo and New York in mid-to-late July, with a goal of raising between $1 billion and $2 billion at a valuation of $5 billion to $6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. The Tokyo-based company aims to get about half the money from U.S. investors as it plots a long-term expansion there after pushing further into Southeast Asia, said the people, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Line is already profitable and it will make that a focus for investors when it begins a roadshow toward the end of this month, according to one of the people. If it reaches its goals, Line would be this year’s biggest tech offering globally, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, providing a rare bright spot for the moribund market for listings. No business has raised more than $150 million in a technology IPO in 2016, even though more than 160 private companies are currently valued at $1 billion or more. The market debut would come two years after Line filed an application to list in Tokyo in July 2014. That offering valued the company at 1 trillion yen ($9.2 billion), people familiar with the situation said at the time. A deal didn’t materialize and the company, controlled by South Korea’s Naver Corp., later replaced its chief executive officer. Naver shares, which aren’t trading on Monday due to a national holiday, are up 7.4 percent this year.The lower valuation for next month’s expected listing reflects the company’s slowing user growth and a cooling in technology valuations and listings. Global tech companies raised about $900 million in the first quarter of this year, down from $6.5 billion during same period in 2014 and $2.8 billion in the first quarter of last year, according to Ernst & Young LLP. This year’s biggest tech listing is Australia’s WiseTech Global Ltd., a logistics software company that raised about $130 million in April, according to Bloomberg data.\n",

      "T-Mobile is giving every customer a share of its stock: T-Mobile had another of its un-carrier events today, which now have so many regular giveaways they are starting to look like an episode of Oprah. First, the company announced that every current T-Mobile account holder on a postpaid plan will get one share of common stock in the company, which is currently worth about $43. New qualifying customers will also get one share once they sign up with T-Mobile. Plus, existing customers will be able to earn another free share (or two if you’ve been a customer for over five years) for each new customer they refer to the company — maxing out at 100 shares a year. The prospectus for the offering is here, and gives a little more color on how exactly the promotion will work. Once a customer redeems the share via T-Mobile’s new app, the security will be held in a brokerage account at LOYAL3 Securities. Stockholders can then hold on to their new investment, sell their shares via the platform or transfer their shares to another brokerage account. Customers can even electronically participate in proxy votes to vote their shares. Notably, instead of issuing additional shares, T-Mobile says shares needed to meet the needs of the program will be purchased on the open markets.WeWork Is Cutting About 7% of Staff: WeWork, the world’s largest shared-workspace startup, plans to cut about 7 percent of its staff and has instituted a temporary pause on hiring, according to e-mails obtained by Bloomberg. The cutbacks come just three months after the New York company said it raised a round of $430 million led by Chinese investors. Managers were instructed to begin dismissals this week, said one of the e-mails. The startup, which lets members rent desks in an open office, ballooned from about 230 employees early last year to more than 1,000 today, according to research firm Mattermark. WeWork said it hired 175 people in May and expects to add about 500 employees by the end of the year. The company said it expects to lift the pause on hiring as soon as next week. The funding round in March valued WeWork at $16 billion with a focus on financing expansion throughout Asia, people familiar with the matter said at the time. WeWork's valuation is more than those of major landlords such as SL Green Realty Corp., which has a market value of $10.6 billion. Boston Properties Inc., the largest U.S. publicly traded office landlord, is valued at $19.6 billion.Nest CEO Tony Fadell is out: Tony Fadell, the CEO and co-founder of Nest, is leaving the company two years after his connected device firm was acquired by Google. Fadell announced his departure in a tweet on Friday, capping off a rocky tenure under the search giant, which reorganized itself as Alphabet in August and placed Fadell at the helm of his independent company. Marwan Fawaz, a former Motorola executive and adviser to the home security company ADT, is joining as Nest CEO. The move comes after a series of public dramas and critical departures at Nest, which has failed to meet initial expectations since Google acquired it for over $3 billion two years ago. As we reported, Nest brought in around $340 million in revenue last year — short of the goals set before the company acquired the videocamera startup Dropcam. That acquisition, by all measures, went terribly: Most of the Dropcam team departed, largely due to the frustrations of working under Fadell. Dropcam CEO Greg Duffy voiced those frustrations very publicly, writing that he regretted selling his company to Nest and Google. Fadell will stay on as an adviser to Larry Page, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, the company said in a statement. Several sources have said that a major issue for Nest was the integration of corporate cultures. Fadell, a former Apple executive, brought several others from that company and tried to retain Apple's unique, tenacious culture. That often clashed with Google's more open, experimental ethos, a fact that many Googlers noted often in many forums.No Uber IPO in Sight After $3.5 Billion From Saudi Arabia: Once upon a time, Silicon Valley startups raised money from venture capitalists and then, with some luck and a promising business, held an IPO to cash in and expand. Uber has no need for such traditions. The San Francisco-based company, founded in 2009 and valued at $62.5 billion, has now raised $11 billion as it spends heavily to expand globally and battle well-funded rivals such as Lyft Inc. and China’s Didi. The ride-hailing company’s latest infusion of cash -- a record $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund -- means Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick has the finances to continue avoiding a listing of his company any time soon. \"I’m going to make sure it happens as late as possible,\" he told CNBC earlier this year. The money from Saudi Arabia is a new wrinkle in the shifting way the world’s largest technology startups are being funded. The $3.5 billion raised by Uber Technologies Inc. this week is far larger than what most companies are able raise when they hold public offerings: Twitter Inc. netted $1.82 billion during its 2013 IPO and First Data Corp. raised $2.56 billion in the largest technology IPO of the past 12 months. In 2004, Google raised $1.67 billion during its stock-market debut.Uber Turns to Saudi Arabia for $3.5 Billion Cash Infusion: In its quest to build a global empire, Uber has turned to the Middle East for its biggest infusion of cash from a single investor. Uber said on Wednesday that it had raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s main investment fund. The money was part of the ride-hailing giant’s most recent financing round and continued to value the company at $62.5 billion. The investment does not cash out any of Uber’s existing investors.Uber, which has viewed the Middle East as an important area in its expansion, said the investment further aligned the company with Saudi Arabia as the kingdom planned to transform its economy, reducing its dependence on oil and improving employment. The investment from Saudi Arabia is one of the biggest single investments collected by the technology world’s top privately held companies. Uber, whose valuation makes it Silicon Valley’s most valuable private business, has collected billions at a rapid clip over the last three years. Uber has drawn from a wide variety of investors, including traditional venture capital firms, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Other sovereign wealth funds like that of Qatar have also invested. Other smaller tech companies have not fared as well in raising money over the last several months. Some so-called unicorns, the term used to refer to businesses valued at more than $1 billion, have struggled to collect new investments, and some, like Jawbone, have had to raise money at lower valuations. Uber is racing to defend its territory — which covers 460 cities in more than 69 countries — against incumbents in other regions like Southeast Asia and Europe. China, in particular, is a difficult battleground, as Uber is spending millions in a subsidy war with Didi Chuxing, the dominant ride-hailing start-up in the country. Both companies have made no indications that they will back down. Though Uber dominates the American market for ride-hailing, it has increasingly seen overseas markets as crucial to its growth. Among Uber’s increasingly important overseas markets is the Middle East, where the company has already said it plans to invest $250 million. The service operates in 15 cities and nine countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia.No Venture Capital Needed, or Wanted: The business world is filled with starry-eyed entrepreneurs who hope that the blessings of angel investors and venture capitalists will transform their start-up dreams into companies with billion-dollar valuations. But some successful start-ups have been bucking the trend by growing and expanding without taking a dime from major outside equity investors.Those who buck the odds by “bootstrapping” their own enterprises are rare, experts say. “It’s a huge anomaly,” said Mark Walsh, head of innovation and investment at the Small Business Administration He estimated that as few as one in 50 brick-and-mortar companies and one in 10 online companies could build their businesses into $50 million or $100 million enterprises on their own. But taking venture capital can be risky. In their haste to get financing, start-up founders often fail to read the fine print and later discover that they have signed away huge shares of the profits. In some cases, founders may be removed by the board of their own companies by the time the businesses are rapidly growing or plan to go public. For these reasons, some founders opt to take debt capital from banks and investors instead of giving away equity.Elizabeth Holmes, Founder of Theranos, Falls From Highest Perch Off Forbes List: Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of the blood testing company Theranos, was a rare breed, something more rare than even the Silicon Valley unicorn she created: a self-made female billionaire. Forbes, the business publication that has made a franchise of cataloging the rich, had put Ms. Holmes on the top of its list last year of America’s richest self-made women.The magazine’s new estimated tally of her wealth? It went from $4.5 billion to $0. Ms. Holmes’s unusual status, as a young woman who created and controlled a company seemingly valued at about $9 billion, captivated the media: She graced countless magazine covers, including T: The New York Times Style Magazine. Theranos, she said, would revolutionize the lab industry by offering blood tests from a single finger prick at a fraction of the cost of traditional testing. But over the last year, Theranos became the subject of a series of hard-hitting Wall Street Journal articles and intense regulatory scrutiny from an array of federal agencies. The media is now mesmerized by Ms. Holmes’s fall. Truth be told, the half of the $9 billion valuation ascribed to Theranos and previously listed as Ms. Holmes’s wealth was nothing more than an estimate based on investors’ best guesses. Taking into account all the controversy and uncertainty surrounding the value of the company’s top-secret technology, Forbes is now guessing that the company is worth more like $800 million. While Ms. Holmes still owns at least half of the company, much of that value would be tied up with outside investors.Not surprisingly, Theranos refused to shed any light on the matter, except to dispute Forbes’s analysis.Early days, but Apple Pay struggles outside U.S.: More than 18 months after Apple Pay took the United States by storm, the smartphone giant has made only a small dent in the global payments market, snagged by technical challenges, low consumer take-up and resistance from banks. The service is available in six countries and among a limited range of banks, though in recent weeks Apple has added four banks to its sole Singapore partner American Express; Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in Australia; and Canada's five big banks. Apple Pay usage totaled $10.9 billion last year, the vast majority of that in the United States. That is less than the annual volume of transactions in Kenya, a mobile payments pioneer, according to research firm Timetric. And its global turnover is a drop in the bucket in China, where Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent dominate the world's biggest mobile payments market - with an estimated $1 trillion worth of mobile transactions last year, according to iResearch data. Anecdotal evidence from Britain, China and Australia suggests Apple Pay is popular with core Apple followers, but the quality of service, and interest in it, varies significantly. To use Apple Pay, consumers tap their iPhone over payment terminals to buy coffee, train tickets and other services. It can be also used at vending machines that accept contactless payments. Apple Pay transactions were a fraction of the $84.5 billion in iPhone sales for the six months to March, which accounted for two-thirds of Apple's total revenue.Singapore buys $1 billion in Alibaba stock in SoftBank sale: Singapore sovereign wealth funds bought $1 billion of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's shares as part of an $8.9 billion sale by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, Alibaba's biggest shareholder, the company said on Wednesday. Singapore's GIC Private, Ltd and Temasek Holdings each purchased $500 million of Alibaba shares at $74.00 apiece through subsidiaries, Alibaba said, offering details of the SoftBank sale announced on Tuesday. Alibaba purchased $2 billion of its own stock at the same price, in a move which would add to earnings, Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai told analysts on a call. Members of the Alibaba Partnership of senior executives and founders purchased another $400 million, as expected, at the $74 per share price, he added. SoftBank also offered $5.5 billion in debt securities, which can be exchanged for Alibaba stock in three years, Tsai said. SoftBank Group said on Tuesday it would sell at least $7.9 billion of shares in Alibaba to cut the Japanese company's debt. It said it would remain Alibaba's largest shareholder after the sale. Shares of Alibaba fell about 6.5 percent to close at $76.69.Why you should delete the online accounts you don’t use anymore — right now: Despite falling out of vogue years ago, MySpace — that old precursor to Facebook — still has details on more user accounts than the United States has people. And now a hefty chunk of those account credentials has been leaked to the entire Internet, in a humbling reminder that the Matchbox Twenty-inspired username you probably made in high school is still worth a heck of a lot to companies and criminals. As many as 360 million MySpace accounts turned up for sale Friday in a 33-gigabyte dump online, according to reports that were confirmed Monday by MySpace's parent, Time Inc. The massive leak includes passwords, email addresses and usernames that were swiped from MySpace in a hack dating back to June 2013, before MySpace made a site redesign that closed some security gaps. It's unclear how many of the accounts in the MySpace hack were still \"active,\" in the sense that they belong to people who continue to log into the service today. But chances are at least some of these accounts hadn't been touched for years. The reason this makes you vulnerable is the same reason experts say you shouldn't use the same username and password for every online service — it makes it easy to take one set of stolen credentials and plug them into others, giving hackers potential access to large swaths of your digital life. Personal data from the MySpace breach was going for sale to the tune of thousands of dollars, highlighting how even outdated information can still carry significant value. But whether your old data gets used for marketing, fraud or some other nefarious purpose is still at least partly within your control.Inside Uber’s Auto-Lease Machine, Where Almost Anyone Can Get a Car: In its relentless pursuit for growth, Uber needs new drivers, and many of those drivers need cars. To help them get started, Uber has been offering short-term leases since July through a wholly owned Delaware-based subsidiary called Xchange Leasing, LLC. It partners with auto dealerships, advertises to drivers, manages risk, and even pays repo men to chase down cars whose drivers aren't making their payments. Xchange may be key to Uber's continued expansion as it tangles with Lyft in the U.S. and a bevy of competitors abroad. Uber announced a partnership with Toyota last week to finance even more cars. This year, Uber said its financing and discount programs, which include Xchange, will put more than 100,000 drivers on the road. That requires dipping into the vast pool of people with bad or no credit. In a deal led by Goldman Sachs, Xchange received a $1 billion credit facility to fund new car leases, according to a person familiar with the matter. The deal will help Uber grow its U.S. subprime auto leasing business and it will give many of the world's biggest financial institutions exposure to the company's auto leases.  The credit facility is basically a line of credit that Xchange can use to lease out cars to Uber drivers.Microsoft sells patents to Xiaomi, builds 'long-term partnership': Software maker Microsoft  is selling about 1,500 of its patents to Chinese device maker Xiaomi [XTC.UL], a rare departure for the U.S. company and part of what the two companies say is the start of a long-term partnership. The deal, announced on Wednesday, also includes a patent cross-licensing arrangement and a commitment by Xiaomi to install copies of Microsoft software, including Office and Skype, on its phones and tablets. Both companies declined to discuss financial terms of the deal.  Jonathan Tinter, corporate vice president at Microsoft, said the company was keen to tap into Xiaomi's young, affluent and educated users by having its products pre-installed on their devices. He declined to go into detail about the patent deals, but said the overall deal was something \"we do only with a few strategic partners.\" Microsoft has cut licensing deals with many Android device makers over the years, but has had less luck with Chinese manufacturers. Florian Mueller, a patents expert who consulted for Microsoft in the past, said it was rare for Microsoft to actually sell its patents, adding \"it's possible Microsoft found it easier to impose its Android patent tax on Xiaomi as part of a broader deal that also involved a transfer of patents.\" The military’s stealth motorcycles are as quiet as an electric toothbrush: The military is funding stealth motorcycles, which would allow riders to quickly sneak up on unsuspecting enemies. The motorcycles operate at 55 decibels — about the level of an electric toothbrush or typical conversation — yet still can reach 80 mph in speed. The extreme quiet is due to the use of electric motors. The motorcycles also feature two-wheel drive to improve traction on gravel, sand or any challenging terrain. The narrow dimensions of the motorcycles allow them to be driven in forests or other places some military vehicles can’t go.The electric motors have limited range — the SilentHawk lasts two hours and the other bike, NightMare, has 60 miles of power. So the motorcycles are modified with hybrid engines that can burn almost any type of fuel, such as gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene or diesel. The thinking is these hybrid engines, which are about as loud as a vacuum cleaner, can be used on the part of a mission where being quiet isn’t essential. Using the back-up engine increases the SilentHawk’s range to 170 miles.VR Experience From McDonald's Lets You Watch Life-Size Angry Birds Take Over a Restaurant: McDonald's ald's has partnered with Sony and Rovio, the creator of Angry Birds, to create a 360-degree video promoting the upcoming feature film The Angry Birds Movie. The 60-second spot puts the viewer in the center of a McDonald's restaurant, as the film's feathered flying stars zip in the air from table to table, dance in the aisles and take selfies with dining families. The film was created in partnership with DDB Chicago and has racked up more than 4.5 million views in less than a week. According to John Maxham, chief creative officer at DDB Chicago, it's the first 360-degree video for McDonald's (unless you count the VR Happy Meal painting activation during SXSW). Maxham said it's also the first time a 360-degree film has been shot for any quick service restaurant. To combine animation with reality, DDB Chicago worked with Rovio for the animations using pre-existing bird assets and with Optimist to stitch everything together. According to Shelby Georgis, DDB's creative director, the trick was choreographing animations ahead of time so that the actors were set to work on a specific cadence that makes it look like they're interacting with the animals.China to open e-commerce, other sectors to foreign investment: newspaper: China will lift restrictions to investments by foreign firms in a range of service industry sectors, including e-commerce, logistics, accounting and auditing, the China Securities News quoted commerce minister Gao Hucheng as saying. Gao said China would also promote the orderly opening of other service fields including finance, education, culture and health care, the report published on Saturday said without elaborating or giving a time-frame. China's trade in services would exceed $1 trillion by 2020, the minister predicted. The Ministry of Commerce has previously said the value of China's services trade was expected to exceed $750 billion this year.Thiel-Gawker Fight Raises Concerns About Press Freedom: The story of Gawker versus Hulk Hogan — or, perhaps more accurately, Peter Thiel — has some asking whether press freedom in the United States is in peril if a scorned billionaire can help deliver a crippling blow to a media company. But since Mr. Thiel spoke to The New York Times on Wednesday about his reasons for funding the lawsuit against Gawker, the debate surrounding the dispute has expanded to encompass ideological battles in media, technology and politics. A variety of observers, including other billionaires and figures involved in GamerGate, have entered into the fray to address themes like Mr. Thiel’s political motivations, and the wider issue of Silicon Valley power players and their involvement with the news media. Several journalists felt that Mr. Thiel’s political views and connection withDonald J. Trump, the Republican presidential front-runner, could be worrisome based on Mr. Trump’s previous comments about changing libel laws to make it easier to sue media outlets.Google Prevails as Jury Rebuffs Oracle in Code Copyright Case: A jury ruled in favor of Google on Thursday in a long legal dispute withOracle over software used to power most of the world’s smartphones. Oracle contended that Google used copyrighted material in 11,000 of its 13 million lines of software code in Android, its mobile phone operating system. Oracle asked for $9 billion from Google. Google said it made fair use of that code and owed nothing. The victory for Google cheered other software developers, who operate much the way Google did when it comes to so-called open-source software. Unlike traditional software created by corporations and tightly held, open-source products are released, often with some restrictions, for anyone to use and modify. “Great news for progress and innovation,” Chris Dixon, a technology investor with Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, posted on Twitter after the verdict. Android relies in part on Java, an open-source software language that Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion in 2010. Oracle argued that Google executives violated Oracle’s copyright by using aspects of Java without permission. The courtroom fight was something of a watershed for technology and could offer clarity on legal rules surrounding open-source technology, which is used in everything from smartphones and digital recording devices to the software that runs many of the world’s biggest data centers. People who work with open-source technology worried that a victory for Oracle would have led other companies to make similar demands of open-source products. “It does give a lot of breathing room to other companies and individuals trying to do a lot of innovative activity,” said Parker Higgins, director of copyright activism at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group.Bessemer-Backed Twilio Files for Initial Public Offering: Twilio Inc., the San Francisco-based company that helps clients including Uber Technologies Inc. build web and mobile applications, filed for an initial public offering. The software developer, backed by Bessemer Venture Partners, filed with an initial offering size of $100 million, a placeholder amount used to calculate fees that will probably change. Twilio had more than 28,000 active customers at the end of March, according to the prospectus filed Thursday. They include enterprise-software company Box Inc., department-store chain Nordstrom Inc. and rideshare company Uber. Twilio said in the filing its communications software is embedded in Uber’s mobile app, helping it update riders in real-time about their ride requests as well as helping the company scale its business. Bessemer holds a stake of 28.5 percent in Twilio, according to the prospectus. Union Square Ventures holds 13.6 percent and Fidelity owns 6.1 percent. Twilio has yet to make a profit. It posted a net loss of about $36 million in 2015, on sales of $167 million, even as revenue grew 88 percent that year after a 78 percent bump in 2014. The company said that it expects its growth rate to decline over time. WhatsApp Inc. contributed a significant chunk of that revenue. The messaging tool owned by Facebook Inc. uses Twilio’s technology in its applications to verify new and existing users. WhatsApp accounted for 17 percent of Twilio’s sales last year and 15 percent in the first three months of 2016.Snapchat raises $1.81 billion in new funding round: Messaging app Snapchat has raised $1.81 billion in funding, the company reported in a U.S. regulatory filing on Thursday, a sign that investor interest is strong despite concerns among some venture capitalists that the platform is struggling to attract advertisers. Venture capital database PitchBook estimated the company's valuation after the financing at $17.81 billion, up from $16 billion at it most recent financing in February.Snapchat, headquartered in Venice, California, has faced concerns from big investors familiar with the company that its estimated valuation is not justified because of an uneven revenue stream. Its advertising business, which began last October, is the company's only significant revenue source. But, with a strong user base of 13- to 24-year-olds, the app provides an attractive platform to reach millennials and hook young consumers on brands. The company has more than 100 million active users, about 60 percent of whom are 13- to 24-year-olds. Snapchat early this year raised $175 million from Fidelity Investments in a \"flat round\" of financing that did not adjust the company's valuation. The mutual fund bought shares at $30.72 each. Fidelity has repeatedly adjusted the estimated valuation of its stake in the company, slashing it by at least 25 percent last year only to boost it by more than 60 percent in February. Investors in this latest round include General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and Lone Pine, among others, tech blog TechCrunch reported on Thursday. TechCrunch also reported that Snapchat's revenues in 2015 were $59 million, according to a presentation to investors that was seen by the news site. That's up from $3.1 million for the first 11 months of 2014, sources told Reuters last year.InMobi grapples with senior, mid-level attrition amid concerns about future: Online advertising startup InMobi , one of India's early 'unicorns,' is struggling to retain senior executives amid questions about whether new strategic initiatives are working as well as worries about the future of the company. InMobi, which was founded by Naveen Tewari in 2007 and was the first startup in which Japan's SoftBank invested, now has some 1,500 employees compared to twice that number at its peak. The Japanese conglomerate, which has since backed Snapdeal and Ola, poured $200 million into InMobi in 2011 but wrote down most of that amount in 2014. The exits also come during a time when InMobi is struggling to raise funds and chart out a sustainable business model that can adapt to the massive changes that are taking place in the online and mobile advertising space, according to both current and former executives at the company. According to these executives, InMobi, which was estimated to be valued at $1 billion, now generates between around $300 million in annual revenue. InMobi has not registered profits since its founding in 2007. InMobi's challenges have been compounded by the fact that its flagship product Miip -- that targeted global retailers like Walmart -- hasn't taken off. Miip also took much longer than expected to scale and customers found the product underwhelming, according to at least two customers who have used the product.Alibaba Facing SEC Investigation Over Accounting Practices: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. fell the most in four months after the e-commerce giant said it’s being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices and whether they violate federal laws. The company is providing documents and cooperating with the probe, according to the Hangzhou, China-based company’s annual report. The investigation is looking into consolidation practices, related party transactions and data reported from its Singles’ Day promotion. Singles’ Day is Alibaba’s biggest shopping day, attracting more than 90 billion yuan ($13.7 billion) of sales on its e-commerce platforms in a 24-hour period last year. Alibaba fell 6.8 percent to $75.59, the biggest drop since January. It was down less than 1 percent this year through Tuesday.In Silicon Valley, Gossip, Anger and Revenge: Silicon Valley likes to keep the media on a tight leash. Tech executives expect obedience, if not reverence, from reporters. They dole out information as grudgingly as possible. Sometimes they simply buy a chunk of a publication, a time-honored method of influencing what is deemed fit to write about. Valleywag declined to play the game. It was a gossip sheet for the digital age: abrasive, knowing, cynical, self-promoting, sometimes unfair. It dispensed snark by the truckload, printing things that people knew or surmised but were off the table. It said Google co-founder Larry Page had dated his then-colleague, Marissa Mayer. That the Google chairman Eric Schmidt was a playboy and a scamp. That the Napster co-founder and early Facebook executive Sean Parker’s wedding was seriously over the top. Most notoriously, at least in retrospect, the tech gossip blog said in late 2007 that Peter Thiel, who co-founded PayPal and was an early and significant investor in Facebook, was gay. This was gossip with an attitude, and an agenda. And what it unleashed was Mr. Thiel’s ire. He secretly financed a suit brought by the wrestler Hulk Hogan against Valleywag’s parent, Gawker Media, which has resulted in $140 million in damages. Gawker is appealing. The revelation of Mr. Thiel’s involvement in the suit this week brings the complicated relationship of Silicon Valley and the media once again to the forefront. The technology world is ever more important and richer, with smartphones in everyone’s pocket conveying a stream of news that Silicon Valley not only delivers, but helps shape. At the same time, the tech companies are less transparent about what they do.Salesforce inks deal with AWS to expand international presence: AWS announced today that it was expanding its relationship with Salesforce.com, with Salesforce naming the cloud giant a preferred cloud provider. The agreement should help Salesforce increase its international presence without having to build its own data centers in countries that have data sovereignty laws, which require that data stays in-country. It’s expensive to build their own, so they are turning to a public cloud infrastructure provider like Amazon to do the heavy lifting for them. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff spoke glowingly of AWS. “There is no public cloud infrastructure provider that is more sophisticated or has more robust enterprise capabilities for supporting the needs of our growing global customer base,” he said in a statement. It’s worth keeping in mind, however that Salesforce also has a deep relationship with Microsoft — and CEO Satya Nadella appeared on stage at Dreamforce, Salesforce’s massive customer conference last fall. But the relationship has a flip side and the companies also compete with one another. R Ray Wang, who is principal at Constellation Research, points out that this announcement should help Salesforce compete with Oracle and Microsoft overseas.Terrapattern is reverse image search for maps, powered by a neural network: Terrapattern is a visual search engine that, from the first moment you use it, you wonder: Why didn’t Google come up with this 10 years ago? Click on a feature on the map — a baseball diamond, a marina, a roundabout — and it immediately highlights everything its algorithm thinks looks like it. It’s remarkably fast, simple to use and potentially very powerful. Go ahead and give it a try first to see how natural it is to search for something. How does that work? And how did a handful of digital artists and developers create it — and for under $35,000? The secret, as with so many other interesting visual computing projects these days, is a convolutional neural network. It’s essentially an AI-like program that extracts every little detail from an image and looks for patterns at various levels of organization — similar to how our own visual system works, though the brain is infinitely more subtle and flexible. In Terrapattern’s case, the neural network was trained to look at small squares of the landscape and, comparing those patterns to a huge database of tagged map features from OpenStreetMap, it learned to associate them with certain concepts. Think of how a camera recognizes a face and knows when it is blinking or smiling. It doesn’t actually “know” what faces, smiles and eyes are, but it associates them with certain patterns of pixels, and can reliably pick them out. Once Terrapattern had been trained to recognize and categorize all manner of geographical features, from boats to water towers, its creators set it free on detailed maps of the greater New York, Pittsburgh, Detroit and San Francisco areas. It scoured the landscape and built a huge database of features and similarities — which can be quickly queried and the results returned immediately (the neural network isn’t doing any “thinking” when you click on a feature — its work is done for this dataset). Of course, you could just search for “tennis fields in Oakland” or the like and get perfectly good results, but this allows one to search for things that may not be listed so formally. What if you were looking for houses in the middle of fields, or cul de sacs, or dead lawns, or circular parking lots? Terrapattern knows where those are just as much as it knows where the airports and ferry terminals are. They’re all just assemblages of features to the neural network.Microsoft is giving up on consumer smartphones, too: The company is taking a $950 million charge to unwind the last vestiges of the Nokia deal. Microsoft is further scaling back its flagging phone business, exiting the consumer market and cutting another 1,850 jobs. As part of the move announced Wednesday, Microsoft will take a $950 million charge and cut what little remained of its Finland-based phone hardware business, unwinding the last of its disastrous $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia's phone unit. Last week, Microsoft announced separately that it was selling what was left of its low-end\"feature phone\" business.  The company has been scaling back its phone ambitions ever since the Nokia deal closed, with CEO Satya Nadella quickly shifting to a strategy focused on bringing Microsoft's software and services to Android and iOS rather than trying to convince phone buyers to shift to Windows. Despite all the cuts — and having already seen its market share dip below 1 percent — Microsoft says it isn't totally out of the phone-making business. The company insists it will continue to serve phones aimed at the business market and license Windows 10 to any other hardware makers that want to give Windows Phone a try.Toyota and Volkswagen Step Up Investments in Tech Start-Ups: On Tuesday, two of the world’s largest automakers, Toyota and Volkswagen, said they were stepping up to invest in technology start-ups that are working to change the way people travel by car. Toyota said it had formed a partnership with and invested an undisclosed amount in Uber, the biggest ride-hailing company. Gett, the app popular in Europe, said it was working with Volkswagen, and the automaker was investing $300 million in the start-up. The alliances are the latest in a string of pairings between technology companies and traditional automakers that are scrambling to reposition themselves. For decades, automakers had abided by the well-worn formula of making bigger and more powerful cars to fuel their growth. But start-ups like Uber and Lyft and technology companies like Google and Tesla have disrupted that cadence. These companies, mostly located in Silicon Valley, have in the last few years sped the development of self-driving cars, electric vehicles and ride services. Automakers have become increasingly concerned about those technologies and their potential to help people travel easily and cheaply without owning a car — or even without knowing how to drive. In January, General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft, the ride-hailing app popular with American users, with a focus on developing networks of autonomous vehicles. Ford Motor is making over its Dearborn, Mich., headquarters into a Silicon Valley-like campus of green buildings connected by self-driving shuttles. And a few weeks ago, Fiat Chrysler and Google agreed to produce a test fleet of driverless minivans. Both BMW and Mercedes-Benz have started to pilot ride services. Even other technology companies only tangentially related to automobiles are becoming more involved in ride services. Apple, which is working on its own autos project, said this month it had invested $1 billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese ride-hailing company that competes fiercely with Uber.French Tax Investigators Swoop on Google’s Paris Offices: French police and prosecutors swooped on Google’s Paris offices on Tuesday, intensifying a tax-fraud probe amid accusations across Europe that the Internet giant fails to pay its fair share. The raids are part of preliminary criminal investigation opened in June 2015 after French tax authorities lodged a complaint, according to a statement from the nation’s financial prosecutor. The probe is seeking to verify whether Google’s Irish unit has permanent establishment in France and whether the firm failed to declare part of its revenues in France. Prosecutors will probably go after Google’s management in Ireland, according to Alain Frenkel, a tax lawyer in Paris. “That doesn’t mean Google won’t also face a recovery order from France’s tax authorities,” he said in a phone interview. The raids come as Google, which is part of parent company Alphabet Inc., faces outrage in Europe over the small amount of tax it pays in the region. France has called on the company to pay back taxes of about 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion). While no one has been charged of any wrongdoing, French penalties for aggravated tax fraud have recently been ramped up. Convicted managers can potentially face as long as 7 years in jail and a 2 million-euro fine.Hewlett Packard Enterprise will spin off its troubled services business in an $8.5 billion deal: Six months after the Silicon Valley stalwart Hewlett-Packard split into two companies, one half announced a surprise plan to split yet again. Hewlett Packard Enterprise said it will spin off its long-troubled services unit and merge it with the IT services firm CSC in a deal worth about $8.5 billion. The complex deal, in which HPE will combine its $20 billion Enterprise Services unit — accounting for more than one third of HPE's 2015 revenue — with CSC into a combined company of which HPE shareholders will end up owning about half. The total consideration of the deal includes the creation of $4.5 billion of new shares, a cash dividend worth $1.5 billion, and the transfer of about $2.5 billion in debt and other liabilities off HPE's books and into the new company. HPE also expects to trim its operating costs by about $1 billion as a result of the spinoff. What will remain at HPE is a leaner $32 billion company that leads the world in sales of servers, the computers that are stacked together in data center racks that power the Internet. It competes with networking giant Cisco Systems in selling gear for corporate networks, with EMC in data storage gear, and also sports a small software business that did about $3.6 billion in sales last year. The new company — HPE and CSC are calling it Spinco for now — will be a pure player in the low-margin, IT outsourcing market that had been a shrinking, expensive weight around the old HP's neck during the time it was struggling to bounce back. Revenue in the unit has declined for several years, during years that its customers went through wrenching changes in how they purchase and consume technology. The move will also unwind what in hindsight has turned out to be one of the worst acquisitions in the old HP's history, the $14 billion acquisition of the IT services firm EDS, consummated in 2008 under yet another prior HP CEO, Mark Hurd, now the CEO of Oracle.Snapchat is raising more money around $20 billion valuation: Snapchat may have first made its name in the crowded world of mobile apps with an ephemeral messaging service, but the startup and its wildly popular app are not disappearing anywhere soon. TechCrunch has learned from multiple sources that Snapchat is raising yet more financing at around a $20 billion valuation. Sources with knowledge of the deal say the social media giant is in the process of a round of about $200 million. This new financing, we understand, is a follow-on to the $175 million Series F round led by Fidelity. Snapchat was said to be valued at $16 billion in that round, flat on the year before. However, filings from earlier this month and embedded below, uncovered for us by market analysts VC Experts, show that the Series F was expanded.Expanding the Series F with a Series FP, as it’s described in the document below, would also fit in with a description we’ve heard more than once about Snapchat’s fundraising: The startup is “always raising” on a “rolling” basis, partly because investors are so interested. “They get offers all the time,” one investor close to the company said. “And once you start to grow on this path, many people come to give you money. You don’t know how to value the company, so the best way to do that is to do some kind of rolling funding. When you have a hot company and many people are approaching you, you do a market of discovery.” That may be different from other startups, but in a way it reflects Snapchat’s own fast growth and its taste for trying out new things like QR codes to connect to accounts and content, their crazy face-changing filters and more.To halt smartphone slide, Samsung rewrites playbook: From the way it chooses smartphone components to the models it brings to market, Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) has undergone a painful process of breaking from its past to reverse a slide in its handset business. For example, the world's largest smartphone maker agonized over camera specs for its flagship Galaxy S7 until the last moment - ultimately defying industry convention by opting for fewer pixels in exchange for improved autofocus features and low-light performance, a move that contributed to early success. It also pared back its product line-up, overcoming internal resistance, enabling it to streamline production, an executive said. The handset business has now stabilized, and had its best profit in nearly two years in January-March, though historically low smartphone industry growth still leaves Samsung looking for the \"next big thing\". After peaking in 2013, a sharp drop in mobile profits exposed Samsung as slow to adjust to the changing market: its budget devices were overpriced and unappealing versus Chinese offerings, and the 2014 version of its Galaxy S flopped. That prompted a cull among executives and stoked investor worries Samsung might not be able to recover as rivals including Apple, Huawei  and Xiaomi gained market share at its expense. There was no sweeping, across-the-board fix. Rather, Samsung embarked two years ago on an overhaul that included a shift from a phone-for-all-needs approach towards a line-up that emphasized economies of scale. It revamped design, using metal frames and curved screens, and gave high-end features such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens to its low- and mid-tier products. The product cull paid off; the revamped models helped Samsung recover in big markets such as India. \"There was a feeling the sheer number of phones in the market was confusing for customers,\" said a Samsung India executive, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with the media.Samsung's Kim says his focus now is on premium-end smartphones - those costing $600 and above - where not all industry players have the muscle to compete.Selling Uber Shares May Be Tougher Than You Think: SharesPost Inc., a broker of private technology stocks, approached investors with what seemed like an alluring offer: a potential investment in a fund that would hold Uber Technologies Inc. shares. In exchange for exposure to the high-flying ride-hailing startup, they were asked to part with at least $100,000 each and agree to hold the stake until the company goes public or gets acquired, with no vote in business decisions or visibility into its operations or finances. But SharesPost said it called off the proposed deal. The plan was to purchase as much as $10 million in preferred shares from Uber’s most recent round of financing and package them in an investment fund to be sold at a premium, according to offering documents obtained by Bloomberg. SharesPost said it wouldn’t pursue the transaction, citing a “lack of investor interest.” “It became clear that the minimum funds would not be collected for this deal, and as a result, the sales team began to inform interested clients of this fact,” Greg Berardi, a spokesman for SharesPost, wrote in an e-mail. The erstwhile offering shows the complexity of giving investors the chance to gain shares in a startup that wants to tightly control who gets a sliver, no matter how small. Like many startups, Uber limits sales of its shares. Such transactions can distort a company's valuation, leave control in the hands of unknown investors and result in tax liabilities for the company, its employees and other shareholders. Uber declined to comment on the SharesPost proposal, but a spokeswoman said when Uber learns of potential unauthorized shares on the market, the company contacts the people involved. SharesPost's role in share sales has drawn regulatory scrutiny. The broker settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2012 to resolve claims that the online marketplace for private-company shares acted as an unregistered broker. SharesPost paid $80,000 and Greg Brogger, then the company’s president, paid $20,000, without admitting wrongdoing. Brogger is now SharesPost’s chief executive officer and chairman, and the company is registered with the SEC. SharesPost's spokesman called the 2012 settlement “completely irrelevant to a 2016 fund that never got off the ground.” Speaking to a Silicon Valley audience in March, SEC Chair Mary Jo White cautioned that secondary transactions could amplify “errors or misconceptions in valuation.” She highlighted the lack of transparency in such deals as cause for concern. For the proposed Uber transaction, the documents said a fund managed by a member of SharesPost’s board of directors would buy the shares at a 2 percent premium to their price in last year’s funding round, which valued the company at $62.5 billion, and then resell them for 5 percent more. It’s unclear where the SharesPost fund would acquire the Uber stake from. VC Experts, a private-market research firm, estimated that the transaction would give Uber an implied valuation of more the $70 billion.Modi’s Mini-Shuttle Set to Blast Into Elon Musk’s Race for Space: India is set to launch a scale model of a reusable spacecraft on Monday, a project that in time could pit the nation against billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk in the race to make access to space cheaper and easier. The winged vessel -- one-fifth of full size -- is due to blast off on a rocket from Sriharikota base on the southeastern coast, reach an altitude of 70 kilometers (43 miles) and glide back at supersonic speeds to Earth for a splashdown in the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Space Research Organisation said.India put a probe into Mars orbit in 2014 for just $74 million, demonstrating a combination of technological capability and low costs that chimes with the goal of more frequent space travel being championed by Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Bezos’s Blue Origin LLC. Both companies seek to curb costs by making rockets reusable and are conducting test launches more often.India plans to spend about 75 billion rupees ($1.1 billion) on its entire space program in the year through March 2017, a fraction of the yearly $19-billion-dollar budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in the U.S.  The reusable space vehicle is supposed to provide a cost-effective and reliable option for operations such as launching satellites, according to the Indian space agency. Mock-upson government websites resemble the long-defunct NASA space shuttles.The nation remains about eight years away from a full-scale version of the reusable space vehicle, and still has to cross the hurdle of steering the vessel safely back to land rather than water, according to the Indian space agency. Musk’s SpaceX in December pulled off a soft, vertical touchdown after the two-stage rocket propelled its payload. Less than month earlier, Bezos sent one of his test rockets to the edge of space and landed it safely back on Earth. \"India has to start somewhere, sometime,\" Lele said. \"That time is now.\"Start-Ups Once Showered With Cash Now Have to Work for It: The balance of power is shifting across tech start-up land. Not long ago, entrepreneurs had the upper hand. With investors eager to get a piece of the next Uber or Airbnb, entrepreneurs often just lifted their little fingers to get financing. Some investors let the entrepreneurs choose their own terms, while others gave multimillion-dollar paydays to start-up founders long before their companies were a success. Now investors have the advantage. Instead of venture capitalists begging to be allowed to invest, entrepreneurs are coming to them begging for cash. Investors are exerting their newfound power by asking more questions about a start-up’s prospects and taking more time to invest. Some are pushing for management changes or for financing terms that would help cushion any losses they might face. “Venture capitalists are putting founders through everything short of a proctology exam before they invest,” said Venky Ganesan, a partner at Menlo Ventures, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm. The changing balance of power is evident in the numbers. Venture capitalists have put less money into start-ups in the United States in the last two quarters, according to the National Venture Capital Association; funding dropped 11 percent to $12.1 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier. With a smaller capital pie, entrepreneurs have to work harder for a piece. Investors have also been better able to negotiate financing terms that benefit them. According to a survey from the law firm Fenwick & West, investors of richly valued start-ups have been getting more provisions such as guaranteed payouts and minimum investment gains. Such terms are still relatively rare, but tend to become more common after the number and size of deals decline, said Barry Kramer, a Fenwick & West partner. Above all, investors are no longer paying any price to invest in a start-up. Since the beginning of this year, about 30 companies have had to settle for lower valuations than they previously received when they raised money, according to the research firm CB Insights. That is nearly as many as in all of 2015. “Investors have materially more time to do diligence than before,” said Ben Ling, a partner at venture capital firm Khosla Ventures. “Across our portfolio, even for the best companies, fund-raising is a longer process.”Warren Buffett Stake Suggests Apple Is All Grown Up: With this week’s imprimatur from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, it should now be official: Apple, the world’s largest company by market capitalization and a symbol of American technological innovation, is a “value” stock. That may prove to be a decidedly mixed blessing. Mr. Buffett is the world’s most prominent and successful proponent of value investing — an approach that seeks stocks that are undervalued and sell for less than their “intrinsic value,” as Benjamin Graham put it his 1949 classic “The Intelligent Investor.” Mr. Buffett credits Mr. Graham with shaping his own approach to investing. So value investors took notice when Mr. Buffett’s holding company,Berkshire Hathaway, disclosed it had invested $1 billion in Apple stock during the last quarter. “We’ve just looked at it again,” said Bill Smead, who manages the Smead Value Fund, one of the most successful large-cap value mutual funds over the last five years, according to Morningstar. “Anybody that discounts the thinking at Berkshire Hathaway does so at their peril, in my opinion.” Value stocks are typically unpopular among many investors, their shares often battered by disappointing short-term revenue and earnings results. They usually trade at very low price-to-earnings ratios, a common valuation measure. Nonetheless, some academic studies have suggested that over time, they outperform other stocks, in part because expectations are so low. Today there are numerous value investors, value mutual funds and value exchange-traded funds that pursue variations of the strategy, many of them probably now considering adding Apple to their portfolios, if they haven’t already. Apple “is going to attract more value investors,” said Toni Sacconaghi, a senior analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who covers Apple. “They’re looking for beaten-down stocks with negative sentiment. Apple has traded below a market multiple for years and sentiment has become increasingly pessimistic, especially over the past month.”Samsung to partner with Alibaba on mobile payments in China: Samsung Electronics said it had struck a deal with a Alibaba Group Holding for owners of its phones to be able to more easily make payments with Alipay accounts - a move it hopes will boost sales in the world's biggest smartphone market. Users of Samsung Pay will also have the option of paying with their Alipay accounts without having separately access the Alipay application. Alipay, which is operated by Alibaba unit Ant Financial Services Group, has 450 million active registered users. Samsung, the world's top smartphone maker, launched its own mobile payment system, Samsung Pay, in China in March, about one month after Apple Inc launched Apple Pay.But Alipay's dominant position has meant that it will be difficult for any latecomers in mobile payments to gain significant ground just on their own. Samsung has been losing out to Chinese rivals Huawei and Xiaomi as well as Apple and no longer ranks among the top five smartphone brands in China, according to market researcher Strategy Analytics.This $5 Billion Software Company Has No Sales Staff: Atlassian sold $320 million worth of business software last year without a single sales employee. Everyone else in the industry noticed.: Atlassian, which makes popular project-management and chat apps such as Jira and HipChat, doesn’t run on sales quotas and end-of-quarter discounts. In fact, its sales team doesn’t pitch products to anyone, because Atlassian doesn’t have a sales team. Initially an anomaly in the world of business software, the Australian company has become a beacon for other businesses counting on word of mouth to build market share. “Customers don’t want to call a salesperson if they don’t have to,” says Scott Farquhar, Atlassian’s co-chief executive officer. “They’d much rather be able to find the answers on the website.” The way technology companies sell software has changed dramatically in the past decade. The availability of open source alternatives has pushed traditional brands and rising challengers to offer more free trials, free basic versions of their software with paid upgrades, and online promotions. Incumbents such as IBM, Oracle, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which employ thousands of commissioned salespeople, are acquiring open source or cloud companies that sell differently, says Laurie Wurster, an analyst at researcher Gartner. Slack, Dropbox, and GitHub are among the companies trying to attract corporate clients with small-bore efforts that rely largely on good reviews. The idea is to distribute products to individuals or small groups at potential customers big and small and hope interest spreads upstairs. So far, though, Atlassian remains the most extreme example of this model. It’s a 14-year-old company, valued at $5 billion since going public in December, without a single salesperson on the payroll. More than 80 Fortune 100 companies use Atlassian’s software, and venture capitalists and peers often talk about trying to follow, at least partly, its sales strategy.Atlassian’s roots lie in Sydney’s barren tech scene. It was kept aloft early on not by venture capital, but by the founders’ credit cards, meaning it didn’t have impatient investors to answer to. “I don’t think their success is replicable,” says Tomasz Tunguz, a partner at Redpoint Ventures.Tesla to raise $1.4 billion with public offering to fund Model 3 production:Tesla will raise at least $1.4 billion through a secondary stock offering, the company announced in SEC filings today, and an additional 5.5 million shares will be purchased by CEO Elon Musk via a stock option exercise. The funds will be used to \"accelerate the production ramp of Model 3,\" according to the filing, with Tesla moving its 500,000 vehicle per year build plan to 2018 from 2020. Musk will exercise all his outstanding stock options for a total of 5,503,972 shares, with 2,777,901 of those being offered for sale to cover his tax burden. Tesla will not receive any of the proceeds from that sale, and Musk's net holdings in Tesla will increase. The Tesla Model 3 was unveiled in March and is the first \"affordable\" Tesla car, priced at around $35,000. Tesla says it will go more than 215 miles on a full charge and the success of the Model 3 will determine the future of the company. The first deliveries of the car are expected in late 2017, with volume production beginning in 2018. Initial demand for the car appears to be very strong, with the company reporting that it had taken roughly 400,000 preorders with refundable $1,000 deposits as of late April. In the filing Tesla revealed that as of May 15th, it currently had 373,000 preorders after 8,000 customer cancellations and 4,200 duplicate orders were cancelled by the company. Tesla is no stranger to secondary offerings. It raised around $500 million in a smaller offering last year.LinkedIn Says Hackers Are Trying to Sell Fruits of Huge 2012 Data Breach:  LinkedIn said on Wednesday that hackers were attempting to sell what they claimed were 117 million email addresses and passwords of its users, suggesting that a data breach in 2012 was magnitudes bigger than initially thought.LinkedIn is investigating the authenticity of the data, the company said. But a security researcher, Troy Hunt, said on Twitter that he had verified a portion of the breach and that it was “highly likely this is legit.” The hacker is trying to sell the data on an illegal marketplace for five bitcoin, or about $2,200, according to Motherboard. In 2012, the account information of 6.5 million users was posted to a Russian hacker site. LinkedIn settled a class-action lawsuit in 2015, agreeing to compensate 800,000 people who had paid for its premium services. Since the attack, the company has stepped up its security procedures, including enabling two-step verification, a technique security experts recommend for your most sensitive online accounts.China Quietly Targets U.S. Tech Companies in Security Reviews: Chinese authorities are quietly scrutinizing technology products sold in China by Apple and other big foreign companies, focusing on whether they pose potential security threats to the country and its consumers and opening up a new front in an already tense relationship with Washington over digital security. Apple and other companies in recent months have been subjected to reviews that target encryption and the data storage of tech products, said people briefed on the reviews who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the reviews, Chinese officials require executives or employees of the foreign tech companies to answer questions about the products in person, according to these people. The reviews are run by a committee associated with the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s Internet control bureau, they said. The bureau includes experts and engineers with ties to the country’s military and security agencies. While other countries, including the United States and Britain, conduct reviews of some tech products, they usually focus on products that will be used by the military or other parts of the government that are concerned with security, and not on products sold to the general public. The Chinese reviews stand out because they are being applied more broadly, including to American consumer software and gadgets popular in China, the people briefed on the reviews said. And because Chinese officials have not disclosed the nature of the checks, both the United States government and American tech companies fear that the reviews could be used to extract tech knowledge as well as ensure that the United States was not using the products to spy. Ultimately, the reviews could be used to block products without explanation or to extract trade secrets in exchange for market access. Those secrets could be leaked to Chinese competitors or expose vulnerabilities, which, in turn, Chinese hackers could exploit. Further, tech companies are concerned that the reviews could set a precedent and that other countries will follow suit, each demanding different checks that would not only be costly but also put the companies at risk of having to hand over further secrets in exchange for market access.Google's launch of a carpooling service Monday marks the beginning of its seemingly inevitable entry into the ridesharing wars. The pilot program, which is being offered via Google's Waze navigation app, aims to connect commuters who need a ride with drivers who can supply one. In exchange, riders will help cover the drivers' fuel costs. Consolidating rides means fewer cars on the road — which is better for traffic congestion and the environment, according to Waze.

It’s probably no surprise then that Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is making his first trip to the country. Cook, who begins his multiday visit on Wednesday, will unveil a development center for digital maps in Hyderabad and introduce an accelerator program for iOS developers in Bangalore, a person with knowledge of the trip said. Apple is pushing to open its first retail stores in the country, though it’s not clear whether any discussions will be part of the CEO’s agenda on this trip. The prize is more than 1 billion in smartphone sales in the next five years, according to researcher Counterpoint. As China’s market becomes more saturated and people across the globe upgrade their smartphones less frequently, Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and other vendors are keen to sell to India’s middle class, which is projected to quadruple to 200 million by 2020. Signs of this explosive rise in consumption already emerged in the first three months of this year, when Apple reported that shipments in India grew 56 percent, even as iPhone sales declined globally for the first time ever.Can virtual reality translate into real profits? A growing number of U.S. companies are counting on virtual reality for real profits. With growth hard to come by amid the lethargic economy, companies ranging from snowmobile manufacturers to furniture sellers are incorporating virtual reality that so far has mostly been found in video games. Their bet: that the trendy headset-based technology can help them build sales and cut costs. Theme park operator Six Flags Entertainment Corp (SIX.N) is outfitting riders on some of its aging roller coasters with Samsung VR headsets, allowing the company to brand the rides as brand-new without having to build costly new attractions. nowmobile manufacturer Arctic Cat Inc (ACAT.O) has developed virtual reality rides that customers can use to try out new models at dealerships, while eBay Inc's (EBAY.O) StubHub is testing technology that allows fans to check out the view from different seats before buying tickets. In the most recent round of corporate earnings reports, some 38 companies - including the New York Times, GoPro, and furniture-seller Wayfair - highlighted virtual reality as a part of their business plans. That was a 375 percent jump from the 8 that did so at this time last year, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings calls transcripts. Nearly all were either consumer or technology companies, suggesting that virtual reality technology has a ways to go before becoming mainstream. Yet for all of the enthusiasm, there is little evidence that virtual reality can deliver substantial growth. here are few pure plays for investors who want to buy into virtual reality. Facebook Inc (FB.O), which paid $2 billion for its Oculus virtual reality division in 2014 and began shipping its first $599 Oculus Rift headsets in March, has the best-known virtual reality head gear, though other well-known companies including Google's parent Alphabet and Apple are rumored to be working on high-powered headsets of their own. Neither company returned requests to comment. Virtual reality is such a small part of Facebook's business that most analysts do not break out Oculus in their revenue or earnings estimates. Nor did Facebook give any numbers on how many Oculus headsets it expects to sell on its most recent earnings call. \"This is very early and we don't expect VR to take off as a mainstream success right away ... but eventually we believe that VR is going to be the next big computing platform and we're making the investments necessary to lead the way there,\" Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said.For online lenders, it’s suddenly touch-and-go:  A year ago, privately held online lenders like Prosper, SoFiand Avant looked all but certain to go public at the same unicorn valuations their venture investors had assigned them — if not higher. They were seemingly reshaping the student, consumer and small business lending business. The market they’re chasing is enormous: The U.S. consumer lending market is a $3.5 trillion business, and 22 of  the largest online marketplace platforms originated just more than $5 billion of unsecured consumer credit in 2014 and more than $10 billion in 2015. They also talked a big game. When SoFi raised a whopping $1 billion from Softbank last year, CEO Michael Cagney told Bloomberg: “I’m looking at over $1 trillion of market cap from the banks, and I think it’s all vulnerable.” Fast forward to today, and it’s online lenders that suddenly look like sitting ducks. In an SEC filing yesterday, Lending Club, which announced the surprise departure of its founder and CEO last Monday, revealed that investors who “contributed a significant amount of funding” for loans are now examining that performance “or are otherwise reluctant to invest.” For many casual observers in Silicon Valley, the first signs of trouble in the online lending category emerged in late April, when the WSJ reported that Avant made $514 million worth of new loans in the U.S. in the first quarter, a 27 percent drop from the fourth quarter of 2015. Then, two weeks ago, Prosper confirmed that it planned to cut roughly 28 percent of its staff in response to falling loan volume. And Prosper’s news came just a day after OnDeck Capital said its own first-quarter losses had more than doubled as demand for its loans began to nosedive. Of course, the kicker came last week, when Lending Club CEO Renaud LaPlanche resigned following an internal audit that turned up $22 million in loans that were sold to Jefferies yet didn’t meet the investment bank’s criteria. Smartly, some players are already looking to reimagine themselves as broader financial outfits. For example, SoFi, which began as a way for students from top universities to refinance their debt, has since branched into personal loans, wealth management and mortgages. It also said last month that it’s hoping to drum up more investor demand for the debt it originates by starting a hedge fund that will buy its own loans. Baker expects that to survive and thrive, more online lenders may need to remodel themselves into the institutions they vowed to replace, either by becoming banks, buying or selling to banks or else striking up partnerships with banks. OnDeck and JPMorgan made one such pact. Last month, JPMorgan quietly began offering online loans to its existing small-business customers using OnDeck’s technology. Indeed, there is a silver lining, and it’s that huge market opportunity. The trick for online lenders will be finding new ways to pursue it while remaining viable businesses.Why a staggering number of Americans have stopped using the Internet the way they used to: Nearly one in two Internet users say privacy and security concerns have now stopped them from doing basic things online — such as posting to social networks, expressing opinions in forums or even buying things from websites, according to a new government survey released Friday. This chilling effect, pulled out of a survey of 41,000 U.S. households who use the Internet, show the insecurity of the Web is beginning to have consequences that stretch beyond the direct fall-out of an individual losing personal data in breach. The research suggests some consumers are reaching a tipping point where they feel they can no longer trust using the Internet for everyday activities. The survey showed that nearly 20 percent of the survey's respondents had personally experienced some form of identity theft, an online security breach, or another similar problem over the year before the survey was taken last July. Overall, 45 percent said their concerns about online privacy and security stopped them from using the Web in very practical ways. The NTIA survey also showed that the more connected devices people owned, the more they experienced a breach of data. For those with only one laptop or computer or smartphone, 9 percent reported a security incident. That number more than tripled for those with at least five devices.Uber China Rival Didi to Consider U.S. IPO as Soon as 2017: Apple may not need to wait that long before it reaps the benefits of investing $1 billion in Chinese car-hailing service Didi Chuxing. Didi is targeting an initial public offering in New York next year, according to people familiar with the matter. The timing will depend on how its battle with Uber Technologies Inc. in China plays out, said the people, who requested not to be named because the matter is private. Such a move may put the Chinese app ahead of its U.S. rival in going public, with Uber having said it wants to hold off as long as possible. China’s biggest ride-hailing app is in the process of raising about $3 billion of funding, including Apple’s $1 billion contribution, which has swelled the company’s valuation to about $26 billion, people familiar have said. Didi, already backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., has reached break even in about half of the 400 Chinese cities it operates in as Uber spends heavily to win both drivers and riders. At Didi’s current valuation, a U.S. IPO could be the biggest by a Chinese company since Alibaba’s record offering in 2014. The company is among a list of ride-sharing apps including Uber and Lyft Inc. that could conduct a public offering. Didi hasn’t decided on which exchange and which banks to hire yet, the people said. Didi was created last year when separate apps backed by Tencent and Alibaba merged after brutal competition drove up losses. The company now has 14 million registered drivers in China, delivering more than 11 million rides a day, and last month said it’s on track to turn an operating profit “soon.”Exclusive: Warren Buffett, Quicken Loans founder in Yahoo bid - sources: Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett is backing a consortium vying for Yahoo Inc's internet assets that includes Quicken Loans Inc founder Dan Gilbert, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. While there is no certainty that the consortium will prevail in the auction, the interest of Buffett and Gilbert is a boost for the Sunnyvale, California-based company, which has been surpassed in recent years by rivals such as Alphabet Inc in the race for internet users and advertising dollars. The consortium's participation in the sale process also represents a challenge to U.S. telecommunications carrier Verizon Communications Inc, whose deal to acquire AOL last year for $4.4 billion has made it a favorite to prevail in its bid for Yahoo's assets among industry analysts.Intel Sells $2.75 Billion of Bonds to Refinance 2016 Debt: Intel Corp. sold $2.75 billion of bonds on Thursday to refinance debt due this year and a portion of notes maturing in 2017. The world’s biggest chipmaker issued debt three parts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The longest portion was $1.25 billion of 30-year notes yielding 1.55 percentage points above comparable government debt. That’s down from an initial offer of 1.7 percentage points, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the sale.S&P Global Ratings gave the bonds an A+ grade, according to a statement on Thursday. Intel is the latest U.S. blue-chip company to offer notes in what’s poised to be second-busiest week for issuance this year. In its last multibillion-dollar deal, Intel sold $7 billion of bonds in July to finance part of its $16.7 billion takeover of Altera Corp. The company plans to repay its $1.5 billion of 1.95 percent notes due in October and a portion of the $3 billion of 1.35 percent bonds due next year. Investment-grade companies have sold more than $49 billion worth of bonds so far this week as they take advantage of low borrowing costs after posting earnings for the quarter ended March 31. Companies are also front-loading issuance before the summer slowdown, according to Ben Emons, a money manager at Leader Capital Corp. in Los Angeles.Apple invests $1 billion in Chinese Uber rival ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing: Apple said on Thursday it has invested $1 billion in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, a move that Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said would help the company better understand the critical Chinese market. The investment comes as Apple is trying to reinvigorate sales in China, its second-largest market. Apple recently has come under pressure from Chinese regulators, with its online book and film services shut down last month, and Cook is traveling to the country this month. The investment gives Apple, which has hired dozens of automotive experts over the past year, a sizeable stake in Uber Technologies Inc's chief rival in China. Cook said in an interview that he sees opportunities for Apple and Didi Chuxing to collaborate in the future.What happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant: To help with his class this spring, a Georgia Tech professor hired Jill Watson, a teaching assistant unlike any other in the world. Throughout the semester, she answered questions online for students, relieving the professor’s overworked teaching staff. But, in fact, Jill Watson was an artificial intelligence bot. Ashok Goel, a computer science professor, did not reveal Watson’s true identity to students until after they’d turned in their final exams. Students were amazed. “I feel like I am part of history because of Jill and this class!” wrote one in the class’s online forum. “Just when I wanted to nominate Jill Watson as an outstanding TA in the CIOS survey!” said another. Now Goel is forming a business to bring the chatbot to the wider world of education. While he doesn’t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot’s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don’t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes. At the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM. Goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course’s online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions. As Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit. To train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the class’s previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered. Goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jill’s answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as “Where can I find assignment two?” and “When is assignment two due?” Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough. The system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate. There are many questions Jill can’t handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants. Goel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn’t human.Three More Signs Smartphone Downturn Is Going From Bad to Worse: Three suppliers that seldom command much attention, working behind the scenes to make devices sold under the brands of better-known customers, put out back-to-back earnings reports Tuesday. They spell trouble ahead for smartphone makers and other companies that once thrived on mobile mania. Pegatron Corp., which assembles iPhones, missed profit expectations and said April sales dived 16 percent. Minebea Co., which makes LED lights for mobiles, lagged its own forecasts for revenue and earnings. Japan Display Inc., which supplies screens to Apple and others, said profit has deteriorated so rapidly it will lose money for the fiscal year and suspend a promised dividend. Adding to the gloom, Lenovo Group Ltd. tumbled to a four-year low as analysts warned of rising competition. Pegatron and its peers are merely the latest in a string of ill omens for a market facing its worst pace of expansion since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. Much of the gloom centers on China, the phenomenal growth engine that’s now headed for an epicshakeout. Smartphones are no longer a novelty and most domestic brands target the mid- and low-price ranges, where buyers don’t upgrade as frequently as those for high-end Apple and Samsung phones.As Lending Club Stumbles, Its Entire Industry Faces Skepticism: Renaud Laplanche and his crew steered a 105-foot racing boat through New York Harbor one day last spring, its towering sails ripping across the water at 30 knots. An accomplished sailor and founder of Lending Club, Mr. Laplanche was hosting executives from hedge funds, Goldman Sachs and other banks — part of his effort to win over Wall Street on his plans to upend traditional banking with a faster, more democratic form of lending. He already had endorsements from Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary, and John Mack, the former chief of Morgan Stanley, who joined his board. At Lending Club’s initial public offering in December 2014, the company was valued at over $8 billion. But on Monday, Lending Club announced that Mr. Laplanche had resigned after an internal investigation found improprieties in its lending process, including the altering of millions of dollars’ worth of loans. The company’s stock price, already reeling in recent months, fell 34 percent. The company’s woes are part of a broader reckoning in the online money-lending industry. Last week, Prosper, another online lender that focuses on consumers, laid off more than a quarter of its work force, and the chief executive said he was forgoing his salary for the year. Marketplace lenders like Lending Club have created easy-to-use websites that match consumers and small businesses, hoping to borrow a few thousand dollars, with individuals or Wall Street investors looking to lend money. Freed from the costs of brick-and-mortar branches and federal regulations requiring that they reserve money against their loans, marketplace lenders have been able to grow quickly and with fewer expenses. The process is almost entirely online, with loans approved in days rather than the weeks a traditional bank might take. While marketplace loans account for less than 1 percent of the consumer loans in the United States, a recent report by the investment bank Jefferies said that in some segments — like installment loans — the new lending companies account for more than 10 percent of the market. But in the first quarter, lenders like Lending Club, Prosper and OnDeck Capital had difficulty convincing investors that their business models are sound. Wall Street’s waning demand for loans exposed the Achilles’ heel of marketplace lending. Unlike traditional banks that use their deposits to fund loans, the marketplace companies discovered how fleeting their funding sources can be.Researchers say computer screens change how you think about what you read: You probably spend a lot of time staring at screens -- but all that computer time may be making you miss the big picture, new research has found. Reading something on a screen -- as opposed to a printout -- causes people to home in on details and but not broader ideas, according to a new article by Geoff Kaufman. a professor at Carnegie Mellon, and Mary Flanagan, a professor at Dartmouth.  \"Digital screens almost seem to create a sort of tunnel vision where you're focusing on just the information you're getting this moment, not the broader context,\" Kaufman said. The article is based on a series of studies involving a total of more than 300 participants that were carried out while the two researchers worked together at Tiltfactor, a Dartmouth game design lab. The studies covered in the latest article were prompted by earlier research from Kaufman and Flanagan that found players using the iPad version of a disease prevention strategy game struggled with long-term strategy much more than those playing a physical copy of the game.Zenefits Was the Perfect Startup. Then It Self-Disrupted: Zenefits makes online software that automates health insurance, payroll, and other essential office drudgery—kind of a human resources version of TurboTax. It’s not a sexy idea, but with 6 million small businesses in the U.S., it’s enormously useful. The company was founded in 2013 by Parker Conrad, who realized he could streamline small businesses’ managerial needs, saving them hundreds of hours of mind-numbing paperwork—not to mention the cost of staffing an HR department—by putting everything online. Conrad was known to be a little frenzied and disorganized but fiercely intelligent. “From an investment philosophy … we look for the magnitude of the genius, as opposed to the lack of issues,” says Andreessen’s founding partner Ben Horowitz. “And in a way, [Conrad] was like the prototype.” Conrad had no background in health insurance but quickly learned the intricacies of the business as well as any veteran. “If you’re an insurance broker,” he said at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in 2013, “we’re going to drink your milkshake.”  Then In California, they found, some of the sales team used Conrad’s macro to systematically cheat on the state’s training course, which included a section on ethics. “As far as a company doing what Zenefits has done, I don’t know that we have seen this before,” says Nancy Kincaid, press secretary for the California Department of Insurance, which has also opened an investigation. In March, Massachusetts’ division of insurance opened a third. Zenefits confirms that other states have since followed but won’t say which ones or even how many. Sacks became CEO and is guiding Zenefits through its crisis cleanup. He has banned alcohol at the office and changed the company motto from “Ready. Fire. Aim.” to “Operate With Integrity.” In February the company laid off 250 employees, including the enterprise team. Sales Vice President Blond, Semaan’s boss, and any executive or manager known to have helped disseminate the macro are also gone. Zenefits says it has self-reported the findings of its internal investigation to all 50 states and is working with those that have opened formal inquiries. Fidelity Investments, which owns a stake, has slashed its valuation of Zenefits from $4.5 billion to less than $2 billion. There are rows of empty desks at the San Francisco office; the company plans to downsize from four floors to three. The Star Wars-themed conference rooms will soon be renamed after inspirational entrepreneurs. Kegs have been replaced with cold-brew coffee. The stairwells are condom-free. Zenefits might also survive for the one reason that made its product so appealing to business owners in the first place: Shopping for health insurance remains really frustrating. The company says it now has 20,000 accounts. “As long as their problems don’t affect our company, we’ll stay,” says Todd Harmond, vice president for finance and operations of the e-book service Scribd, which uses Zenefits to offer Kaiser Permanente and Anthem health insurance plans to its 85 employees. “Unless something else goes really wrong with Zenefits, we’ll stick with them for a while,” says BlogMutt’s Yates. “It’s too much of a hassle to switch.”Companies are betting on a new way to protect your identity: the selfie: The selfie is about to get serious. Already ubiquitous at parties and for capturing Instagram-worthy landscapes, the act of raising a phone to your face and finding the perfect photo angle could take on a whole new role in people’s finances. Some banks, tax agencies and tech companies are making the selfie an integral step for people checking their bank accounts, shopping online and filing tax returns. Forced to find creative ways to guard against the rising threat of identity theft, a growing number of companies are moving from a system that tests people on what they know, such as a password. Now they want to ask consumers to provide evidence of something that can’t easily be changed or copied: their face.  A photo also can serve as a way for consumers to offer proof that it was indeed them — and not an imposter —  who made that purchase or submitted that form. For instance, MasterCard plans to roll out a service nicknamed “Selfie Pay” this summer through its member banks. Through the program, consumers would shop online as usual and after checking out, they would confirm the purchase by taking a selfie with a MasterCard mobile app. And Georgia will roll out a pilot program for the next tax season at the end of the year that gives taxpayers the option of creating a secure account where they verify their identities by taking a photo. If there is a match, taxpayers will be asked take a photo on their smartphones before their tax returns can be processed, ensuring the return was not submitted by a fraudster. To overcome that risk, the companies are requiring selfies that are a little different than the ones you might see on Facebook. After finding the right angle, consumers are asked to move around to confirm that the camera is capturing a live person and not a photo. In the MasterCard and USAA programs, users are told when to blink. Georgia’s tax program will prompt people to position their faces a certain way and scan for motion.  AlexaSite wins the Disrupt NY 2016 Hackathon Grand Prize: AlexaSite lets designers update websites using their voice.

Neat!Palantir Struggles to Retain Clients and Staff, BuzzFeed Reports: Palantir Technologies Inc., one of Silicon Valley’s most highly valued private companies, has struggled to retain employees and prominent customers, according to areport by BuzzFeed. In 2015, Palantir generated $420 million in revenue, BuzzFeed reported, citing interviews with former and current employees, as well as more than 1,000 internal e-mails and documents. The secretive big data company spent more than $500 million last year, the report said. A spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Palantir’s bookings, which refer to the value of contracts that typically span many years, exceeded $1 billion in 2014 and continued growing in 2015, a person with knowledge of the matter said last year. BuzzFeed reported Palantir bookings of $1.7 billion in 2015. American Express Co., Coca-Cola Co. and Nasdaq Inc. were among the companies that walked away from contracts with Palantir over the last year or so, BuzzFeed reported. Hershey Co. is reevaluating its relationship with Palantir, and Kimberly-Clark Corp. considered becoming a customer before deciding that Palantir’s high prices were unjustified, the report said. Palantir also counts Axa SA, Bridgewater Associates LP, Credit Suisse Group AG and First Data Corp. among its clients. Its biggest customer is BP Plc, which signed an agreement with Palantir in November 2014 worth $1.2 billion over 10 years, plus bonus payments as determined by executives from both companies, according to BuzzFeed. Employee defections accelerated early this year, and at the current pace, the attrition rate this year would be 20 percent, BuzzFeed reported. The departure rate in 2015 was 14 percent and 12 percent in 2014, the report said.Reliance on China health sector raises searching questions for Baidu: The death of a student following experimental cancer treatment he found through China's biggest search engine, Baidu Inc, has exposed the faultlines in the company's business model, which relies heavily on income from the country's lightly regulated health sector. Before his death, student Wei Zexi, 21, criticized the military-run hospital that provided the failed treatment for misleading claims about its effectiveness and accused Baidu, which controls 80 percent of the Chinese search market, of promoting false medical information. Baidu has come in for fierce online criticism for how it handles adverts within its search results, especially from an industry as sensitive as healthcare, which analysts at Nomura and Daiwa say provides 20 to 30 percent of its search revenues. In 2015 search revenues were 55.7 billion yuan ($8.6 billion), or 84 percent of Baidu's total sales. \"Whatever page you're looking at on Baidu is a mess of adverts,\" said username FreedLiu on China's Weibo microblog, discussing Wei. \"They're profiting from loads of people who don't know Baidu auctions (its search results).\" Baidu said it applied particular vigilance to healthcare customers, with screening for misleading adverts and a verification program with additional scrutiny for medical advertisers. Criticism in several state media outlets this week suggests a hardening attitude in government. \"Pursuing profits is not wrong, but putting profits over helpless patients' lives is against any ethical standards,\" said a column in the official People's Daily on Monday. Any decision by authorities to restrict healthcare advertising could have a material impact on Baidu's earnings, a concern that has contributed to a sharp fall in its shares in the last three sessions. Daiwa said 10-15 percent of Baidu's search revenue could evaporate under a worst-case scenario.Like most search engines, Baidu places paid-for ads in its search results, but in a series of Reuters search tests it included at least twice as many ads as Alphabet Inc's Google, which is blocked in China, and placed them higher in its list. Though Baidu marks such items as promotions, Google also highlights the word \"Ad\" in a yellow box.Apple's Tim Cook to visit China for government meetings - source: Tim Cook plans to visit Beijing later this month to meet high-level government officials, at a time when it is facing some setbacks in its most important overseas market, a source familiar with the matter said. Cook has frequently traveled to China since taking the helm of Apple five years ago, but his latest visit comes during a critical period. From weakening smartphone sales to the loss of an iPhone trademark dispute and the suspension of some of its online entertainment services, the U.S. technology giant has been facing a flurry of problems in recent weeks in its second-largest market after the United States. That has raised concerns over Apple's growth momentum, as the company reported last week its first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years. Last week, billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn said in an interview with cable television network CNBC that he had sold his entire stake in Apple, citing China's economic slowdown and worries about whether the government could make it very difficult for Apple to conduct business.During his China visit, Cook plans to meet senior government and Communist Party leaders - including officials in charge of propaganda, said the source, who declined to be named as the plan is not public yet.What 25 hours in virtual reality feels like: A Los Angeles writer set a world record after spending 25 hours playing a single game in virtual reality. Derek Westerman, 32, took on the challenge after trying virtual reality for the first time earlier this year. Westerman was left wondering how long anyone could last in an experience that he considered intense and overwhelming. When Westerman found out there was no world record for time spent in a virtual reality headset, Westerman pitched the stunt to Super Deluxe, a maker of comedic YouTube videos. For the challenge Westerman spent the 25 hours making three-dimensional artwork in a game called Tilt Brush. Each hour Westerman would start a new painting, and shift between standing, sitting down or lying on the floor. Westerman, who ultimately said it was a great experience, hasn’t worn a virtual reality headset since setting the world record a month ago. For 24 hours after the experience Westerman said that everything looked uncanny. Spending a day in virtual reality changed how his brain registered space. Objects in the distance looked odd, as if they weren’t real. Human senses are capable of adapting well to new and different circumstances, according to University of Maryland professor Amitabh Varshney, who leads its virtual reality research efforts. Varshney recalled an experiment in which an Australian professor outfitted his assistant with glasses that inverted his vision, turning the world upside down. While initially confused, before long he was able to perform everyday tasks such as ride a bicycle.SAP announces new partnership with Apple to expand iOS in the enterprise:  SAP announced a broad partnership with Apple today to bring iOS to SAP’s enterprise customer base. The announcement comes almost two years after Apple made a similar deal with IBM. Steve Lucas, president for SAP’s Digital Enterprise Platform says while it’s natural to see similarities between the two deals — two large enterprise companies making a deal with Apple — he says there are major differences. For starters, he says SAP is firmly an enterprise software company and it has built a cloud platform to access all of the software it has developed, whether its core ERP product, SuccessFactors or Concur. He says having that core certainly is a differentiating factor in his view. Still there are similarities too. As with IBM, SAP has been working closely with Apple to bring its profound design sense to this endeavor. The objective of this partnership is no less than to revolutionize work on the iPad and iPhone, Lucas says. It’s no secret that Apple wants a bigger piece of the enterprise market and these kinds of agreements help solidify their enterprise position and drive Apple hardware sales inside companies that were traditionally PC shops — and hence more often considered Microsoft territory. Finally, much like IBM it wouldn’t be a deal without an educational component to round it out, so SAP is also offering SAP Academy for iOS as a training ground for SAP programmers to learn to use the HANA iOS SDK. Lucas says the company is absolutely committed to this educational effort and it’s not something they will announce and go away in a few months, but a program that he sees lasting well into the future. While you might not see a natural fit between SAP and Apple, when the IBM partnership was launched in 2014, it certainly raised some eyebrows too, but by the end of last year the partnership had created 100 apps — and that number has surely increased since then. In fact, SAP is also planning on building 100 apps. The apps and the SDK are not yet available, but they say they should start to trickle out in Beta later this year. Many of the apps are in progress, according to Lucas, but they are not ready to ship yet. Apple also signed a partnership with Cisco last summer.Tesla Falls on Cash Concerns, Doubt About Manufacturing Goals: Tesla Motors Inc. fell Thursday after the company, aiming to dramatically boost production, withdrew its projection to generate more cash than it uses this year and said it will probably need to raise capital. Shares in the electric-car maker fell 4.9 percent to $211.71 at 1:28 p.m. New York time. The shares had surged late Wednesday and early Thursday after Tesla moved ahead by two years its target date for reaching annual production of 500,000 vehicles before sinking on skepticism about the ambitious assembly goals and concerns about cash. Tesla said in a letter to shareholders Wednesday that to meet the new production target, capital expenditures this year will probably be about $750 million more than the $1.5 billion originally planned. A capital raise of about $2 billion would dilute current owners by about 7 percent, UBS analyst Colin Langan wrote in a note.Netflix reveals what images hook viewers on new shows: Netflix has found that its viewers spend only 1.8 seconds considering whether to watch a show or movie that is presented to them. With so little time to make a successful pitch to potential viewers, the company has become obsessed with making it easy for members to make a quick decision about whether a show is interesting. For Netflix that means perfecting the promotional artwork — imagery that runs alongside an explanation of the show. Members spend 82 percent of their time focusing on artwork while browsing Netflix, according to the company. This week Netflix released new findings about the power of the images its presents to viewers while introducing them to shows, and what traits in an image can encourage a viewer to watch a show. Netflix finds that images with expressive facial emotion that convey the tone of the show do well. Artwork featuring recognizable or polarizing characters also succeed. Even if a show has an ensemble cast, when it comes to promotional purposes — someone needs to hog the spotlight. “While ensemble casts are fantastic for a huge billboard on the side of a highway, they are too complex at small sizes and ultimately not as effective at helping our members decide if the title is right for them on smaller screens,” explained Netflix’s Nick Nelson in the blog post. While the Netflix show “Orange Is the New Black” featured eight cast members in its Season 1 image, Netflix scaled back to a single character for seasons 2 and 3. Netflix reached these conclusions through what’s called A/B testing, in which audiences are split into groups and shown different images. Analysts then gauge how audiences respond to the different options.India rejects Apple's plan to import used iPhones: India has rejected a plan by Apple Inc to import used iPhones, government officials said on Wednesday, a blow to the U.S. tech giant that has been seeking to revive waning sales of its flagship smartphones. Apple sells what it calls refurbished iPhones at a discount in some countries, including the United States. Extending this practice to India would have likely helped it increase its share in one of the world's fastest growing smartphone markets against competitors with much cheaper offerings. But India, which is pushing a 'Make in India' initiative to boost the competitiveness of its manufacturing sector, rejected the proposal citing rules against importing used electronics. Apple's proposal was opposed by domestic phone makers who claim selling refurbished iPhones - devices that have been returned by buyers or repaired to factory condition after damage - would breach India's anti-dumping rules. The Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association had written to India's telecom ministry to stall the move. The news comes at a time when Apple posted its first-ever drop in iPhone sales amid weakness in China, its most important market after the United States. In India, Apple only has about a 2 percent market share but its sales there surged 56 percent in the first three months, driven mainly by cheaper older-generation devices such as the iPhone 5S while demand for the new iPhone SE disappointed. \"The 5S' success in India has more to do with affordability of a premium brand than a preference for smaller phones, and the move to the more expensive SE will discourage budget buyers,\" said Wilmer Ang, an analyst at research firm Canalys. The newly launched iPhone SE retails at 39,000 rupees ($585) in India - almost $200 higher than its U.S. price. To successfully tap into India's smartphone boom - where sales are expected to grow 25 percent this year - Apple will need a better retail presence and cheaper versions of the iPhone given the average smartphone in the country sells for less than$150, according to analysts. Apple, which currently retails in India through local partners, is already seeking government approval to set up its first store in the country.Tesla's Wild New Forecast Would Change the Trajectory of an Entire Industry - If Met: Tesla just took the most ambitious automotive production timeline since the Ford Model T and moved it up two years. The company now plans to produce 500,000 electric cars every year starting in 2018. That's 10 times the number of vehicles it produced in 2015, and enough to ensure that all 400,000 customers who put down a $1,000 deposit on the forthcoming Model 3 will qualify for a significant U.S. subsidy. Talk about doubling down—even the original 2020 goal was considered a long shot by Wall Street. This new target would pledge the carmaker to a faster production growth rate than Ford Motor Co. managed in the early 1900s. That's when Henry Ford pioneered the production line with the Model T, the first mass-market combustion-driven car. A century later, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk wants the Model 3 to be its electric grandchild. He's now aiming for close to a million sales by 2020.  BNEF tracked 234,000 electric car sales worldwide last year, of which Tesla made up a fifth of the market, Morsy said. For Tesla to stay on its new track, it would need to produce more cars next year than the entire global electric-car industry made in 2015. Tesla's first mass-produced car, the $35,000 Model 3, will need to come to market on schedule, and with great momentum, in late 2017. Telsa's battery factory in Nevada must flourish, costs must come down, and car-making capacity must scale up at an astonishing rate. For context: Tesla has never managed to hit one of Musk's timelines for a new product launch. Not once. Flipkart valuation marked down by two more investors: Two small mutual fund investors at Flipkart have marked down the company’s valuation, joining other investors who believe that India’s largest e-commerce firm is overvalued. Valic Co 1 marked down Flipkart’s value by 29.4% as of February, compared with August 2015, according to a regulatory filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Valic valued Flipkart’s Series D stock at $98 a share in February, down from $139 a share in August.Fidelity Rutland Square Trust II marked down Flipkart’s value by as much as 39.6% as of February, compared with last August, according to a filing with the SEC. Fidelity valued Flipkart’s Series D stock at $82 a share in February, down from $135.8 a share in August. The Economic Times reported about the markdowns earlier on Wednesday. To be sure, Fidelity and Valic hold very small amounts of Flipkart stock. Their holdings together are worth less than $6 million. That’s a minuscule fraction of Flipkart’s overall value. The company last raised $700 million from investors in July last year at a valuation $15 billion. But taken along with other markdowns by Morgan Stanley and T Rowe Price, both of which together own hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Flipkart stock, it confirms the view that Flipkart’s own investors believe the company is overvalued by a significant amount. In late February, Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust, another mutual fund investor in Flipkart, slashed the value of its holdings by as much as 27%. Then, last month, T Rowe Price disclosed in a filing that it cut the value of its stake in Flipkart by 15%.Free Code Camp survey reveals demographics of self-taught coders: If you’ve ever wondered who exactly is signing up for all these free learn-at-home coding classes and tutorial websites, Free Code Camp (which is one of them) has kindly surveyed 15,624 users with regard to various basic demographics and some more code-centric items. Some of the stats are expected (few women — around 1 in 5 surveyed) and a few are surprising — for instance, only 18 percent said they’d like to work for a startup. Thirty-eight percent don’t plan on specializing in UX, backend stuff or other specific disciplines, which they might want to revisit later. And they’re all over the world — mostly the U.S., with India a close second — but the long tail comprises 167 more countries.Uber enables global e-hailing through Alipay to fend against Lyft/Didi alliance: Starting today, Uber riders from China won’t have to worry about language barriers or currency when traveling outside of the country. Now, riders will be able to pay for and hail a ride in the Alipay app in the more than 400 cities in which Uber operates. It’s an extension of Uber’s existing partnership with the company, which initially only allowed passengers in China to pay for their rides using Alipay. The move comes just a few weeks after Lyft and China’s Didi launched a similar integration that allows Didi riders to hail a Lyft in the U.S. using the Didi Chuxing (formerly Didi Kuaidi) app, and vice versa. That partnership is part of a larger global ride-hail alliance that also includes South East Asia’s Grab and India’s Ola. The clear winner in this entire situation is Alipay’s affiliate company, Alibaba. That’s because the Chinese e-commerce company is playing both sides of the fence — Alibaba is an investor in both Didi and Lyft, and Ant Financial, which operates Alipay, has had this partnership with Uber since 2014. It’s certainly true that Alibaba has a higher stake in Lyft and Didi beating out Uber, but the transportation industry isn’t a zero-sum game. Since there’s room for both sides to coexist, Alibaba can afford to put bets on Didi and Lyft, and Uber too. But Alipay may be playing favorites. According to company SVP of business Emil Michael, Uber will be the primary featured transportation app on Alipay’s platform outside of the U.S. Alipay is essentially promoting Uber to its 450 million users.Google, Fiat Chrysler to partner on self-driving minivans: Alphabet Inc's Google unit and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have agreed to work together to build a fleet of 100 self-driving minivans in the most advanced collaboration to date between Silicon Valley and a traditional carmaker, the companies said Tuesday. The deal marks the first time that Google has worked directly with an automaker \"to integrate its self-driving system, including its sensors and software, into a passenger vehicle,\" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. Google and Fiat Chrysler engineers will work together to fit Google's autonomous driving technology into the Pacifica minivan. Some engineers for both companies will work together at a facility in Southeast Michigan, where Fiat Chrysler has its major North American engineering center, the companies said. Google said it is not sharing proprietary self-driving vehicle technology with Fiat Chrysler, however, and the vehicles will not be offered for sale to the public. The agreement between Google and Fiat Chrysler comes as rival technology and auto companies are accelerating efforts to master the complex hardware and artificial intelligence systems required to allow vehicles to pilot themselves.This new apartment is like a college dorm for grown-ups: WeWork, a provider of co-working spaces in 28 cities, isn’t content to just offer you a place to do your job. This week it’s opening WeLive, which offers furnished living quarters and a range of extra amenities in a fresh take on what apartment life should be like. The apartments themselves are on the small side, and many lack a complete kitchen or a full-sized fridge. In some apartments the beds fold into the wall to create more space. But when residents step outside their own walls they have access to common areas including large kitchens stocked with appliances, game rooms, quiet areas and a community garden. WeLive is designed around flexibility — residents live month to month rather than signing a one-year lease. There’s no need to wait for the cable guy to hook up one’s TV or Internet service. And no one has to shop for a bed, couch or table. Residents need to arrive with little more than their clothes. A security deposit is required, but credit checks aren’t done. A private studio in Crystal City starts at $1,640 a month, and a studio with two beds starts at $1,880. There are also one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom apartments. A four-bedroom goes for $4,220 a month. Residents pay a $125 monthly fee that covers utilities, cable and Internet. The New York apartments are more expensive, with private units starting at $2,550. Stephanie Sutton, 31, moved into WeLive’s Crystal City location a month ago. WeLive has brought in some residents early as part of a test period. Sutton said her favorite aspect has been the sense of community. “It really does feel like home,” she said. “It’s a great way to develop friendships without any pressure. Here you passively make 10 friends instantly.”Mid-Career and Itching to Lead a Startup? This VC Firm Wants You: It’s easy to spot the silver hair among Jungle Ventures’ gallery of startup founders. Look closer and you’ll find many have called the shots at banks and Fortune 500 outfits.  That’s no accident. Jungle Ventures’ strategy involves betting on executive-suite veterans over starry-eyed twentysomethings who dream of changing the world, saidAmit Anand, co-founder and managing partner of the Singapore-based firm.  While peers crave youthful upstart vision, Jungle Ventures openly courts corporate bigwigs wondering where to take their careers. Singapore is an Asian base for global banking and technology firms such as Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. -- and that’s its advantage, Anand said. Professionals more accustomed to navigating the corporate jungle than envisioning the next Facebook can become standout entrepreneurs with a little help, he said. And they know how to make a buck. Jungle’s unusual approach seems to have paid off: it’s cashed out of three startups in four years including ZipDial, bought last year by Twitter Inc. Its tactics have won investment from heavy-hitters like Singaporean state investor Temasek Holdings Pte, International Finance Corp. and the wealthy Thakral family. Anand said it’s close to raising a new $100 million fund to add consumer tech and Internet of Things to a portfolio spanning e-commerce, finance and software across Asia.Anand and co-founder Anurag Srivastava were professionals-turned-entrepreneurs themselves before they met through Sony Entertainment Television co-founder Jayesh Parekh and started Jungle in 2012. Over the next four years, the pair witnessed the Singaporean startup scene transform from young university dropouts into an arena dominated by mid-career professionals with serious banking and Internet chops.  They were “leaving their jobs, knowing their industries inside out, wanting to disrupt their own industry. More seasoned, more experienced, going after very large ideas,” Anand said. “That’s something we are going to double down on over the next years, to back more professionals turning into entrepreneurs in disruptive industries, trying to create new industries.”How Foursquare knew before almost anyone how bad things were for Chipotle: Chipotle announced its first loss as a public company Tuesday. But two weeks earlier, an unlikely source —the social media app Foursquare — had beat Chipotle to the punch,predicting in a blog post that the burrito maker’s sales would drop nearly 30 percent. Chipotle made it official Tuesday afternoon — reporting a drop of 29.7 percent.  The remarkably accurate prediction from a company consumers know for restaurant tips and the ability to check in at locations highlights the emerging power of the gobs of data our smartphones collect and the opportunity for savvy companies to convert that information into piles of cash. Foursquare has spent seven years collecting data and has 85 million places in its database. It describes its data trove as the “biggest foot traffic panel in the world.” Clients that buy Foursquare’s data to glean insights include retailers, real estate developers, Wall Street traders and consumer package-goods companies. Foursquare, the seven-year-old start-up, cleverly turned smartphone data into predictions on Chipotle sales that matched Wall Street analysts with far more experience in projecting the successes of businesses such as Chipotle. Last year, Foursquare used its foot-traffic data to predict how many iPhones Apple would sell on a given weekend. Foursquarepredicted sales of 13 million to 15 million. Apple then announced sales of more than 13 million.Once a handful of Foursquare users have checked in at a location, the company knows that a given location represents a certain store. If the smartphones of another Foursquare user move inside these premises — but doesn’t check in — Foursquare still knows the user was in the store. Foursquare relies on GPS data, WiFi, cell towers and beacons to pinpoint where smartphone users are. Data experts caution that there are limits to how far Foursquare can replicate its Chipotle predictions elsewhere. They say Foursquare’s success will work best at large chains. Foursquare needs a lot of data to make such predictions, so it would probably struggle to accurately predict the sales of a retailer that has only a handful of locations.Another limitation to Foursquare’s approach is the nature of a store. Chipotle lends itself to a foot-traffic analysis because customers overwhelmingly travel in person to a store to get their food. It would be more difficult to predict the sales at a business that sells a significant amount of goods online.Gas Delivery Startups Want to Fill Up Your Car Anywhere. Is That Allowed?: A new crop of startups are trying to make gas stations obsolete. Tap an app, and they'll bring the gas to you, filling up your car while you're at work, eating breakfast, or watching Netflix. Filld, WeFuel, Yoshi, Purple and Booster Fuels have started operating in a few cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Palo Alto, Nashville, Tennessee, and Atlanta, Georgia. But officials in some of those cities say that driving around in a pickup truck with hundreds of gallons of gasoline might not be safe. “It is not permitted,” said Lt. Jonathan Baxter, a spokesman for the San Francisco fire department. Baxter said if San Francisco residents see any companies fueling vehicles in the city, they should call the fire department. Yoshi, which operates in San Francisco, was surprised to hear Baxter's concerns. “We haven't talked to them. I don't know about that. It’s news to me,” said co-founder Nick Alexander. The next day, he said he believed Yoshi was following the law and that it had been careful to limit the size of their gas tanks to stay under limits outlined in the International Fire Code, a guideline followed by many U.S. states. Filld, an 18-month-old startup with thousands of customers in Silicon Valley, plans to start service in San Francisco on Monday, deploying three delivery trucks at 1 p.m. “You can never ask for permission because no one will give it,” said Chris Aubuchon, the chief executive officer at Filld. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it’s drafting a policy around gasoline delivery. “Our current fire code does not allow this process; however, we are exploring a wayhis could be allowed with some restrictions,” said Capt. Daniel Curry, a spokesman for the city’s fire department. “It’s just one of these things that nobody has really thought about before—kind of like how Uber popped up out of nowhere.” But he said it’s not a gray area: “All I can tell you at this time is it’s not allowed as per our current fire code.”Icahn: We're out of Apple, and it's China's fault: Billionaire investor Carl Icahn told CNBC on Thursday he has sold hisApple position as the tech giant's stock continues to shed value after disappointing earnings. \"We no longer have a position in Apple,\" Icahn told CNBC's \"Power Lunch,\" noting Apple is a \"great company\" and CEO Tim Cook is \"doing a great job.\" Icahn previously owned a little less than a percent of the tech giant's outstanding shares, which were down more than 3 percent midafternoon Thursday after falling more than 6 percent Wednesday. He said he made roughly $2 billion on Apple, a stock he continued to tout as \"cheap\" despite his reservations.Icahn said China's attitude toward Apple largely drove him to exit his position. \"You worry a little bit — and maybe more than a little — about China's attitude,\" Icahn said, later adding that China's government could \"come in and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there ... you can do pretty much what you want there.\" He added, though, that if China \"was basically steadied,\" he would buy back into Apple.The Apple Watch did not change the Apple Store like we thought it would: It was just over a year ago that the Apple Watch was slated to be unveiled, and the Internet rumor and analysis machine was running in overdrive: Wall Street-types weighed in on whether the new gadget could propel the world’s most valuable company to greater revenue and an even higher stock price. Tech geeks were chattering about the nitty-gritty of its features, and culture mavens debated whether it would become a game changer like the iPod or iPhone before it. And in the retail world, the major question was this: Would the arrival of a product that was not just a gadget, but also a luxury fashion item, push Apple to shake up its successful store format? The root of the speculation, or at least, the primary fuel for it, was a single paragraph in a New Yorker profile of Apple’s design chief, Jonathan Ive. In that story it was reported that Ive and Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail, were working on a redesign of Apple stores, perhaps to make the setting more conducive to selling a luxury timepiece. The story noted that Ive had “overheard someone saying, ‘I’m not going to buy a watch if I can’t stand on carpet.’ ” And so analysts — and reporters, including this one — began wondering: Would certain sections of the store be carpeted? Would they be outfitted with full-length mirrors so people could see how the watch fit into their overall look? Would there be showcase lighting, like at an upscale jeweler? If you’ve set foot in an Apple store lately, you know the answer to all of these questions: No. Apple did end up adding a backroom VIP area to at least one store in New York where customers could try on the Edition, the luxe version of the watch that has a five-figure price tag. But the Apple Store, by and large, still has the same vibe and aesthetic that it did in the pre-Watch era. Sure, some newer stores have fresh features, such as one in Brussels that is outfitted with live trees. An Apple representative has said that a forthcoming store in Memphis is to be a “next-generation” Apple store, with new design elements such as a large TV screen that can display a changing array of products or artwork. But even with those kinds of potential changes, the Apple Store continues to be defined by a spare, contemporary look and feel — and the changes that have been implemented or are on the way don’t exactly seem linked to the unique needs of selling the watch.A Silicon Valley VC says investors from China are joining Series A deals, and they’re playing “hardball”: On valuations: The average thing coming out of Y Combinator is probably a half to three-quarters of what it was [in terms of valuation in recent years]. The average seed-stage deal is half. On hardball tactics: Docs are taking longer because there are new investors coming in, and they want more stuff in their terms. These are newer investors, often foreign investors, who are basically saying: “I want senior preference to [a company’s earlier] investors,” and that’s adding two or three weeks as they usually ask right as the docs are closing. They’re almost all from China, and they want all of their preferences to be senior to everyone else’s. What’s happening is, since they know the capital’s financials, they just wait it out. By that point, we’ve already signed a term sheet and turned off a lot of other people who wanted to invest. These things never come up in the term sheet phase but later in the docs. They’ll say, “We did our diligence, and we need XYZ to invest.” It’s not a great way to start a relationship. People in the ecosystem around here are playing for the long term; they realize that sooner or later, they’ll be on the other side of the table and don’t want this stuff applied to them. This is mostly coming from Asia, where they play much harder hardball than here. And [these investors] do it with a happy face. That’s just the environment [to which they’re accustomed]. On the slowdown in tech valuations:  I don’t expect it to pick up any time soon, which is a function of retail and institutional investors looking for high-growth stories with profit associated with them. They want profit and growth. Meanwhile, a lot of companies that have strong revenue can’t show that growth, and vice versa. There just aren’t a lot of companies that could sustain being public right now.Chinese phone makers Oppo and Vivo pass Xiaomi in global phone sales: Being the “it” smartphone sure doesn’t last long. New data from IDC finds that Xiaomi now trails several of its less well known Chinese rivals when it comes to global market share. Overall, there were 334.9 million smartphones worldwide in the first quarter of 2016, IDC said, up very slightly from the 334.3 million units a year ago. That marks the smallest year-over-year growth on record. Oppo and Vivo, two names unfamiliar to most Americans, are now the No. 4 and No. 5 phone sellers behind Samsung, Apple and Huawei, another big Chinese hardware maker. Huawei is also on the rise, still far short of its goal of supplanting Apple and Samsung, but at least closing the gap on the two leaders. Oppo and Vivo are mostly known in the Chinese market, though Oppo now gets about 20 percent of its sales from outside its home turf.It feels like every tech company is offering cash advances. Shopify is the latest: Following in the footsteps of PayPal and Square, e-commerce software company Shopify said on Wednesday that it would start offering cash advances to business owners who use its software. The program, called Shopify Capital, will let eligible Shopify merchants obtain a lump-sum cash advance in exchange for a fixed percentage of their daily sales. Cash advances are popular with small businesses that don’t have the time or business history to secure a loan from a bank. The Shopify announcement comes more than two years after payments companies PayPal and Square began offering similar programs. Right now, companies that serve small businesses are seeing this market as a way to create a new revenue stream that can be sold to existing customers — and, they hope, help retain them. They are joining an increasingly crowded space, as the online alternative lending space has heated up in recent years. Merchant cash advances have had a mixed reputation in the past, due to hidden fees and the risk of a business getting addicted to them. But internet companies like Shopify are trying to remove the stigma around them by promising to disclose up front how a business will pay back the advance. Square recently moved from offering cash advances to actual loans.Alibaba Financial Affiliate Raises $4.5 Billion: The Alibaba Group of China has become a colossus in the global Internet world, with a market value of nearly $200 billion. Now its online payment affiliate is aiming for  similarly lofty financial goal: becoming one of the most valuable privately held technology companies in the world. The affiliate, known as the Ant Financial Services Group, said on Tuesday that it had raised $4.5 billion from investors. The private financing round suggests that the company is now valued at about $60 billion — or more than $10 billion over the market value of PayPal Holdings, its closest analogue. Ant Financial may not be as well known in the West as Silicon Valley darlings like Uber Technologies, which was most recently valued at about $62.5 billion. But Ant Financial — whose controlling shareholder isAlibaba’s billionaire founder, Jack Ma — has become an online power in its own right. It is one of the biggest electronic payment companies in the world by virtue of Alipay, a payment service that is commonly used in China. It is also one of the most prominent symbols of strength in China’s private sector, particularly in the field of online payments. Slow-moving state-run banks and an initial absence of regulation have allowed privately run companies to weave themselves into everyday life. Ant Financial now encompasses not only online payments, but also low-risk money market funds and a wallet app that enables easy payment from smartphones around China. Chinese consumers use Alipay to shop online, transfer money to one another, hail taxis, buy movie tickets and even invest their spare change. A money-market fund affiliated with Ant Financial was once one of the world’s largest. According to the announcement on Tuesday, Alipay has more than 450 million users, or more than double the number PayPal has. Such is the power of the company that its latest financing was led by some of China’s biggest state-controlled banks, including arms of the China Construction Bank and China Life Insurance. That indicates the level of government support that the company enjoys in a country where much of the economy is still state-directed. Ant Financial’s previous fund-raising round, which was held last year, included China’s national social security fund and an arm of the China Development Bank. In a move that could further endear the company to Chinese officials, Mr. Ma has said he hopes to take Ant Financial public in China. Still, if Ant Financial follows through on the plan, it would be one of the biggest initial public offerings since that of Alibaba itself, which raisednearly $22 billion in 2014 in the biggest public offering on record.The Gannett-Tribune offer: No one knows what a newspaper is worth anymore:  Three years ago, Jeff Bezos paid $250 million for the Washington Post from the Graham family. Last year, Japanese publisher Nikkei paid $1.3 billion to take the Financial Times off the hands of the education conglomerate Pearson. Today’s $815 million bid to buy Tribune Publishing, from USA Today owner and newspaper chain Gannett, basically falls in the middle of those two recent deals. And it suggests that as print revenue continues to decline, there’s no such thing as a market price for newspapers anymore. Gannett is offering $12.25 a share (5.6 times Ebitda*), or a 63 percent premium on the current value of its stock, to buy the struggling newspaper publisher, which owns eleven dailies, including the Chicago Tribune and crown jewel Los Angeles Times. In 2013, Bezos paid what analyst Ken Doctor called a “friendship premium” of 17 times Ebitda; when Nikkei bought the FT, the going rate for European newspapers was 12 times Ebitda. Nikkei paid 35 times Ebitda. This isn’t a friendly offer, meaning Tribune might not play ball, but investors sure seem to dig it. Tribune Publishing’s stock opened the day by rocketing up more than 50 percent. Wall Street probably likes it because of Tribune’s dwindling print business, which justifies the lower Ebitda on the Gannett offer.Google Glass-based startup raises $17 million in funding: Augmedix Inc, a startup that uses Alphabet Inc's Google Glass to provide documentation services to doctors and other healthcare workers, said on Monday it had closed a $17 million funding round led by investment firm Redmile Group. Augmedix's employees transcribe doctors' notes and update patients' electronic medical record through Google Glass. The San Francisco company, which has raised $40 million so far, also said it had received investments from five U.S. healthcare networks, including Sutter Health and Dignity Health, which together have more than 100,000 healthcare workers. Augmedix, with 400 employees, said it serves doctors in nearly all 50 U.S. states. Funds raised will be used to build up the service to serve more health systems and private clinics, the company said. Augmedix is one of 10 partners authorized by Alphabet to deliver enterprise services through Google Glass.A Marriage Gone Bad: Walgreens Struggles to Shake Off Theranos: The sprawling drugstore chain, now a part of Walgreens Boots Alliance, was Theranos’s first — and thus far only — direct-to-consumer retail partner, promising to eventually make Theranos’s “wellness centers” an integral part of its more than 8,000 stores nationwide. When it announced the deal in 2013, Walgreens hoped to drive traffic to its stores and bask in the reflected glow from one of Silicon Valley’s hottest unicorns and its youthful founder and glamorous chief executive, Elizabeth Holmes. For unproved Theranos, the Walgreens endorsement was akin to the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. Theranos’s valuation vaulted to $9 billion and put Ms. Holmes on the Forbes list of billionaires. Nearly three years later, with Theranos under siege on multiple regulatory fronts and its reputation in tatters, it’s clear that the relationship has been a disaster for Walgreens. The company has been trying to distance itself, halting expansion of Theranos testing in its stores and, in January, threatening to end the partnership if Theranos did not meet regulatory standards within 30 days. But that deadline has come and gone. With this week’s news that Theranos is under criminal investigation for, among other things, possibly defrauding Walgreens and other investors, the question is: What will it take for Walgreens to end its troubled relationship? Theranos’s lawyers have taken a hard line, insisting that Walgreens is contractually bound by their agreement. So far, the approach has worked. Walgreens appears to have taken a cautious approach toward terminating the relationship, perhaps preferring to wait until federal regulators impose penalties or the criminal investigation yields formal charges, either of which would strengthen Walgreens’s hand. But that could take years. Theranos can appeal any penalties, and a grand jury investigation could be a protracted process. And Theranos is likely to sue Walgreens in any event if it terminates their agreement. In the meantime, Walgreens risks being dragged into nearly every negative story about Theranos.Inside One of the World’s Most Secretive iPhone Factories: A few minutes past 9 a.m. at Pegatron Corp.’s vast factory on Shanghai’s outskirts, thousands of workers dressed in pink jackets are getting ready to make iPhones. The men and women stare into face scanners and swipe badges at security turnstiles to clock in. The strict ID checks are there to make sure they don’t work excessive overtime. The process takes less than two seconds. This is the realm in which the world’s most profitable smartphones are made, part of Apple Inc.’s closely guarded supply chain. After years of accusations that employees in China were forced to work long, grueling hours, Pegatron and Apple adopted new procedures to keep iPhone assemblers from amassing excessive overtime. They’re eager to show how the system works, and for the first time are granting a western journalist access into the inner sanctum.The factory at the corner of Xiu Yan and Shen Jiang roads is one of the most secretive facilities at the heart of iPhone production and covers an area equal to almost 90 football fields. In the center is a plaza with a firehouse, police station and post office. There are shuttle buses, mega-cafeterias, landscaped lawns and koi ponds. The grey and brown-hued concrete buildings are meant to evoke traditional Chinese architecture. The brand-new Shanghai Disneyland, which opens its doors in June, is a 20-minute drive away.Inside, the factory still hides a secret, according to China Labor Watch. Base pay remains so low that workers need overtime simply to make ends meet, the advocacy group said. It said 1,261 pay stubs from Pegatron’s Shanghai facility from September and October 2015 show evidence of excessive overtime. Pegatron, an Asustek spinoff, is the world’s biggest contract electronics manufacturer after Foxconn, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Pegatron countered by saying the group miscounted because that period straddled state holidays, when pay was three times’ normal. Apple and Pegatron say they were never contacted by China Labor Watch, which said it approached Apple but didn’t get a response. Since March, the group said it’s collected an additional 441 pay stubs that point to continued excessive overtime. Back in the cafeteria, a group of women rush to finish lunch before their 50-minute break is over. They hail from across China, from Sichuan in the west to Shandong in the northeast. None has been there for more than a few months. “This is relaxed compared to other factories,” said Xu Na, 30, who followed her younger brother to work at the factory. “We never work more than 60 hours.”Flipkart is in the middle of a crisis of its own making—stalled growth compounded by management churn and the imminent possibility that it will cede the top slot to Amazon. But it’s not too late to change its strategy. Flipkart is in the middle of a storm of its own making: It is faced with a significant management churn at the top. For a company that pioneered e-commerce in the country, growth has virtually stalled since the middle of last year and the leadership team hasn’t figured out a way to kick-start sales. Its innovation engine isn’t firing. In e-commerce lingo, the gross merchandise volume (GMV) sold over a given period of time has not grown substantially. In the offline world, it is the equivalent of saying, the sales or revenue numbers aren’t growing. And this, for the e-commerce pioneer that until now grew its GMV by over 200% per annum for the past three years. The very culture that made Flipkart a runaway success in the first phase of its existence is now hindering its progress. The battle won’t be easy. Amazon will unleash Amazon Prime, Amazon Fresh and may even partner with offline retailers to consolidate its position as the default destination for online shopping. Amazon has rapidly scaled up its seller ecosystem and outstrips Flipkart today in several product categories. It has a chance to win India—and that is being handed over on a platter thanks to the internal confusion at Flipkart. Amazon is here to play a 20 year game—and any fumbles will cost competitors heavily. Now imagine the Flipkart investors’ dilemma. They’ve poured in over $3 billion and own over 80% of the company. They are neck deep in a business that is burning $50-70 million a month and has to get ready for the next phase of battle in the market. If the cost-cutting moves misfire and market share starts to shrink, the founders could very well put a request for another $500 million for the fight against Amazon. What will the investors do? A new investor is unlikely to step in. Even though the Chinese e-commerce players like Alibaba are waiting in the wings to swoop down on prized assets in India, there's a chance that they could choose to wait out this stage of the company’s evolution—why buy and restructure, when you can wait and buy a cleaned-up asset? Hence, one of the current investors will have to lead the round and it will put serious pressure on the team to show results. Flipkart has a last chance to redeem itself and take control of its destiny, else it will become another victim of early success. It is too big to fail and the market opportunity is too large to ignore. India will have more than one large e-commerce player—just the sheer potential of the market will keep it from consolidating for many years—and so, Flipkart’s existence is not in question. But the next few months will determine the destiny of the company. The A-team cannot afford to flounder so early in their journey. Apple Services Shut Down in China in Startling About-Face: For years, there has been a limit to the success of American technology companies in China. Capture too much market share or wield too much influence, and Beijing will push back. Apple has largely been an exception to that trend. Yet the Silicon Valley company is now facing a regulatory push against its services in China that could signal its good relations in the country may be turning. Last week, Apple’s iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in China, just six months after they were started there. Initially, Apple apparently had the government’s approval to introduce the services. But then a regulator, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, asserted its authority and demanded the closings, according to two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The about-face is startling, given Apple’s record in China. Unlike many other American tech companies, Apple has succeeded in introducing several new products — like its mobile payments system Apple Pay — in China recently. New resistance from the Chinese government to that expansion could potentially hurt the Cupertino, Calif., company. To a degree more than many tech companies, Apple relies on the smooth operation of its software — including its App Store and services like iTunes, which are tightly integrated with the iPhone and iPad — to keep customers coming back to its devices. Apple, which is facing a slowdown in sales of its iPhones, is also reliant on China for growth, so further moves by Beijing to curtail services could crimp sales. The company counts China as its second-largest market after the United States. Its China numbers will be dissected on Tuesday, when it reports quarterly earnings. China’s pushback against Apple shows that the company may finally be vulnerable to the heightened scrutiny that other American tech companies have faced in recent years. That scrutiny was spurred by revelations from the former United States National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden in 2013 of the use of American companies to conduct cyberespionage for Washington. China has sweeping goals in its move against Apple, said Daniel H. Rosen, founding partner of Rhodium Group, a New-York based advisory firm specializing in the Chinese economy. “They are interested in protecting the content that the Chinese people see, policing its national security and favoring indigenous giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent,” Mr. Rosen said. In this new era, he added, China “is strongly disinclined to accept the dominance of foreign players on the Internet, not least those from the United States.” Sales in China for those companies, including Cisco, IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, have slid as government oversight has increased. Some have grappled with raids, investigations and fines. Some have also been pressured to sell off holdings, hand over technology and work with local partners to expand their China businesses. Though Apple is one of the eight, it has had a much easier time - so far.Dell’s SecureWorks stumbles in first tech IPO of the year: It has been a dry year for tech IPOs. Up until today’s SecureWorks offering, there had been zero in the U.S. in 2016. Zero. This compares to seven in the same period last year and 24 in that timeframe the year before. So tech investors and late-stage private companies were watching SecureWorks closely, to see if the tech IPO window would reopen. It is one of the few indications we have right now to assess public investor appetite for tech IPOs. Unfortunately, SecureWorks faltered.The unicorn-sized security company split from Dell, although the computer manufacturer remains its majority owner. SecureWorks raised $112 million in the offering, after pricing its IPO at $14 per share. But the company was expecting the initial price to be between $15.50-$17.50. SecureWorks closed the day at $13.88, beneath the $14 IPO price. The offering certainly did not assuage concerns about the current environment for tech IPOs.Women’s coding school Hackbright Academy acquired for $18 million: Hackbright Academy, the San Francisco-based coding school for women, has been acquired by Capella Education for $18 million as the publicly traded education company looks to expand its efforts to train more women in technical careers.Hackbright, which was started in 2012, has graduated 364 women from its 12-week full-time fellowship programs. Another 279 women have graduated from its part-time program. Capella, meanwhile, is based in Minneapolis and specializes in degree programs for working adults, three quarters of whom are women. The deal closed Friday, the companies said, with all of Hackbright’s 25 employees joining Capella. Hackbright CEO Sharon Wienbar will continue to lead the team, reporting to Gilligan. Hackbright will continue to focus its efforts on in-person trainings exclusively for women, Wienbar said.In Asia, Netflix trips on regulation, content, and competition: Months after its global rollout, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) is facing problems in several major Asian markets as it struggles to provide enough strong content to attract consumers amid tough local competition, and also faces many regulatory hurdles, underlining concerns about disappointing subscriber numbers reported this week. From complaints that programming libraries offered in many countries are far smaller than in the United States to delays in offering its signature \"House of Cards\" series in some markets due to rights issues, the U.S. video streaming giant's January launch into 130 new markets worldwide, including a slew in Asia, has been bumpy. When it launched in Indonesia in January, for example, Netflix ran afoul of the film censorship board for carrying content deemed inappropriately violent or sexual. The communications ministry also demanded that Netflix set up a local office and pay Indonesian taxes.Netflix is still available in Indonesia via wifi connections and other carriers.In South Korea, where local content is popular and consumers have numerous streaming options, the Netflix site offers fewer than 20 local TV shows or movies.\"Korean Netflix's library in terms of content is pretty thin,\" said Jung Dong-yoon, a 29-year-old Seoul office worker and subscriber since January.Netflix had an explosive start in Australia, counting nearly 3 million Australians as viewers, OUT OF A population of 24 million, within nine months of its March 2015 launch. But growth has slowed just as dramatically, from a 55 percent leap between April and May to a rise of 4 percent between September and October, according to Roy Morgan research.Tipping Is Coming to Uber, and It’s Going to Be Awkward: Uber's mega settlement of as much as $100 million helps it solve a major legal liability around workforce classification, but another piece of the agreement could make for some uncomfortable situations in the near future. As part of the settlement with drivers in California and Massachusetts, Uber has agreed to notify customers more clearly that tips are not included in fares and give tacit approval for optional gratuity. Drivers can now solicit cash tips by asking passengers or posting signs in their vehicles. Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer representing the drivers, said riders should start seeing gratuities as a major part of an Uber driver's income. In other words, more like a cabbie. “I believe that, with this information, many riders will begin tipping their drivers, which will increase drivers’ pay substantially,” she said in a statement to the court. In the past, Uber tried to discourage tipping. During the company’s early days, its website said in 2011 that tips were included. Drivers complained that Uber was making its fares seem lower than they really were by rolling in a tip. In any case, they argued that Uber shouldn’t take a cut of the portion of the fare that was classified as a tip. The company eventually changed the way it described the cost of the ride. It currently says there’s no need to tip.Ev Williams’s Medium raised $57 million in September — now it’s raised another $50 million: You may have heard there’s a tech funding crunch, especially for companies that have yet to generate significant revenue. Not for Medium: The publishing platform says it raised another $50 million — just a few months after it raised $57 million. Update: Investors valued the company at $600 million in the current round, said a person familiar with the financing. This round was led by Spark Capital and includes previous investors Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures. CEO Ev Williams, whose stake in Twitter has made him a billionaire, is also putting money into his own companyReview: Curb, energy monitoring for an entire home: Curb is a comprehensive household energy monitoring system. The system monitors the entire home by using sensors installed in the circuit breaker. For many consumers this means being able to monitor the energy consumed by a clothes dryer or electric range or all the outlets and lights in a bedroom. It cannot, however, easily monitor and report how much energy is consumed by a computer or espresso machine. I had the system installed in my house over a month ago. It took licensed electrician about three hours. He had to install a sensor on each breaker and configure the system through an iPad app. This is not something an average homeowner can install themselves and that’s kind of the point. Curb aims to serve a homeowner with data not previously available. Other energy monitoring services either monitor the entire home or individual outlets. Curb sits in the middle of the two at the circuit break box. Each breaker gets a sensor and an app can display real-time consumption information as well as a dollar approximation of how much the energy is costing the homeowner. But what do I do with all this data? That’s where the system stops being useful. Obviously I can stop using my electric dryer and hang the clothes outside. Or teach my kids to turn off their lights. But I need help from there. The system should be able to display more historical data. Right now all it can do is show how much energy a particular circuit consumed — but now a total amount of watts. It can show how much power a home has consumed over a set of dates and also what the average was during that period. But what about the individual circuits? I want the system to let me dial down to a granule level. The web and smartphone app are basic at this point. The founder tells me the company is working towards implementing new features. The team is also playing with weekly emails that gives the consumer a breakdown of their energy usage and if anything abnormal occurred. Apparently, according to him, the system can identify when an appliance is consuming extra electricity, which could be a sign that it is nearing the end of its life. Currently, just after launch, the user experience of Curb leaves me wanting more. It is collecting so much information about my energy usage yet I feel it’s not benefiting me in a major way. Of course I should use appliances less.Yet the system shows a lot of promise in surprising ways. A few weeks family and I were standing in line for the Easter Bunny. This was the day before Easter so we were in line for over an hour. And like any good parent, I spent the time putzing around on my phone. Mindlessly, I opened the Curb app and discovered the stove was drawing power though I thought I had turned if off. I texted my neighbor who went over and discovered the oven was still on.China's Crowded Smartphone Market Heads for an Epic Shakeout: Smartphone sales in China exploded earlier this decade as incomes rose, prices for chips and displays plummeted, and carriers offered arrays of discounts. Shelves were flooded with hundreds of brands—from national heavyweights Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi to the smaller Dakele, Tecno Mobile and Gionee. Shipments more than doubled in each of the three years ending 2012, according to researcher Canalys. Xiaomi's valuation rocketed to $45 billion, and the phone maker started selling devices in India, the world’s fastest-growing major economy. Lenovo Group Ltd. spent $2.91 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility to help make it \"a global player.\" In 2011, only four of the top 10 vendors in China were domestic. Last year, there were eight.  Now that wave has crested. Smartphones no longer are novelties in China, and most domestic brands target the mid- and low-price ranges, where buyers don't upgrade as frequently as those for high-end Apple and Samsung phones. China's herd of 300 phone makers may be halved in 12 months by competition, a sales plateau and economic growth that's the slowest in a quarter-century, according to executives and analysts. \"The mobile-phone industry changed more quickly and brutally than expected,\" Dakele Chief Executive Officer Ding Xiuhong said on his Weibo messaging account. \"As a startup, we couldn’t find more strategies and methods to break through.\"Don’t want your startup to fail? Arianna Huffington tells founders to go to bed: Sleep deprivation is the undoing of startup founders, according to Arianna Huffington. “There is this kind of founder myth that if you are a founder you can’t afford to get enough sleep,” she told me over the phone while catching a plane back to New York. “The truth is three-quarters of startups fail and if founders got more sleep they’d have a better chance of succeeding.” Wanting to get more sleep isn’t the problem for most of us. It’s fitting in the recommended seven to 9 hours of sleep with work, eating, exercise, relationships and a social life – and on top of that founders need to spend a lot of time growing their fledgling company. The advice is obvious – no caffeine after 2 pm and keep your bedroom dark and quiet – but like exercise and eating right, a lot of us probably don’t do it anyway. And sacrifices will be made – no tech in the bedroom and you might not get through all of those critically acclaimed Netflix dramas – Arianna tells me she’s only seen one episode of House of Cards because sleep is the priority. But then, maybe you’ll think clearly and your startup won’t fail.Kahoot App Brings Urgency of a Quiz Show to the Classroom: Kahoot, an online quiz system from Norway that is fast gaining market share in schools across the United States, plays out like a television game show spliced with a video game. Cast in the role of game host, teachers introduce a multiple-choice quiz — on, say, plant life or English grammar. Using the Kahoot platform, they project one quiz question at a time onto a whiteboard or screen at the front of their classrooms. Players typically have 30 seconds to click an answer on their laptops, tablets or smartphones. They earn points for correct choices, and extra points for clicking faster. During the answer period, Kahoot emits a catchy countdown tune, reminiscent of retro video games like Monkey Island. A gong sounds when time is up, and the classroom board immediately tallies the class’s correct and incorrect answers. Next, a leaderboard appears, ranking the top five students by points accrued. Kahoot’s gamelike features and easy-to-use format have helped turn it into a classroom phenomenon. Of the 55 million elementary and secondary school students in the United States, about 20 million used Kahoot last month, the company said. “It’s fun. Everyone is doing it. It pulls all the children in,” Tosh McGaughy, a digital learning specialist at the Birdville Independent School District in Haltom City, Tex., told me recently. “They get competitive and excited.”Lyft Is Gaining on Uber as It Spends Big for Growth: In January, Lyft said it raised $1 billion, which is helping fuel the spending spree and steal market share from Uber Technologies Inc. To keep costs in check, Lyft has promised investors to cap its losses at no more than $50 million a month, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.Meanwhile, Uber has been working to fulfill its own promise to shareholders and employees that it would achieve profitability in North America by the second quarter of 2016, a milestone it says it has now reached in the U.S. and Canada. In February, Uber earned an average of 19¢ per ride in the U.S., according to previously undisclosed financial documents. Uber takes about a 25 percent cut of a typical fare, most of which goes to antifraud efforts, credit-card processing, customer support, marketing, and software development, the documents show. Not included in Uber’s profitability calculations are interest, taxes, or equity-based compensation for employees. Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick’s commitment to profitability has left an opening for Lyft, and the smaller upstart’s free-spending strategy is starting to pay off.  Lyft says it has captured 45 percent of trips in Austin, Texas, and Los Angeles and 43 percent in San Francisco, where both companies are based. Uber says it had 55 percent of ride-hailing sales in Austin, 75 percent in Los Angeles, and 66 percent in San Francisco, citing third-party credit card data from the first two weeks of March. Uber says Lyft has shaken loose only a few percentage points. “From everything I’m looking at, we’re gaining share in all top 20 markets, which is where 80 percent to 90 percent of rides happen,” says Lyft President John Zimmer. “This continues to prove what we said all along, which is once you hit a certain level of scale, it’s a natural duopoly.” Outside of big cities, though, it’s still Uber country. Of 169 million trips booked through Uber worldwide in March, the company says 50 million of those were in the U.S. Lyft says it did 11 million U.S. rides that month, up from 7 million in October. Lyft continues to devise new—and often expensive—ways to expand in the U.S., the only country in which it operates. When a Lyft driver refers someone to sign up as a new driver, both get a $750 bonus in some cities. And Lyft has the capacity to keep spending. Zimmer says the company still has “by far the majority” of the $2 billion it’s raised from investors. “This allows us to control our own destiny. We do not need to raise any additional capital, and it’s just a fantastic position to be in.” Whether Lyft’s gains will stick remains to be seen. Uber says customers lured away by subsidies are the most likely to return if Lyft’s prices go up. “It’s easy enough to buy trips with heavy subsidies for drivers and discounts for riders,” Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Uber, wrote in an e-mail. “But to build a successful, long-term business, you need a path to profitability—which Uber has always had.”GoPro’s developer program aims to connect its cameras to cars, toys and apps: GoPro on Thursday very quietly took the wraps off its new developer program, by which it hopes to get its action cameras hooked into as many third-party devices, vehicles and services as possible. The program was announced at a private event in San Francisco, where it showed off the fruits of various partnerships. The Periscope integration announced earlier this year is an example of what the company is hoping to achieve. There was also a snap-on time-code system that you can use to sync your footage (announced last week, but still new), a mount for kids’ toys from Fisher-Price and add-ons for tracking your route and vital statistics when parasailing, skiing and other extreme activities — you get the general idea. Partnerships with BMW and Toyota also suggest more automotive applications in the future. Perhaps the coolest item, shown off at the end of this highlight video, was a gesture-based camera control system for when your motorcycle gloves or [insert extreme garment here] prevent you from operating the app.Regulators plan to revoke Theranos’ federal license and ban founder Elizabeth Holmes: Theranos might find itself homeless soon. A federal agency plans to force founder Elizabeth Holmes out of her blood analysis startup for two years and take away the California lab’s federal license. First reported in the Wall Street Journal, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent a letter dated March 18 proposing sanctions barring Holmes and company president Sunny Balwani from owning or running operations in labs for at least two years – including in  both California and Arizona – and taking away federal licensing for Theranos’ California facilities in Newark and Palo Alto after Theranos’ continued failure to correct major problems with accuracy and competence. These actions would be a major financial blow to the startup valued at $9 billion. Theranos has the runway to keep working with approximately $700 million in the bank but the two labs make a good portion of the money for Theranos’ operations and a loss of the founder and president would strangle any hope of recovery.Artificial Intelligence for Everyday Use: How four programmers with almost no knowledge of Japanese designed software to read handwriting. Real-world artificial-intelligence applications are popping up in unexpected places—and much sooner than you might think. While winning a game of Go might be impressive, machine intelligence is also evolving to the point where it can be used by more people to do more things. That's how four engineers with almost zero knowledge of Japanese were able to create software, in just a few months, that can decipher handwriting in the language. The programmers at Reactive Inc. came up with an application that recognizes scrawled-out Japanese with 98.66 percent accuracy. The 18-month-old startup in Tokyo is part of a growing global community of coders and investors who are harnessing the power of neural networks to put AI to far more practical purposes than answering trivia or winning board games. \"Just a few years ago, you had to be a genius to do this,\" said David Malkin, who has a Ph.D. in machine learning but can barely string two Japanese sentences together. \"Now you can be a reasonably smart guy and make useful stuff. Going forward, it will be more about using imagination to apply this to real business situations.\" While handwriting recognition might be considered deep-learning 101, Japanese is a whole other ballgame. That's because the language includes symbolic characters such as kanji, which is composed of elements that can be read independently, making it difficult to know where one ends and another begins. There are also more than 2,000 common pictograms made up of dozens of strokes. The trick is to tackle one squiggle at a time. Reactive’s algorithm queries the neural network for a match, adds another stroke and repeats, all the while refining the probability of an accurate hit. The startup trained its model on about 1.8 million characters. Unlike a typical program built around rigid rules, deep-learning AI is modeled on how humans process information. Given enough data as inputs and a set of desired outputs, neural networks figure out what goes in the middle. This allows them to find solutions that have bedeviled traditional approaches, like interpreting speech or tagging images. And once built, a neural network doesn’t have to be limited to language applications. In their spare time, the four Reactive engineers showed the program 5,000 dresses downloaded from Google Images, then gave it a picture of a woman in a revealing outfit. \"Sexy clothes,\" the software responded.Verizon bets on Armstrong, M&A savvy in Yahoo bid:  Verizon is the clear favorite in the upcoming bidding for Yahoo's core Internet business, according to Wall Street analysts, in large part because the telecommunications company's efforts to become a force in Internet content have gone relatively well under the leadership of AOL Inc Chief Executive Tim Armstrong. Verizon acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion - its first big foray into the advertising-supported Internet business - and it is not yet clear how well the unit is performing financially. Subsequent moves, including the takeover of much of Microsoft Corp's advertising technology business, a deal to buy Millennial Media for about $250 million and the recent launch of the mobile video service go90, are also too recent to assess. Yet analysts have given the big phone company high marks for allowing AOL to operate independently and folding in other recent acquisitions without much drama. And they said Armstrong seems to be driving Verizon's recent moves in go90 and recent acquisitions. Verizon showed interest in Yahoo's core business as early as December, when Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said the company would \"see if there is a strategic fit\" for Yahoo's holdings, which include mail, news, sports and advertising technology. Yahoo, under pressure from activist investors, launched an auction of its core business in February after it shelved plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The first round of bidding is slated for next week, and Verizon plans to make a bid, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Verizon is already working on increasing revenue through its ad-supported mobile video service go90, targeted at millennials and built on video streaming technology acquired from Intel in 2014. The app, which launched in October, offers videos from Comedy Central and Vice, among others, as well as basketball and football games. However, analysts cautioned that even a combined Yahoo-AOL would lack the unique data, such as user interests and tastes, that powers its rivals in online ads, chiefly Google and Facebook. Armstrong, who made his name leading sales at Google, is highly regarded in the advertising community - in contrast to Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, another former Google high-flyer, who has been struggling to revive Yahoo. Mayer would likely leave after a Verizon-Yahoo deal, analysts saMore Startups Are Getting Lower Valuations Than Joining the Billion-Dollar Club: According to a new report from KPMG International and CB Insights, 2016 has seen a larger number of startups taking new lower valuations than those earning the billion-dollar badge. “The first quarter of 2016 has borne witness to high-profile unicorn company issues, layoffs, down rounds and mutual fund valuation markdowns,” according to the report. Only five venture capital–backed companies entered the $1 billion club in the same period, less than half the number from any quarter since the first quarter of 2015. Meanwhile, CB Insights’ Downround Tracker shows there were 19 \"down events\"—or companies raising new money or being acquired at a lower valuation—during that same time frame, including big names such as Foursquare Labs Inc., Gilt Groupe Inc., and Jawbone Inc. Those downgrades may also cause other startups to wait to raise new money if they anticipate having to take cuts themselves.Vietnam's young tech talent pulls foreign funds to booming startup scene: Vietnam's tech startups are emerging as a force to be reckoned with as foreign private equity funds bet the country's talented young brains will yield more successes like the international hit game Flappy Bird. Just last month, financial powerhouses Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered PLC raised their investment in the operator of e-wallet MoMo by $28 million, while Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist 500 Startups announced a $10 million Vietnam-focused fund. One of 500 Startups' shoestring investments is in automated marketing service Beeketing, founded by college drop-out Truong Manh Quan, 26, who estimates revenue this year of $2 million predominantly from customers in the United States. The startup boom is the latest chapter of Vietnam's growing presence in the global tech industry. In the three years since Hanoi-based .GEARS released Flappy Bird, Vietnam emerged from relative obscurity to become the Southeast Asian production hub of South Korean giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Meanwhile, global tech firms that have long had factories in Vietnam - such as LG Electronics Inc, Panasonic Corp, and Toshiba Corp - have also been expanding into research and development. Part of Vietnam's appeal is a cheaper workforce than in China, as well as membership of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade bloc and free trade deals with the European Union, plus incentives aimed at luring investment away from neighbors. Of particular interest to venture capitalists, however, is Vietnam's tech-savvy population with a median age of just 30.Alibaba Expands in Southeast Asia With $1 Billion Lazada Deal: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is making its largest overseas investment with a $1 billion deal for control of Lazada Group SA, taking the Chinese e-commerce giant to Southeast Asia and closer to a goal of shedding its home-market reliance. China’s largest online emporium will pay $500 million for new shares in the closely held company and purchase an equal amount from existing investors, Alibaba said in a statement. Investors selling include Germany’s Rocket Internet SE, British supermarket chain Tesco Plc and Investment AB Kinnevik. The Chinese company is buying its way into a region on the cusp of an online shopping boom, as fast-growing mobile and Internet usage propels consumer spending. Billionaire Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma has set a goal of getting at least half the company’s revenue from overseas, with the Lazada deal adding sales of clothing and electronics in six Southeast Asian markets. While the deal is Alibaba’s biggest deal abroad to date, the e-commerce giant is no stranger to mega-acquisitions. It agreed to pay about $5 billion to take full control of Chinese video service Youku Tudou Inc. in 2015. Alibaba shares were little changed in U.S. trading at $77.86 and have dropped 4.2 percent this year. The agreement values Lazada at $1.5 billion, Rocket said in a separate statement. It’s selling a 9.1 percent stake in Lazada and keeping an 8.8 percent slice. Alibaba’s deal values its entire stake in the company at about 15 times its total invested capital of 18 million euros ($21 million), the German technology company incubator said.Apple Watch verdict a year later: Half of those surveyed think it’s a dud: More than half of those surveyed by the advertising technology company Fluent said they considered the Apple Watch a flop. That sentiment — expressed by the majority of the 2,578 adults in the U.S. who responded last week to an online survey — reflects how the device is perceived by the tech press and industry insiders, many of whom have been pessimistic about the Apple Watch from the start. Asked whether they considered the Watch a successful product for Apple, 53 percent responded “no.” But Fluent’s survey also offers a more nuanced picture of Apple’s first wearable device,which launched on April 24, 2015. A significant majority of Apple Watch owners — 77 percent — consider the smartwatch a success and about two-thirds said they plan to upgrade when the next version comes out. Those owners surveyed said they take advantage of a range of the smartwatch’s features, including monitoring their activity and receiving notifications (79 percent), listening to music (75 percent) and checking email or chat (66 percent). This survey supports the more comprehensive findings of Wristly’s “Pulse on Wristware,” released earlier this year. The research group, which surveys some 2,500 smartwatch and fitness band owners every week, says that despite some views of the Apple Watch as a “mediocre novelty,” it enjoys “astoundingly high customer satisfaction ratings.”Israel to Levy New Taxes on Google, Facebook in Policy Shift: Israel has expanded its definition of who must pay taxes on commerce, targeting digital multinationals such as Facebook Inc. and Google that critics say get a free ride. Because much of today’s trade is carried out on the Internet, a foreign firm may now be considered a “permanent establishment” and subject to tax even if most of its presence is virtual, the Israel Tax Authority said in an e-mailed statement. The authority said Internet multinationals will be required to pay value-added tax, which is 17 percent for Israelis. The new taxes, which take effect immediately, will eventually add hundreds of millions of shekels a year to state revenue, the authority said. A Google representative in Israel couldn’t immediately be reached for comment. Facebook “pays taxes according to the law in every country it operates, including Israel,” a spokeswoman said via e-mail. Although Israel’s relatively small population of 8.5 million means the new taxes won’t clobber the international giants, they build on broader efforts worldwide to level the playing field between foreign Internet companies and local commerce. Russia is pushing to raise taxes on U.S. Internet companies to help its local industry and governments across Europe and beyond are trying to extract more revenue from Google, Apple Inc. and other multinationals with increasingly complex billing and ownership structures.Elon Musk’s SpaceX nails landing at sea: After several unsuccessful attempts to land an unmanned rocket on a football field-sized floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean, Elon Musk’s SpaceX finally pulled off the dramatic feat Friday afternoon in its first launch to resupply the International Space Station since its rocket exploded last year. The landing, the first ever of a rocket’s first stage at sea, was heralded as a breakthrough for the burgeoning commercial spaceflight industry, and its leader, SpaceX. The companies’ efforts to recover their rockets is part of what Bezos calls the “Holy Grail” quest of lowering the cost of space flight, which has been so prohibitively expensive that it has long been the exclusive domain of governments. Typically, the first stages of rockets are ditched into the ocean after firing their engines for a few minutes and boosting a second stage, or a capsule, to space. But if the commercial sector can build innovative rockets that can be reused, many think that would dramatically reduce the costs, a key step toward making space travel more routine. SpaceX broadcast the launch and landing live on its website, where some 80,000 viewers watched the booster descend toward the platform. The first stage was hurtling toward space when it started a bit of aerial acrobatics, turning itself around and heading back toward Earth. As it approached the platform, the booster was tilted into the wind but was able to right itself just before touching down, about nine minutes after liftoff. Crews were expected to board the ship and secure the rocket to the platform.Billing by Millionths of Pennies, Cloud Computing’s Giants Take In Billions: Imagine building an enormous beach resort, maybe the best in the world. Instead of renting the rooms, you charge guests based on the grains of sand they touch. You charge very little per grain, but if they lie on enough of them, it adds up. That is one way to think about what is going on at the world’s biggest cloud-computing companies. Instead of grains of sand, think about computing cycles, the activity that goes on in a computer server that is running software. For a price, think about one line of software code for two one-millionths of a penny. When tolls that tiny are paid often enough, they can make a billion-dollar business. At Amazon Web Services, which pioneered this method late last year, there is no charge for the first million times a customer runs code. Thereafter, A.W.S. charges by the million times, or for the hundreds of milliseconds the computer is used. “The scale at which we operate allows us to do innovative things,” said Matt Wood, general manager of product strategy at A.W.S. “When we get better economies of scale, we’ll use that to our advantage.” This economics of tiny things demonstrates the global power of the few companies, including Microsoft and Google, that can make fortunes counting this small and often. In other words, you have to be really big to worry about making money off things that are really tiny.China's $6 Billion Tech Funding Boom Signals Flight to Quality: If the startup funding party is finally breaking up, somebody forgot to tell China. The second-largest economy is avoiding the pitfalls affecting venture capital elsewhere, as investors around the world rein things in after an unprecedented technology financing boom. Ride-hailing app Didi Kuaidi, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s finance affiliate and online property service Homelink are close to raising at least $6 billion, people familiar with the separate deals say. The operator of Alipay, Alibaba’s affiliate, is targeting more than $3.5 billion alone, which would mark the technology industry’s largest single round of financing. All those numbers emerged over the space of just three days last week. In China, larger startups like them are attracting major backers and garnering the lion’s share of the money even as smaller operators are left to struggle. The frenetic pace is remarkable at a time venture investment globally is plateauing: there were fewer U.S. deals in the first three months than at any time in the past four years, according to research firm PitchBook Data. “China’s VC market is becoming very polarized,\" said Jarod Ji, an analyst at Beijing-based research firm Zero2IPO. “There’s not a lack of money in the market, but investors do feel that there’s a lack of good projects and that’s why companies like Didi are getting so much money.” The top 20 percent of Chinese startups could get 80 percent of the funding, he added.US Startup Funding Deals Fall to Lowest Level in Four Years - Different Story in India and China: Venture capitalists made fewer bets in the U.S. last quarter, while putting a larger proportion of their money into the most mature private companies, according to research firm PitchBook Data. The findings show that venture investors are trying to play it safe by backing proven businesses, making it more difficult for newer startups to find capital. Last quarter had the fewest number of venture deals in four years. Funding rounds dropped 12 percent compared with the fourth quarter of 2015, when startup funding began to slow. Investments totaled $17.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016, about flat with the prior period. More than half of that went to late-stage companies. Private investors are expressing skepticism as startup valuations have skyrocketed. Mutual fund companies have written down the value of their stakes in numerous technology companies since last year. Startups are staying private longer, leaving fewer options for shareholders to cash out. No tech company went public last quarter, and many of those that did in 2015 have gotten off to a rocky start. In other countries, there's plenty of money to go around. Venture capital investments in China and India surged in the first quarter, jumping about 50 percent.Alibaba Gives Shelter in Debt Storm as China Internet Bonds Gain: China’s Internet giants are providing a haven for bond investors fleeing mounting default risks among the nation’s state-owned enterprises. Investors are snapping up bonds from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., a bright spot in an economy growing at the slowest pace in a quarter-century. The rising demand also reflects a broader shift in China’s economy away from smokestack industries toward private-sector services such as e-commerce, online finance and entertainment. Creditors have grown wary of state-backed firms after Moody’s Investors Service cut its outlook on 38 of them along with the government in March. Dollar bonds from Internet firms have returned 4.2 percent this year, the nation’s best-performing sector, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Alibaba’s securities due 2034 have gained 9 percent since Dec. 31, while 2025 notes of Baidu and Tencent both returned more than 6 percent. Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce company, has cashed in by raising $4 billion from loan bankers and Tencent, operator of China’s most popular messaging services, borrowed $2.45 billion in December.Mashable Fires News Staff, Replaces Executives as Part of Pivot to Video Infotainment: Last week, the digital publication Mashable said that it had raised $15 million in a funding round led by Turner and that it would be using the money to “co-develop” content for TBS and TNT. Today, the other shoe dropped. The company announced that it is replacing its chief content and revenue officers — Jim Roberts and Seth Rogin — and firing a large portion of its editorial staff. Additionally, Mashable is pivoting from hard news coverage; it will focus on producing lots more video about “digital culture.” According to Politico and a Mashable editor, 30 people were laid off.\n",

      "Yahoo Paints Grim Financial Picture as Deadline for Bids Nears: As Yahoo asks potential bidders to submit first-round offers for its core business next week, it is also warning them about a troubling decline in revenue and profit while obscuring the costs and cash flow of various business units. Yahoo is projecting revenue of $4.4 billion this year, down from $5 billion last year, according to two people close to the bidding who have seen the confidential data the company has shared with potential bidders. That figure is on the low end of the revenue estimate the company shared publicly with investors in February. Even that revenue is coming at a cost, with Yahoo expecting to pay other sites about $1 billion this year for sending traffic to its advertising services. The company’s cash flow is also declining. Yahoo has reaffirmed to bidders its February projection that adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization would be about $750 million this year, down from $952 million in 2015. Initial bids are due at the end of next week, but that deadline might be pushed back. Starboard Value, an activist hedge fund that is seeking to replace Yahoo’s entire board of directors at the next shareholders’ meeting this summer, has repeatedly accused the company of running a halfhearted sales process. That sentiment has been echoed by some potential bidders. For example, Yahoo has told private equity firms and other financial players considering a bid that it considers them to be second-tier bidders, compared with so-called strategic bidders like Verizon and AT&T that would integrate Yahoo into their existing businesses.The surprising thing that got the biggest share of online shopping dollars in 2015: In a new report from the online metrics firm ComScore, researchers aimed to capture the ways our online shopping habits did (and did not) change in 2015, and the results contain some surprises. ComScore analyzed which shopping categories drew the biggest online sales in 2015. Computer hardware — a category that includes personal computers and tablets — has been the leader for at least a decade. But last year, for the first time, spending on apparel and accessories took the e-commerce crown. In three of out of four quarters in 2015, apparel and accessories pulled down the most dollars. For the year, clothing generated $51.5 billion in online sales, slightly edging out $51.1 billion spent on personal computers and tablets. In some ways, this might seem logical: Tablets sales growth has slowed overall as shoppers instead opt for smartphones with bigger screens. But recall, too, that 2015 wasn’t exactly a banner year for the apparel industry: Retailers from Macy’s to Gap reported gloomy sales results as shoppers chose to spend their money on things like travel and dining out. So the fact that online clothing sales surpassed computer hardware sales is likely telling us something bigger about customers’ online shopping patterns. For starters, it probably reflects retailers’ efforts to make it feel less risky to shop for clothes online. In other words, people are getting more used to the idea that if a pair of jeans doesn’t fit them quite as expected, or a sweater is not quite the same color blue it looked to be on a website, it can be returned with little hassle and often at no cost. Apparel also is among the categories that is seeing particular benefit from the explosive growth in shopping on smartphones. Lipsman said that many of the categories that registered particularly strong increases in online spending last year were ones in which the purchases are not “highly considered,” meaning that customers don’t spend much time researching before buying. These purchases are especially conducive to being made on a small screen, and so with the lion’s share of online shopping growth coming from mobile devices, they are getting a particular tailwind from this change in shopping habits.Daimler confirms HERE in talks with Amazon, Microsoft: Amazon.com and Microsoft are in talks about taking a minority stake in HERE, a digital mapping business controlled by Germany's luxury carmakers to help develop self-driving cars, Daimler said on Wednesday. Germany's luxury carmakers including Daimler's Mercedes, Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi division and BMW bought HERE for 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) from Nokia last year to create an alternative digital mapping business to Google.The consortium needs cloud computing providers to manage the mass of data collected from sensors on board thousands of Mercedes, BMW and Audi cars. The data about traffic and road conditions is then fed into digital maps.  \"We need a cloud provider to handle the huge amounts of data created by HERE and its users. We haven’t taken any decisions yet,\" Weber told the Wall Street Journal. Intelligent mapping systems supply information to control self-driving cars, which are equipped with street-scanning sensors to measure traffic and road conditions. This location data can in turn be shared with other map users. Yik Yak’s CTO drops out as the hyped anonymous app stagnates: Is Yik Yak a thing anymore? Not so much, according to download stats, traffic charts, surveys and a source that says the college app’s monthly user count has been declining. That source — with intimate knowledge of the company — also tipped me off that Yik Yak‘s original CTOTom Chernetsky has bailed, which the startup now confirms. He’s not the only one who thinks the supposed rocket ship won’t fly as high as some expected when Sequoia led a mammoth $62 million at $400 million valuation in November 2014. Since late last year, Yik Yak’s VP of Product, Director of Engineering, Lead Product Designer and other senior employees have departed. Months after Sequoia pumped a ton of cash into the Atlanta startup, download rates and traffic began to drop, according to App Annie and comScore charts dug up by GigaOm. Things have gotten worse since, as Google Play dropped it from its charts last March, likely due to hate speech in the app. These stats all mesh with what my source says, which is that Yik Yak has had zero significant growth in over a year, and consistently misses its growth targets. They cite 4 million monthly active users as the count in January, noting the number has declined since then, though I can’t confirm that exact number. The problem with anonymous apps is that over time they start to feel exhausting. The crude stories, played-out jokes stolen from Reddit and cringe-worthy bullying wear on people. While they might have a few juicy quips of their own to share, blowing off steam can eventually feel pointless. That’s why my Secret and Yik Yak usage dried up. Yik Yak’s product has continued to plod along, despite some colleges’ attempts to ban the app for facilitating cyberbullying. But nothing has made it feel fresh again.Virtual Reality Check: Rating the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift: JUST a week after Facebook released the Oculus Rift, the first high-powered virtual reality device for consumers, a less publicized contender has arrived: the HTC Vive. Similar to the Rift, the Vive — a joint development by the Taiwanese manufacturer HTC and the video game distribution company Valve — is a virtual reality headset that connects to a powerful computer. The Vive is even more expensive than the Rift — it costs $799 for the headset and $1,000 to $2,000 for a compatible computer. Facebook’sOculus sells the Rift headset for $599, or $1,500 when the system is bundled with a computer. The main advantage of the HTC Vive headset is that it comes with motion controllers, which let you effectively reach out and grab objects in virtual reality. This kind of interaction feels much more natural for virtual reality than the game controller included with the Rift. Also, the Vive’s motion-sensing base stations capture richer movements, enabling people to walk around in a larger space or crouch and grab something while using virtual reality; the Rift’s camera can detect movements, too, but the Rift was primarily designed to be used while standing or sitting. Another benefit of the Vive is that the headset fits better. With the Rift, I could always see a small gap in the space beneath the nose. The Vive headset completely blocks the outside world. HTC also includes a piece of foam that can be inserted into the Vive for a better fit for a narrower face. But a major downside of the Vive is the setup, which is more demanding than the Rift’s. HTC recommends that you drill mounts into the ceiling to install the motion-sensing base stations to ensure that the sensors have a clear line of sight with the headset and your body. In other words, to take full advantage of the Vive, you probably need to dedicate a room to virtual reality; to use the Rift, you can get away with clearing out a bit of standing space. The other obvious downside of the Vive is the higher cost. With a computer and accessories included in the total price, the Vive will cost roughly $300 more than the Rift. Then again, if you are willing to spend more than $1,000 for virtual reality, that extra $300 might not matter much. This is Year 1 of powerful and capable virtual reality systems coming to the mainstream. Over time, the content that will become available for these devices will define their worth. There isn’t much to do with either system yet, and consumers would be wise to wait to see if any killer virtual reality apps or games emerge for the systems.After a Pause, Nutanix Signals IPO Plans Are Back on Track: Nutanix, a supplier of storage products for data centers, just updated its paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, signaling that its plans for an initial public offering may no longer be on hold. The new filing shows that Nutanix, based in San Jose, Calif., nearly doubled its revenue in the six-month period ended Jan. 31, to $190 million from $102 million in the year-ago period. It ran a net loss of nearly $72 million, which increased from $56 million a year ago. Operating expenses rose to $190 million from $112 million previously. The company first filed for an IPO in December, but was reported to have put those plans on hold in February after markets turned south. After the Dell-owned security company SecureWorks, which is expected to offer about 20 percent of its shares in an IPO later this month, Nutanix would appear to be on track to be the second tech IPO of 2016.Salesforce.com Acquires Deep Learning Startup MetaMind: Cloud business software company Salesforce.com has acquired MetaMind, a startup focused on artificial learning that had been funded by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and venture capital firm Khosla Ventures. Terms were not disclosed, but it has all the markings of an “acqhire” sort of deal. Founder and CTO Richard Socher announced the deal in a post on the MetaMind website. Socher says on his personal website that his new title is Chief Scientist at Salesforce. MetaMind’s area of expertise is deep learning, the subset of artificial intelligence focused on data processing that is en vogue with Google, Facebook and other tech companies. The startup’s specialty is natural language processing — allowing computers to analyze relationships between words. Some of its capabilities disclosed in published researchdescribe advancements in the field that outrank those of some of the larger tech giants. Socher, a Stanford PhD, has said MetaMind’s plan was to sell this technology as a service to other companies. At MetaMind, he led a tiny group of researchers who gained a reputation for some rapid breakthroughs in the area of artificial intelligence. A Re/codereport from 2014 described how after only four months, the team came in only slightly behind Google in the ImageNet competition, in which companies compete to build systems that can recognize images.Toyota expands Microsoft partnership in connected vehicle services: Toyota Motor Corp is expanding a five-year-old partnership with Microsoft Corp to develop new internet-connected vehicle services for owners and dealers, Toyota said on Monday. The automaker has established Toyota Connected at its U.S. headquarters in Plano, Texas, to consolidate its existing connectivity services and serve as the company's \"data science\" hub. Microsoft has a 5 percent stake in the venture. Among the services to be developed or expanded under Toyota Connected are insurance coverage and rates based on owners' actual driving patterns; connected vehicle networks that can share information on traffic and weather conditions, such as icy roads; and information services tailored to a driver's habits and preferences, including monitoring heart rate, glucose level and other personal health data. The new wireless services will use Microsoft's cloud-based Azure platform. Toyota launched its initial partnership with Microsoft in 2011. Ford Motor Co introduced a similar program with Microsoft a year ago, and BMW AG and Nissan Motor Co announced Azure-based services earlier this year. Toyota Connected will use Microsoft's cloud technology to develop \"predictive, contextual and intuitive services\" to \"humanize the driving experience while pushing the technology into the background,\" Toyota said. Toyota Connected also will consolidate the automaker's current initiatives in data analytics, data management and data services for dealers and fleet customers. In addition, the new organization will provide support for Toyota's ongoing research in robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as development of self-driving cars.Microsoft’s mobile problem may not be a problem at all: When Microsoft announced its Windows 10 strategy last year, the thinking was that the unified platform would drive Windows Mobile and finally bring the Windows phone out of the doldrums where it’s been virtually forever. The idea was you could develop once for Windows 10 desktop and easily share that code on any device, making it impossibly attractive for developers, which would finally drive Windows Mobile popularity in a beautiful virtuous development cycle. Unfortunately, it hasn’t worked out that way, and Microsoft finds itself in an unusual position, developing software for iOS and Android because it simply doesn’t have a viable Windows mobile ecosystem. The question remains; can Microsoft succeed without a strong Windows mobile position? From the looks of things, they don’t seem to have much choice. Nadella appears to be staking his position in the cloud, which is a perfectly reasonable way to play it, while opening up his company’s tools to iOS and Android in the absence of any meaningful Windows phone adoption. When you look at the beauty of the mobile-cloud connection, it’s understandable Microsoft would want to be there with Windows, but perhaps Nadella is beginning to understand that Windows is not necessarily the future of the company — Azure and Office 365 are — and that could explain why the company stayed firmly focused on these two areas at Build. When you combine that with the idea of bots created by Microsoft, including Cortana (Microsoft’s talking virtual assistant), that can run in Microsoft’s tools or external platforms like Slack and LINE, you start to see a vision where Microsoft thrives even without an in-house mobile platform. As the world moves swiftly to that mobile-cloud intersection, perhaps the underlying OS becomes less important. If that’s the case — if Microsoft can have a piece of the underlying cloud-mobile plumbing and have apps and bots created in its ecosystem, run anywhere on any device — it renders the Windows phone gap irrelevant.Tesla says Model 3 orders top $10 billion in first 36 hours: Tesla Motors said orders for its new Model 3 electric sedan topped 253,000 in the first 36 hours -- a fast start for the company's first mass-market vehicle, which may not begin to reach customers for another 18 months or more. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the Model 3, which is slated to go into production in late 2017, will sell at an average price of $42,000, including the price of options and additional features, which would give the initial flurry of orders an estimated retail value of $10.6 billion. That intense interest, fanned in part by a steady stream of tweets by Musk, could help boost Tesla's stock price, which closed Friday at $237.59, up 3.4 percent. The stock has soared more than 60 percent since hitting a 12-month low in February. The car's average selling price projected by Musk is well above the $35,000 base price. Analysts earlier had estimated the first Model 3s off the factory line in Fremont, California, could be loaded with extra equipment and sell for $50,000 to$60,000. Tesla has undertaken a costly expansion of the Fremont plant, aiming to boost annual capacity to 500,000 by 2020, with production of the Model 3, the company's first mass-market car, ramping up slowly through 2019. Some analysts said the company could have trouble filling all the initial Model 3 orders, which are accompanied by a refundable $1,000 deposit, until 2020. Barclays analyst Brian Johnson on Friday said the heavy influx of Model 3 orders \"sets the stage for an equity offering\" later this year by Tesla, much of which would go toward factory construction and product development.China’s Companies Poised to Take Leap in Developing a Driverless Car: some argue that conditions in China are actually more favorable for quick adoption of driverless cars, in part because of more aggressive support from the national and local governments. And, unlike in the United States, China never fully developed a romance with the open road and car ownership. Car ownership has spiked in China, of course. And in recent years, it has become a middle-class status symbol to own a car. For the ultrawealthy, there are clubs dedicated to Ferraris and Maseratis. But enormous traffic jams in China’s largest cities can make driving a less-than-romantic experience. Why not let a machine built with artificial intelligence inside do the work for you? “It’s not that people are more willing to use the cars in Beijing or Shanghai, it’s that the economic value is much higher in China than in the U.S.,” Mr. Mosquet said, adding that air pollution could be as much a catalyst as bad traffic. Even as American companies like Google and Tesla work on autonomous vehicles, a number of Chinese companies are working on driverless car technology. The Internet company Leshi Internet Information & Technology (better known as Letv) has a driverless car tech unit, and the Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motors has opened a research center in Silicon Valley. The assumed leader in the field in China is the search engine company Baidu, which has been at work on autonomous vehicles since 2013.Jeff Bezos just live-tweeted his space company’s latest rocket launch: Opening the doors to his space company to the media for the first time last month, Jeff Bezos said he had kept the company so quiet and secretive for a simple reason: “We’ll talk about Blue Origin when we have something to talk about.” Now Bezos is talking — and tweeting. The billionaire founder of Amazon.com (and owner of The Washington Post) not only announced ahead of time that his space company would launch a rocket on Saturday, but he live-tweeted it, giving his followers a play-by-play of the event, and a few inside glimpses. Saturday’s liftoff from Blue Origin’s launch site in West Texas was the third consecutive time the company has launched and landed its reusable New Shepard suborbital vehicle, which consists of a rocket and a capsule designed to take astronauts just past the edge of space. While the company has yet to fly any humans — Bezos said that test flights with humans are probably a year away — it has now demonstrated that its rocket can fly repeatedly. Bezos, and others, believe that is a key step toward lowering the cost of spaceflight, and therefore making it more accessible. Typically the first stages of rockets are discarded after each use. But Bezos and SpaceX’s Elon Musk are developing technologies to land the first stages vertically, using the engine thrust to slow them down. The United Launch Alliance is also working to recover the engines of its new rocket. But in his live-tweeting Saturday, Bezos not only chronicled the launch and landing, but also showed how the company paints a turtle on the capsule to commemorate each successful launch. He even tweeted a picture of a pair of new cowboy boots with the company’s motto printed on them. That motto is “Gradatim Ferociter,” loosely translated to “Step by Step, Ferociously,” which captures the ethos of the company to move methodically toward its goals. That’s also why it uses the symbol of a tortoise, which moved slowly but still crossed the finish line ahead of the hare.Apple's Push to Flood India With Used iPhones Ignites Backlash: Apple Inc.’s latest attempt to crack the Indian smartphone market -- by selling used phones -- is meeting a wall of resistance. The iPhone maker is seeking permission to become the first company allowed to import and sell used phones into the country, its second attempt in as many years. This time, the stakes are higher and a growing number of industry executives are fighting the move, warning government officials in private that it’ll open the floodgates to electronic waste, jeopardize local players, and make a farce of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India program to encourage local manufacturing. “Make in India could turn into Dump in India,” said Sudhir Hasija, chairman of Karbonn Mobiles, who said it sells about 1.7 million phones a month. Apple’s application in 2015 was rejected by the environment ministry without much fanfare. But things have changed since: India, as the world’s second largest mobile population, now represents a vast untapped opportunity for Apple just as China and the U.S. are slowing. Apple has publicly talked up its prospects in India and is on course to get the green light to open its first retail stores. Apple now has less than 2 percent of an Indian market in which four-fifths of phones cost less than $150. Branded smartphones are available for as little as $35 in India. Western multinationals from car-makers to soda vendors use “India only” prices and cut-rate “India edition” products to woo customers. Apple can’t employ those strategies without tarnishing its marquee phone’s premium aura.Where's the lane? Self-driving cars confused by shabby U.S. roadways, Volvo CEO is not amused: Volvo's North American CEO, Lex Kerssemakers, lost his cool as the automaker's semi-autonomous prototype sporadically refused to drive itself during a press event at the Los Angeles Auto Show. \"It can't find the lane markings!\" Kerssemakers griped to Mayor Eric Garcetti, who was at the wheel. \"You need to paint the bloody roads here!\" Shoddy infrastructure has become a roadblock to the development of self-driving cars, vexing engineers and adding time and cost. Poor markings and uneven signage on the 3 million miles of paved roads in the United States are forcing automakers to develop more sophisticated sensors and maps to compensate, industry executives say. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently called the mundane issue of faded lane markings \"crazy,\" complaining they confused his semi-autonomous cars. In other developed countries, greater standardization of road signs and markings makes it easier for robot cars to navigate. In the U.S., however, traffic lights can be aligned vertically, horizontally or \"dog-house\" style in two columns. Pavement markings use paint with different degrees of reflectivity - or don't exist at all. \"If the lane fades, all hell breaks loose,\" said Christoph Mertz, a research scientist at Carnegie Mellon University. \"But cars have to handle these weird circumstances and have three different ways of doing things in case one fails.\" To make up for roadway aberrations, carmakers and their suppliers are incorporating multiple sensors, maps and data into their cars, all of which adds cost. Mercedes says the \"drive pilot\" system found in its recently unveiled luxury E Class 2017 sedans works even with no lane markings. The system - which incorporates 23 sensors - takes into account guard rails, barriers, and other cars to keep cars in their lanes up to 84 miles (135km) per hour, under \"suitable circumstances.\" Boston Consulting Group estimates that initial semi-autonomous features add $4,000 to a car's price.Government report details Theranos quality control issues: A government report released late Thursday accuses Theranos of producing inaccurate test results, of failing to meet its own lab standards and hiring unqualified personnel. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service visited Theranos’ main facilities in Newark, California last November and found the one drop blood test startup’s machines produced wildly inaccurate test results – including one for cancer detection, according to a redacted version of the report put out by the Wall Street Journal. The newly released 121-page report, obtained in full by the WSJ details quality control issues – including the failure to meet Theranos own standards. According to the report, erratic test results were frequent when tested in July 2014, and from February to June of 2015 on Theranos’ proprietary blood test machine Edison. One example – a test to measure a hormone affecting testosterone levels failed 87 percent of the time when run on Edison. It is unfathomable Theranos would be allowed to run test results for the public during this time. and these new details provide an inside look at some very real issues surrounding Theranos as a company, particularly around its code-named Edison technology – the supporting reason for the company’s $9 billion valuation.Inside the Little-Known Japan Firm Helping the FBI Crack iPhones: The little-known Japanese company at the center of a legal tussle between Apple Inc. and the U.S. government over the hacking of an iPhone built its business on pinball game machines and stumbled into the mobile phone security business almost by accident. Cellebrite Mobile Synchronization Ltd. worked with the FBI to crack an iPhone connected in a terrorist attack, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private. Neither Cellebrite nor the FBI have confirmed the link, and a spokesman from parent Sun Corp. on Thursday said the company isn’t able to comment on specific criminal cases. Sun, based in a small town of 100,000 southwest of Tokyo, has been building pinball-like game machines found in Japan’s pachinko parlors since the 1970s but has often displayed bigger tech ambitions. The Konan, Aichi-based company developed personal computers in the late 1970s, computer games and more recently, iPhone mahjong apps. In 2007, as sales slumped, Sun acquired Petah Tikva, Israel-based Cellebrite. Cellebrite hadn’t ventured into forensics at the time, and the purchase was mainly to add phone-to-phone data transfer to Sun’s fledgling telecommunications business, said the Japanese company’s spokesman Hidefumi Sugaya. When Cellebrite later took on investigative agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation as clients, the business took off, he said in a telephone interview. Today, the bulk of Sun’s mobile data solutions business comes from Cellebrite, said Sugaya. \"Although the FBI didn’t get a legal decision that would require Apple to hack around its own security software, it created a situation where they can go to third parties to do that,\" said Matt Larson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"Companies like Cellebrite may have found a niche industry of assisting the FBI unlock personal devices in select cases moving forward.\" Cellebrite sells hardware and software for extracting data from hand-held devices, even if it has been encrypted or deleted. It employs more than 500 people and has offices in Israel, the U.S., Brazil, Germany, Singapore and the U.K., according to its website.Founded in 1999, Cellebrite was bought by Sun Corp. for a reported $17.5 million. With $340 million in revenue, Nest is underperforming, and its future at Google is at risk:  Nest generated about $340 million in sales last year, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. That’s an impressive figure for a company in the very nascent market of Internet-connected devices. Nest currently sells three products: The flagship smart thermostat; Protect, its smoke detector; and Nest Cam, the home-monitoring video predecessor to Dropcam. But it’s below the initial expectations Google had set for Nest when it bought the startup in 2014 for a whopping $3.2 billion. The company’s sales performance may face even deeper scrutiny inside Google’s new parent company, Alphabet, where Nest now sits, as the hardware maker faces its most critical year ever. Alphabet, whose execs have spoken regularly about controlling costs at the non-Google companies, may become less charitable. And in the meanwhile, Nest's CEO got slammed in a column in TechCrunch for the culture there: though the company currently manufactures three products — its thermostat, a smoke alarm, and its Nest cam (via its Dropcam acquisition) — it has repeatedly delayed product releases and disappointed its customers, particularly given the billing that Nest’s products receive. In one of the more visible cases of customer dissatisfaction, a New York Times reporter said in January that a software bug drained his Nest thermostat’s battery, a discovery he made only when his infant began crying from his chilly bedroom in the middle of the night. Nest’s smart smoke alarm has also been plagued by software glitches. In the meantime, says The Information, Google has moved forward on similar efforts, including its OnHub wireless router and a stealth project to create a competitor to Amazon’s Echo. That Google has done so without Nest’s involvement must be demoralizing to Nest’s current employees, who were presumably drawn to the challenge of helping Nest become one of the world’s great hardware companies. But there’s reason for even more concern going forward: Fadell has created a culture that’s increasingly unlikely to attract the world’s best engineers, which has always been the top priority for its parent company. (Google, in stark contrast, is consistently ranked as one of thebest places to work.) If Alphabet wants to maintain its feel-good reputation, it may be time to part ways with Fadell, or at least to demote him. He’s now had more than two years to prove himself. What Fadell has shown instead is that he’s unable to get out of his own way — or Nest’s.Car-Pooling Helps Uber Go the Extra Mile: One day not long ago, an Uber driver picked up a passenger in San Francisco’s gritty Tenderloin district. Let’s call our passenger Abby, because her real name has been lost to database anonymization, an effort to keep her identity private. Abby needed to go to Noe Valley, a 25-minute drive that might ordinarily have cost about $15. But she had chosen UberPool, the ride-hailing company’s 18-month-old car-pooling program. In the process she had unwittingly initiated one of the service’s more epic recent trips. Unlike a standard Uber ride, in which a single rider starts a one-time trip, UberPool works like a party line for cars. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder and chief executive, describes it as the future of his company — and thus the future of transportation in America. Call up the app, specify your destination, and in exchange for a significant discount, UberPool matches you with other riders going the same way. The service might create a ride just for you, but just as often, it puts you in a ride that began long ago — one that has spanned several drop-offs and pickups, a kind of instant bus line created from collective urban demand. In total, Uber collected about $48 for the ride, of which the driver kept $35. The company had collapsed five separate rides into a single trip, saving about six miles of travel and removing several cars from the road. For riders, the discounts amounted to savings of at least half of a standard Uber trip. For the driver, an hourlong trip with no idle time resulted in steady earnings (Uber drivers make money only when riders are in the car). And though Uber made less from the single ride than it would have from multiple rides, the company benefited by installing itself as a fixture in people’s lives. UberPool may push us to re-evaluate how we think about Uber and its impact on the world.Elon Musk has a lot riding on his new Tesla: Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is poised to reveal his newest creation, the Model 3, at an event on Thursday. Starting at $35,000, the car represents Tesla's first electric vehicle aimed at price-conscious, mainstream consumers. And how it fares is going to have a major impact on Tesla's long-term future as a company — and the future of electric cars more broadly. That's why this unveiling is an incredibly important moment. Back in 2006, Musk laid out this vision in a blog post on Tesla's website: The strategy of Tesla is to enter at the high end of the market, where customers are prepared to pay a premium, and then drive down market as fast as possible to higher unit volume and lower prices with each successive model. In other words, this is the endgame. Although the company had focused first on high-end cars — the Tesla Roadster, the Model S, and the Model X — the ultimate goal was to bring the electric car to the masses. So for Tesla to have reached this point is going to be, naturally, a very big deal in the company's history. But that's not the only reason the Model 3 is significant. Tesla's new car is important in a very immediate sense because it offers Tesla a big chance at reversing some of the headwinds facing the company. You may recall that in October, Consumer Reports dinged the Model S for reliability problems, even though the same publication had otherwise issued aglowing review of the vehicle. Meanwhile, Tesla sales may have been affected by low oil prices that could be suppressing demand for electric vehicles, even as internal production issues hindered the company's supply. Not all of that is Tesla's fault, but it has prompted analysts to sour on Tesla's stock. Over the latter half of 2015, shares of Tesla fell roughly 15 percent from about $280 a share to $240. (It's now hovering at $230.) The Model 3 could be Tesla's opportunity to regain momentum.Beijing Seeks to Tighten Reins on Websites in China: China’s government said on Monday that it would take steps to more strictly manage websites in the country, its latest push to set boundaries in the wider Internet. A draft law posted by one of China’s technology regulators said that websites in the country would have to register domain names with local service providers and with the authorities. It was not clear whether the rule would apply to all websites or only to those hosted on servers in China. Chinese laws can be haphazardly enforced and are usually vague, and because the new rule is only a draft, analysts said they expected the regulator, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, to specify later to whom the law would apply. If the rule applies to all websites, it will have major implications and will effectively cut China out of the global Internet. By creating a domestic registry for websites, the rule would create a system of censorship in which only websites that have specifically registered with the Chinese government would be reachable from within the country. If the law applies only to sites hosted in China, it would still represent a consolidation of power by Beijing. Forcing registration with Chinese entities is likely to create a new boom in domain-name service registrars. At the moment, Alibaba operates China’s primary domain-name service provider, called Wan Wang. The new rule would also enable the Chinese government to keep closer tabs on the real identities of website operators. It would also help Beijing assemble a registry of important websites if China wants to break away from the global registry that unifies the Internet, Mr. Creemers said. The new rules are the latest in a string of measures taken by the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping to assert control over the Internet. This year, regulators created rules to block foreign companies from publishing online content in China without the government’s consent. Regulators also shut down the social media accounts of the sharp-tongued tycoon Ren Zhiqiang.No One Wants to Be ‘the Next Square’ Anymore: Makers of once-prominent credit card readers are retrenching or outright folding after Square’s disappointing IPO. A year ago, being known as the “Square of Canada” was a badge of honor. Payfirma Corp.’s smartphone-compatible credit card readers were in high demand, and local investors supplied the Vancouver startup with $13 million in funding. Like Jack Dorsey, the chief executive officer of Square Inc. (and Twitter Inc.), Payfirma CEO Michael Gokturk said he was aiming for “hypergrowth.” Gokturk doubled his staff to 80, including a chief operating officer formerly of Intuit Inc., and started talking about an initial public offering. But by November, being the “Square of” anywhere suddenly wasn’t such a hot title. That month, Square sold shares in an IPO that valued the company at about $2.9 billion, less than half its private valuation from a year earlier. In the runup to the IPO, analysts began questioning whether the card-reader maker should really be priced like a high-flying tech company. Its stock price is hovering around $13, right where it was after its first day of trading. “Now that they started going through the rigors of a public market, you can see that their market is actually quite limited,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “It’s going to be much harder going forward for companies that try to emulate their model to raise capital.” Spotify Expected to Sign $1 Billion Financing Deal: Spotify is about to close on a $1 billion deal that would double the amount of financing the music-streaming company has raised since its founding a decade ago, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday. The money comes in the form of convertible debt, which allows Spotify’s investors to change their securities into equity at a future date, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deal was not yet public. By using convertible debt, Spotify obtains the funds, without needing to change its valuation. The terms of the debt, however, may put pressure on the company to go public sooner. The company had an equity value of $8.4 billion last year. Funds associated with the private equity firm TPG as well as the investment firm Dragoneer put in $750 million of the $1 billion, with the rest coming from other institutional investors, the people said. The transaction, which was placed by Goldman Sachs, is expected to close on Friday, they said. The terms give the investors the ability to convert to equity at a discount to an initial public offering price, two of the people briefed on the matter said. The discount increases if Spotify waits longer than a year to do so, they said. The coupon payment on the debt would also continue to rise over time, the people said. The deal is similar to the one that Goldman Sachs arranged for Uber in January 2015. The ride-hailing company raised $1.6 billion in convertible debt. Should the company not go public within a certain time, the interest rate on those securities would climb. TPG Special Situations Partners, an $18 billion fund within TPG that does transactions other than leveraged buyouts, participated in the deal, as did TPG Growth, which has invested in other start-ups like Uber and Airbnb. Spotify may use the funds for acquisitions, investments and international expansion, the people said.U.S. Says It Has Unlocked iPhone Without Apple: The Justice Department said on Monday that it had found a way to unlock an iPhone without help from Apple, allowing the agency to withdraw its legal effort to compel the tech company to assist in a mass-shooting investigation. The decision to drop the case — which involved demanding Apple’s help to open an iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a gunman in the Decembershooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people — ends a legal standoff between the government and the world’s most valuable public company. The case had become increasingly contentious as Apple refused to help the authorities, inciting a debate about whether privacy or security was more important. Yet law enforcement’s ability to now unlock an iPhone through an alternative method raises new uncertainties, including questions about the strength of security in Apple devices. The development also creates potential for new conflicts between the government and Apple about the method used to open the device and whether that technique will be disclosed. Lawyers for Apple have previously said the company would want to know the procedure used to crack open the smartphone, yet the government might classify the method. A second law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reporters in a conference call said that a company outside the government provided the F.B.I. with the means to get into the phone used by Mr. Farook, which is an iPhone 5C running Apple’s iOS 9 mobile operating system. The official would not name the company or discuss how it was accomplished, nor would officials say whether the process would ultimately be shared with Apple.Uber profits elsewhere support 'sustainable' spending in China: CEO: Ride hailing app company Uber Technologies Inc is generating more than $1 billion in profit a year in its top 30 cities globally, and partly using that money to bankroll its expansion in China, Chief Executive Travis Kalanick said in an interview. The company said in February it was losing more than $1 billion a year in China's red-hot ride hailing market, where it is battling large local incumbents to win customers. Kalanick said China was the company's most intense market, but also a crucible for new ideas that it has exported to other markets, and that its investment here was sustainable. \"If you took our top 30 cities today, today they're generating over $1 billion in profit a year, just our top 30 cities. And that profit multiplies every year because we're growing,\" he said on the sidelines of the Boao Forum in the Chinese island province of Hainan. Other cities among the 400 where Uber operates were also profitable, he added.The Uber Model, It Turns Out, Doesn’t Translate: Other than Uber, the hypersuccessful granddaddy of on-demand apps, many of these companies have come under stress. Across a variety of on-demand apps, prices are rising, service is declining, business models are shifting, and in some cases, companies are closing down. Here is what we are witnessing: the end of the on-demand dream. That dream was about price and convenience. Many of these companies marketed themselves as clever hacks of the existing order. They weren’t just less headache than old-world services, but because they were using phones to eliminate inefficiencies, they argued that they could be cheaper, too — so cheap that as they grew, they could offer luxury-level service at mass-market prices. So do a lot of other apps offering services across a number of industries. They are super convenient, but the convenience comes at a premium, which seems here to stay. Some of these services could make for fine businesses, but it is hard to call them groundbreaking. After all, paying extra for convenience isn’t really innovative — it is pretty much how the world has always worked. Before we get to why many on-demand apps have struggled to achieve mass-market prices, it is important to remember why anyone ever thought they could: because Uber did it. The ride-hailing company that is valued by investors at more than $60 billion began as a luxury service. The magic of Uber was that it used its growth to keep cutting its prices and expand its service. Uber shifted from a convenient alternative to luxury cars to an alternative to taxis to, now, a credible alternative to owning a car. But Uber’s success was in many ways unique. For one thing, it was attacking a vulnerable market. In many cities, the taxi business was a customer-unfriendly protectionist racket that artificially inflated prices and cared little about customer service. The opportunity for Uber to become a regular part of people’s lives was huge. Many people take cars every day, so hook them once and you have repeat customers. Finally, cars are the second-most-expensive things people buy, and the most frequent thing we do with them is park. That monumental inefficiency left Uber ample room to extract a profit even after undercutting what we now pay for cars. But how many other markets are there like that? Not many. Some services were used frequently by consumers, but weren’t that valuable — things related to food, for instance, offered low margins. Other businesses funded in low-frequency and low-value areas “were a trap,” Mr. Walk said.Why you should be skeptical that any video is real: Be careful about believing what your eyes are telling you. Researchers have shown how a video of a person talking can be altered in real time to change what a speaker appears to be saying. In a new video, the scientists show how they edited YouTube clips to change mouth movements. The system uses a webcam to track one person’s facial expressions, and then applies them to the face of the person in the target video. The software creates a 3D representation of a subject’s face, which can then be swapped with the 3D representation of another face. The process works even if one subject has facial hair or a different skin tone. But it won’t work if a person’s long hair blocks his or her mouth. Currently the researchers are considering commercializing the technology for use in TV shows that are re-released in a different language. Editing actors’ facial movements to match the audio should make the dubbed programs seem more natural, even if what’s onscreen is actually fake.Why I’m skeptical about Apple’s future: Facebook is set to release its virtual reality headset, Oculus, next week. It will be big and clunky, expensive, and cause nausea and other problems for its users. Within a few months, we will declare our disappointment with virtual reality itself while Facebook listens very carefully to its users and develops improvements in its technology. Version 3 of this, most likely in 2018 or 2019,will be amazing. It will change the way we interact with each other on social media and take us into new worlds — like the holodecks we saw in the TV series Star Trek. This is the way innovation happens now. You release a basic product and let the market tell you how to make it better. There is no time to get it perfect; it may become obsolete even before it is released. Apple hasn’t figured this out yet. It maintains a fortress of secrecy and its leaders dictate product features. When it releases a new technology, it goes to extremes to ensure elegant design and perfection. Steve Jobs was a true visionary who refused to listen to customers — believing that he knew better than they did about what they needed. He ruled with an iron fist and did not tolerate dissent of any type. People in one division of Apple also did not know what others in the company were developing, that is the type of secrecy the company maintained. Jobs’s tactics worked very well for him and he created the most valuable company in the world. But without Jobs — and given the dramatic technology changes that are happening, Apple may have peaked. It is headed the way of IBM in the ’90s and Microsoft in the late 2000’s. Consider that its last major innovation — the iPhone — was released in June 2007. Since then, it has been tweaking its componentry, adding faster processors and more advanced sensors, and releasing this in bigger and smaller form factors—as with the iPad and Apple Watch. Even the announcements that Apple made Monday were uninspiring: smaller iPhones and iPads. All it seems to be doing is playing catch up with Samsung, which offers tablets and phones of many sizes and has better features.  It has been also been copying products such as Google Maps and not doing this very well.Uber-Ola battle goes from the streets to court: Uber alleges Ola employees are making bookings on its platform by creating fake accounts, seeks Rs50 crore in damages; Ola denies the charges. Uber alleged that Ola is intentionally causing it to lose sales. Uber alleged in court that Ola’s employees are making bookings on Uber’s platform by creating fake accounts and then cancelling them. This is the equivalent of a shopping site’s employee placing orders on a rival site and then returning the goods for no good reason. Uber calculated the total loss incurred by it because of such alleged practices by Ola and sought damages worthRs.496,164,780 from the latter. A total of “93,859 fake accounts” have been created by Ola, which have been used to make “4,05,649 false bookings” across various cities that were later cancelled, it said. Such cancellations roughly amounted to 8-10% of its total bookings, Uber added. Uber and Ola are fighting for dominance of India’s cab business that, according to Ola’s largest investor SoftBank Group, may be worth $7 billion by 2020. Justice Vipin Sanghi, who was hearing the matter, issued notices to both ANI Technologies Ltd (Ola) and Serendipity Infolabs (TaxiForSure, acquired by Ola) asking for replies to be filed before the next date. Ola’s statement denying all allegations was also recorded. A day after Alexander’s interview was published, a senior Ola official said the company’s newly launched low-cost offering, Micro, will soon do more daily cab rides than all of Uber India.According to US-based Uber, the company has wiped out Ola’s massive lead in a year. “In January last year, we were at 5% market share. Now we are right at the edge of 50%. I would say that within the next 30 days we would beat them (Ola). We will surpass them very, very shortly,” Alexander had said in an interview on 16 March.Chip-Card Payment System Delays Frustrate Retailers: Avi Kaner, a co-owner of the Morton Williams supermarket chain in New York, has spent about $700,000 to update the payment terminals at his stores. Trouble is, he cannot turn them on. The new terminals can accept credit and debit cards with embedded digital chips, a security feature intended to reduce the number of fraudulent purchases. But before the payment systems can work, they must be certified, a process that Mr. Kaner and many retailers around the country are waiting to happen. In the case of Morton Williams, the holdup has lasted several months. The cost of waiting, retailers say, is piling up. Until recently, banks covered much of the cost of fraudulent purchases. Since Oct. 1, though, merchants that cannot accept chip cards have had to shoulder the cost of fraud, and banks have not been shy about passing along the bill. “It’s been very frustrating,” Mr. Kaner said in an interview last week at his office in the Bronx, the home of his family-owned business. He bought most of the equipment he needed before Oct. 1, he said, and has been waiting months to get it certified. The delay, he said, pointing to a tall pile of paperwork, has cost him thousands of dollars in payments for fraudulent purchases. The long delays are just the latest black eye for the deployment of the new systems. Some consumers have not yet received new cards. Many merchants have not bought the updated equipment. And even when the cards and the terminals have been updated, they have generated confusion and slow lines. Many of the complications were widely predicted, but the certification system has added an unexpected wrinkle — and lots of finger-pointing. Banks say that retailers waited till the last minute to update their terminals. Retailers point to financial ties between the banks and the companies that provide certification, saying there is no motivation to move faster.Uber offers hackers 'treasure map' to find computer flaws: Uber, the high-flying transportation firm, is releasing a technical map of its computer and communications systems and inviting hackers to find weaknesses in exchange for cash bounties. While so-called \"bug bounties\" are not new, Uber's move shows how mainstream companies are increasingly relying on independent computer researchers to help them bolster their systems. It also indicates growing acceptance of the idea that making computer code public can make systems more secure, a philosophy that has long been advocated by the open-source software movement. Uber's “Treasure Map” details the ride-hailing company's software infrastructure, identifies what sorts of data might be exposed inadvertently and suggests what types of flaws are the most likely to be found. HackerOne, a San Francisco rival called Bugcrowd and other startups have helped accelerate efforts to tap the independent security community to identify serious programming mistakes before criminals or spies do. They can serve as intermediaries between researchers and companies, and sometimes vet their findings. A decade ago, hackers pointing out problems feared arrest but they can now earn modest sums from platforms like HackerOne. Firms such as Uber, looking to bolster their defenses, don’t pay as much as criminals and military contractors who are looking for tools to carry out offensive attacks, but they offer options to those who would prefer to act as \"white hats.\" Bugcrowd Chief Executive Officer Casey Ellis said he has seen a surge in corporate clients asking for private bounty programs that are open to selected researchers. “That increases the amount of trust you are giving to the researchers,” Ellis said. “We run trusted programs where people get prerelease versions of Internet of Things devices or access to source code.Domo takes on Slack with $130 million at $2 billion+ valuation: Utah-based Domo has been a force in the enterprise space for a few years with its data management platforms, but the team is poised for growth with an additional $130 million in Series D funding from existing and new investors, including BlackRock, Credit Suisse and others. These $130 million are an addition to Domo’s previously announced $200 million Series D round. The company says it is now valued at $2 billion.  “We didn’t need the money,” Domo founder and CEO Josh James said of the funding round. He called it a “nice buffer,” but insists that the team didn’t need the cash and plans to go public within the year. Domo also today launched its app store, a mix of about 1,000 free and freemium apps, which can be customized for any company. The company is also introducing a free messaging service with threaded conversations, which James refers to as a Slack competitor. With more than 1,000 customers, including eBay and MasterCard, James said the team has achieved $100 million in bookings so far and that revenue is doubling. Domo has 800 employees and may hire another 500 in 2016. James previously founded web analytics platform Omniture, taking it public and eventually selling it to Adobe for $1.8 billion. The serial entrepreneur thinks he has what it takes to build something even bigger.Apple’s Modest Product Upgrades Take Back Seat to Worries on iPhone Encryption: Apple held one of its regular product showcases on Monday, but this time the products did not take center stage. Before the Silicon Valley giant unveiled modest upgrades to its device lineup, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, defended the company’s stance in its fight with the federal government over the encryption on iPhones. The case had been expected to head to a court hearing on Tuesday, but the Justice Department abruptly moved on Monday to cancel the hearing, saying it might not need Apple’s help to break into the phone used by a gunman in last year’s San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting. In a news conference at Apple’s Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Mr. Cook stressed that the company would stand fast. “We need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy,” Mr. Cook said. “This is an issue that impacts all of us, and we will not shrink from this responsibility.”A Smaller iPhone, Cheaper iPad and Watch at Tepid Product Event By Apple:  Apple introduced a smaller iPhone, a smaller iPad Pro and new bands for the Apple Watch. The company introduced smaller versions of its flagship iPhone and iPaddevices, hoping to eke out more sales growth by filling gaps in its product lineup. The new devices, the iPhone SE and a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, represent a return to the form factors that prevailed before Apple supersized its smartphones in 2014 and added the large, business-oriented iPad Pro last year. So Apple upgraded the components of its new four-inch phone to largely match the speed and features of its flagship iPhone 6s, but at a lower price, starting at $399. The new 9.7-inch iPad Pro brings some of the features of last year’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro, including a stylus, a keyboard and four speakers, to a tablet the size of the consumer-oriented 9.7-inch iPad Air 2. The new Pro will start at $599, and Apple also cut the price of the Air 2 by $100 to start at $399. Apple also reduced the price of the Apple Watch by $100, to $299, and introduced new woven nylon wristbands for the device. More than one-third of Watch owners have more than one band, Mr. Cook said. Analysts say sales have been modest for the watch, which works as a companion to the iPhone. The price cut might encourage more people to give it a try. But Apple also acknowledges that the smartwatch category is in its infancy and it may take several more generations of the device before it really catches on.Apple's new iPhone faces challenge measuring up in China, India: Apple's new iPhone SE has first-rate features and a relatively low price tag, but its prospects in key markets like China and India may be limited by its diminutive size. At the product launch in Cupertino, California on Monday, Apple vice president of iPhone Product Marketing Greg Joswiak singled out China as a target market, saying four-inch displays like that on the iPhone SE were still popular with first-time smartphone buyers. Chinese buyers tend to start off with a phone with a 4-inch screen, just like the iPhone SE, he argued. China, Apple's second-biggest market, and India, one of the fastest-growing major markets in the world, are both seen as key for Apple, which expects overall iPhone sales to contract. The iPhone SE is seen as particularly important for India, where Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner, expects the smartphones market to double to 200 million units in the next two years. But in India and China, smartphones are often the main connection to the digital world, and a big screen is highly valued, analysts said. \"(In India) the majority of the low-end, $100 phones have a five-inch display. The key reason being smartphone users are becoming more mature are preferring bigger screen size as many of them don't own a tablet or laptop,\" said Neil Shah, research director at Counterpoint Technology Market Research based in Mumbai.Only 10 percent of smartphones sold in India at the end of December had a four-inch screen, according to Counterpoint, and Apple accounted for only two percent of overall smartphone shipments in India last year.Andy Grove, Valley Veteran Who Founded Intel, Dies at 79: Andy Grove, who escaped the ruins of postwar Europe to become one of the architects of Silicon Valley’s growth into the world’s center of technology creation, died Monday. He was 79. The Hungarian-born refugee was one of the founders of Santa Clara, California-based Intel, playing a key role in building the company from a startup in the 1960s to the world’s largest semiconductor maker, a title it still holds. Grove, who literally wrote the book on how to foresee and overcome a corporate crisis with “Only the Paranoid Survive,” also broke new ground by making the component maker a household name central to the worldwide adoption of the personal computer.  Arriving in the U.S. with less than $20 in his pocket, Grove was taken in by relatives in New York. He studied chemical engineering at City College and graduated at the top of his class, teaching himself English along the way.He moved to the West Coast to attend the University of California at Berkeley, where he earned a Ph.D. in chemical engineering in 1963. After graduating, he joined Fairchild Semiconductor, home to a future group of semiconductor industry leaders who would give Silicon Valley its name. In 1968, he followed Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce out the door as Intel’s first hire. For the founders of Intel, Grove was the perfect fit. Moore and Noyce, both inventors in their own right, were opposite personalities: one studious and low-key, the other a born salesman. In the middle was Grove, a writer of scientific textbooks who brought a fear of failure to the laid-back culture of Silicon Valley in the early 1970s. As a detail-obsessed taskmaster, he forced Intel workers, including Moore, to sign in if they arrived at work after 8 a.m. Always seeking to pass along the benefits of his experiences, Grove acted as a mentor to many of Silicon Valley’s elite -- from Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg.A beginner’s guide to finally buying a virtual reality headset: if you are interested in being an early adopter,  here's a quick guide of the basics, plus a little input from my experiences with these products. Sony Playstation VR (PS VR) Buy if: You have a PlayStation already, or are looking to make a slightly smaller investment. Oculus Rift: After a long wait, Oculus opened preorders for the Rift headset, the first of which are expected to arrive at the end of March. The Rift is due to hit store shelves in April. Buy if: You want a stellar experience over everything else. Oculus was the first really big name to come out of the VR space and has probably done the most to minimize motion sickness. Samsung Gear VR: Powered by Oculus's technology and Samsung's smartphones, the Gear VR was first released in 2015 and is getting a renewed PR push with the new Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones. Buy if: You're really watching your budget and are happy with some smaller-scale experiences. HTC Vive: The product of a partnership between Taiwanese tech giant HTC and the video game company Valve, the HTC Vive is due to ship its first orders in April. Buy if: You really want an early version of a Star Trek-style Holodeck and have the room to make one.Uber seeking to buy self-driving cars: source: Ride-hailing service Uber has sounded out car companies about placing a large order for self-driving cars, an auto industry source said on Friday. \"They wanted autonomous cars,\" the source, who declined to be named, said. \"It seemed like they were shopping around.\" Loss-making Uber would make drastic savings on its biggest cost -- drivers -- if it were able to incorporate self-driving cars into its fleet. Earlier on Friday, Germany's Manager Magazin reported that Uber had placed an order for at least 100,000 Mercedes S-Class cars, citing sources at both companies. The top-flight limousine, around 100,000 of which Mercedes-Benz sold last year, does not yet have fully autonomous driving functionality. Auto industry executives are wary of doing deals with newcomers from the technology and software business who threaten to upend established business models based on manufacturing and selling cars. \"We don't want to end up like Nokia's handset business, which was once hugely profitable...then disappeared,\" a second auto industry source said about doing a deal with Uber. A key hurdle to driverless cars has been the question of liability in the event of an accident. Most countries are signatories to the 1968 United Nations Convention on Road Traffic which stipulates that a person, rather than a computer, must be in control of a vehicle. In February this year, U.S. vehicle safety regulators softened the rules to allow driverless cars, by saying an artificial intelligence system piloting a self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal law, a major step toward ultimately winning approval for autonomous vehicles on the roads.How real businesses are using machine learning: There is no question that machine learning is at the top of the hype curve. And, of course, the backlash is already in full force: I’ve heard that old joke “Machine learning is like teenage sex; everyone is talking about it, no one is actually doing it” about 20 times in the past week alone.But from where I sit, running a company that enables a huge number of real-world machine-learning projects, it’s clear that machine learning is already forcing massive changes in the way companies operate. So where is it happening? Here are a few behind-the-scenes applications that make life better every day. Making user-generated content valuable: The average piece of user-generated content (UGC) is awful. It’s actually way worse than you think. It can be rife with misspellings, vulgarity or flat-out wrong information. But by identifying the best and worst UGC, machine-learning models can filter out the bad and bubble up the good without needing a real person to tag each piece of content. Pinterest uses machine learning to show you more interesting content. Yelp uses machine learning to sort through user-uploaded photos. NextDoor uses machine learning to sort through content on their message boards. Disqus uses machine learning to weed out spammy comments. Finding products faster: Successful e-commerce startups from Lyst to Trunk Archive employ machine learning to show high-quality content to their users. Other startups, like Rich Relevance and Edgecase, employ machine-learning strategies to give their commerce customers the benefits of machine learning when their users are browsing for products. Engaging with customers: You may have noticed “contact us” forms getting leaner in recent years. That’s another place where machine learning has helped streamline business processes. Instead of having users self-select an issue and fill out endless form fields, machine learning can look at the substance of a request and route it to the right place. Understanding customer behavior: Machine learning also excels at sentiment analysis. And while public opinion can sometimes seem squishy to non-marketing folks, it actually drives a lot of big decisions. For example, say a movie studio puts out a trailer for a summer blockbuster. They can monitor social chatter to see what’s resonating with their target audience, then tweak their ads immediately to surface what people are actually responding to - that puts people in theaters.Why unicorns falter: In early February 2016, a study of financing deals reported by The Wall Street Journal found that investors are increasingly protecting themselves from IPOs that don’t perform as expected. This fallout is a continuation of the demise of the so-called “unicorn,” a tech startup with a pre-IPO valuation of over one billion dollars. As these companies secure late-stage funding before their public market exit, smart private investors are setting terms that ensure they don’t lose a dime if the IPO falls short of expectations. This comes at a great cost to the startup if the exit doesn’t deliver, as was the case for many of the IPOs of 2015. The unicorn investment cycle has been consuming the growth ramp of an IPO-bound company. Unlike previous eras when a public exit occurred earlier in the company’s growth, leaving the best days ahead of the company, the fastest growth for an IPO-bound startup now happens in the last funding rounds before an IPO. This leaves a 20-30 percent growth rate post-IPO, which is pretty good for a company at $100-$200 million/year revenue, but bad for anyone looking for greater than 2X ROI from an IPO investment. Addressing these issues requires a little course correction as companies work toward an IPO. To ensure ample room for future growth, a startup should be careful not to push its market cap too high by taking more funding rounds than needed during the growth-stage period before IPO. This can be a challenge because funding often generates media interest and credibility, which are certainly not things a young company wants to leave on the table. However, leaving a portion of its growth for the IPO will ensure that the company has enough runway to continue to grow and deliver for its public market investors, just as the company has done for its VCs. Otherwise, you create yet another unicorn where the late-stage investors garner all the potential gains, and even force guarantees on returns. This is bad for new investors in the open market, and worse for the employees of the company who only receive poor post-lockup stock performance as compensation for years of hard work and sacrifices.Facebook's Zuckerberg meets propaganda czar in China charm drive: Facebook's co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg met China's propaganda tsar Liu Yunshan in Beijing on Saturday as part of a charm offensive in one of the few markets where the social network cannot be accessed. The rare meeting, reported by China's state news agency Xinhua, suggests warming relations between Facebook and the Chinese government, even as Beijing steps up censorship of and control over the Internet. Liu, who sits on the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee which is the apex of power in China, praised Facebook's technology and management methods, Xinhua said. Zuckerberg was in Beijing for the China Development Forum, a government-sponsored conference bringing together top business executives and the country's ruling elite. China \"hopes (Facebook) can strengthen exchanges, share experiences and improve mutual understanding with China's Internet companies\", Xinhua quoted Liu as telling Zuckerberg. On Friday, Zuckerberg posted an image of himself running through smog in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, past the portrait of the late Chairman Mao Zedong hanging over the Forbidden City. The 31-year-old has achieved celebrity status in China, one of the few markets where Facebook and other foreign Internet platforms, including Alphabet Inc's Google services and Twitter Inc, are not available due to tight government controls. He has long sought to improve his company's relationship with the Chinese authorities, and now sits on the advisory board of the School of Economics and Management at China's elite Tsinghua University.Google Puts Boston Dynamics Up for Sale in Robotics Retreat: Executives at Google parent Alphabet Inc., absorbed with making sure all the various companies under its corporate umbrella have plans to generate real revenue, concluded that Boston Dynamics isn’t likely to produce a marketable product in the next few years and have put the unit up for sale, according to two people familiar with the company’s plans. Possible acquirers include the Toyota Research Institute, a division of Toyota Motor Corp., and Amazon.com Inc., which makes robots for its fulfillment centers, according to one person. Google and Toyota declined to comment, and Amazon didn’t respond to requests for comment. Google acquired Boston Dynamics in late 2013 as part of a spree of acquisitions in the field of robotics. The deals were spearheaded by Andy Rubin, former chief of the Android division, and brought about 300 robotics engineers into Google. Rubin left the company in October 2014. Over the following year, the robot initiative, dubbed Replicant, was plagued by leadership changes, failures to collaborate between companies and an unsuccessful effort to recruit a new leader. At the heart of Replicant’s trouble, said a person familiar with the group, was a reluctance by Boston Dynamics executives to work with Google’s other robot engineers in California and Tokyo and the unit’s failure to come up with products that could be released in the near term. Tensions between Boston Dynamics and the rest of the Replicant group spilled into open view within Google, when written minutes of a Nov. 11 meeting and several subsequent e-mails were inadvertently published to an online forum that was accessible to other Google workers. These documents were made available to Bloomberg News by a Google employee who spotted them. The November meeting was run by Jonathan Rosenberg, an adviser to Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page and former Google senior vice president, who was temporarily in charge of the Replicant group. In the meeting, Rosenberg said, “we as a startup of our size cannot spend 30-plus percent of our resources on things that take ten years,\" and that \"there’s some time frame that we need to be generating an amount of revenue that covers expenses and (that) needs to be a few years.\"Alibaba is working to bring virtual reality into its e-commerce services: Alibaba has formally thrown its hat into the virtual reality ring after the Chinese e-commerce giant announced its own VR research lab, dubbed GnomeMagic Lab. The company invested in red hot augmented reality company Magic Leap earlier this year, in a deal that put Alibaba vice chairman Joe Tsai on the board, and it has tinkered with 360 degree panoramic video for Youku Tudou — the Chinese video site it invested in and is in the process of acquiring for $3.5 billion — but this is its official entry into the space. Alibaba, which claims 400 million users across its services, said that GnomeMagic Lab will work with its shopping businesses with a view to integrating VR into the shopping experience while exploring other applications, such as video with Youku Tudou and entertainment via Alibaba Pictures. In a press announcement, former Facebook engineer Zhao Haiping, who is on the Alibaba’s GnomeMagic Lab team, said VR could enable customers to shop virtually on New York’s Fifth Avenue from the comfort of their own home. On a more practical level, Alibaba wants to help merchants use VR to sell on its sites, it said it has already created VR visuals for hundreds of products. That’s the plan for where Alibaba believes that VR is going, or could go, in the longer term. For now, the company is setting up a store dedicated to VR hardware to help companies tap into its vast audience.VR is the hot topic of the moment, and it’s more a case of which tech companies aren’t getting into it. Samsung has already shipped a headset. Facebook bought Occulus, which is about to launch its Rift VR and an initial 30 games. HTC’s is arriving imminently and Sony’s effort is also on its way. On the content side, Facebook, YouTube and — today — even British broadcaster Sky are opening themselves up to the virtual future.Why students are throwing tons of money at a program that won’t give them a college degree: One of the biggest booms in the job market right now: an influx of coders graduating from three- to six-month coding crunch programs in lieu of traditional four-year Computer Science degree programs. These for-profit programs, non-accredited and operating without much regulation, have been cropping up in response to a swelling market demand for STEM workers. They vary in quality, but most bootcamps promise steady, high-paying work upon graduation, prompting aspiring coders to invest anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 of personal money to enroll. Now, colleges and universities are teaming up with these private schools, or rolling out their own bootcamp-style programs to offer accelerated coding workshops to their students. Northeastern, UPenn, and Rutgers have announced in-house bootcamps in the couple of months, while Lynn University and Concordia University have paired with programs like General Assembly and The Software Craftsmanship Guild. It’s a response to thetremendous growth in bootcamp enrollment, which increased by 138 percent from 2014 to 2015, compared to more modest growth in traditional Computer Science degrees (14 percent from 2013 to 2014). The demand is clear. But should universities be borrowing bootcamp tactics? O’Neill, who is Principal Architect at Monetate, agrees. He’s skeptical of bootcamper applicants and is more inclined to hire four-year CS degree graduates, especially for the most in-demand positions: “full stack” developers who possess a range of coding skills. He compares the skillsets of bootcampers to performing auto repair on a car, versus the kind of large-scale, architectural skills of your standard CS degree holder, who can do everything from small repairs to making deep structural changes. “You emerge from a bootcamp fit to do an oil change, but not design a car,” he said. A typical four-year CS degree will require students to study theoretical principles of programming on top of straight coding skills. Bootcamps, on the other hand, focus on programming alone, with an emphasis on in-demand languages in popular sectors like app development, functioning more like vocational school. But Anupam Joshi sees the immediate benefits of these programs. He’s Chair of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, which doesn’t currently have plans to incorporate bootcamp style programs into its CS department (though the university does have a “training center” that offers vocational services, including coding). But he appreciates the bootcamps' quick adaptability to industry fads and the wider scope of needs they fill amidst the student body. “Bootcamps are good for someone who wants to get an entry level job,” he said of the promotion of coding over theory. “It’s like every other trade.”Blackstone nears $940 million deal to buy HP Enterprise stake in India's MphasiS: sources Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) is nearing a deal to acquire Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) (HPE.N) controlling stake worth about $940 million in Indian IT outsourcing services provider MphasiS Ltd (MBFL.NS), according to three sources directly involved in the deal. HPE owns roughly 60.5 percent stake in MphasiS, and the U.S.-based parent had been looking to exit from the Indian venture to shore up its capital. Bids for buying the MphasiS stake were submitted earlier this month and the U.S. private equity firm has emerged as the front-runner for taking majority ownership of the mid-sized Indian IT services exporter, the sources said. Financial details of the possible deal were not immediately known. Based on MphasiS' stock price on Thursday, the HPE stake in the Bengaluru-headquartered company is valued at about $940 million. The company's total market value is about $1.6 billion.Flipkart and Amazon may have explored sale talks, say sources: Flipkart reportedly considered selling itself to Amazon, upending the notion that India’s largest online retailer would go full distance as an independent Internet giant. half-a-dozen sources told ET of the discussions between Flipkart and Amazon, and emphasised there is no reason to believe that a deal will be struck or that talks are still ongoing between the two. The talks were held until as recently as the last quarter of 2015, one of the sources said. ET was not able to determine the exact timeline of these talks or if they were initiated by one of Flipkart's investors. Flipkart itself denied that it is up for sale, or that it is in the market for capital. Three of the sources, who are top-level executives in venture capital and private equity firms, said Amazon made a preliminary offer of up to $8 billion to acquire Flipkart, nearly half of its previous stated valuation of $15.2 billion. A mutual fund managed by Morgan Stanley slashed the value of its Flipkart shares by 27% last month to about $11 billion, increasing speculation that new investors will back the company at a lower valuation. Flipkart-Amazon talks went cold after the offer was perceived to be too low, but the sources said the situation can change given Alibaba's interest in Flipkart.What AlphaGo’s sly move says about machine creativity: AlphaGo, the computer system Google engineers trained to master the ancient game of Go, needed only one move to make it abundantly clear that it has left humans in its dust. The move came Thursday, in the second game of AlphaGo’s 4-1 landmark victory over South Korean Lee Sedol, one of the world’s best Go players. About an hour into the match, AlphaGo placed one of its stones in a nontraditional spot on the board that surprised those watching. “I don’t really know if it’s a good or bad move,” said Michael Redmond, a commentator on a live English broadcast. “It’s a very strange move.” Redmond, one of the Western world’s best Go players, could only crack a smile. “I thought it was a mistake,” his broadcast partner, Chris Garlock, said with a laugh. Sedol, however, was more serious. He stared at the board, then got up from the table and left the room. As Sedol returned after a few minutes and pondered his next move, it became clear that AlphaGo’s move was no mistake. It might be strange, but it definitely wasn’t bad. It was brilliant.  Sedol would take almost 16 minutes to make his next move. He would never recover, losing the match. “Almost no human pro would’ve thought of it, I think,” Redmond said after the match. Pedro Domingos, a computer science professor at the University of Washington and author of “The Master Algorithm,” saw a parallel between AlphaGo’s style and how chess prodigy Bobby Fischer was feared because his early moves were considered too foolish to even be made. But as Fischer’s matches wore on, the ill-advised moves suddenly looked genius. “If that’s not creative, then what is?” Domingos asked. He sees machines delivering creative results, and they’re just getting started. Domingos believes a computer eventually will write a best-selling book. And he thinks there’s a 50-50 chance that a computer writes a hit pop song in the next decade, given advances in artificial intelligence techniques and computing power.Domingos said such advances shouldn’t come as a surprise, as machines increasingly demonstrate that creativity isn’t magical and distinctly human.Apple looks to Google’s Cloud Platform as it diversifies its infrastructure: Rumors are flying today that Apple is moving part of its cloud business from AWS to Google’s Cloud Platform. We did some asking around and yes, it does appear that Apple has made some moves to diversify its iCloud storage, tapping Google for some of that business. This is another huge win for Google and a — at the very least perceived — loss of ground for AWS, which has watched as Dropbox moved large parts of its US storage business in-house and Spotify moved at least part of its business to Google, too. If you’re keeping score, it’s been a good month for Google and especially the new head of its cloud business Diane Greene. High profile clients like Spotify and Apple would certainly make it more attractive to other enterprise customers. Google’s Cloud Platform may have the power of Google’s data center technology behind it, but that hasn’t yet helped the company in competing against AWS and Microsoft’s Azure platform. AWS has the advantage of an early start and Azure profits from Microsoft’s existing sales channels and it’s focus on hybrid cloud technologies. And even with the power of Microsoft behind it, though, Azure remains a distant second in the cloud business. One industry insider who chose not to be identified, however, told TechCrunch that Apple was definitely exploring its options around public cloud vendors, looking at Microsoft Azure and Google, but it had not made any firm decisions yet. It’s worth noting that Apple already uses  Azure (and AWS) for iCloud services and media serving. Whether Apple will continue moving off of AWS and onto other platforms is anyone’s guess. But at the moment it appears that this is a matter of diversifying its portfolio of cloud suppliers. Another wrinkle here is that Apple is currently expanding its data center in Prineville, Oregon, and is also expected to invest heavily in new data centers in both the U.S. and Europe. If that’s the case, moving from AWS to Google, then Google to Prineville wouldn’t seem to make sense. Why not just wait until the data center construction is complete?If Apple is indeed simply looking to diversify its infrastructure, though, then adding Google (on top of Azure, AWS and its own data centers) would be a fairly logical move. It’s also possible that Apple is only looking at some very specific services on the Google cloud, with theBigQuery data analytics platform being the prime suspect here.Morgan Stanley Downgrades LinkedIn, Slashes Price Target by 34 Percent: Why we were wrong\" isn't a phrase one might want to include when sending out a note to clients, but it's what Morgan Stanley analysts were forced to deploy on Wednesday morning as they downgraded LinkedIn Corp. The shift from \"overweight' to \"equalweight,\" is the latest in a series of cuts for LinkedIn after it reported lackluster earnings last month that sent shares tumbling by more than 40 percent the following day.  \"With its current product offering, LinkedIn isn't likely to be as big of a platform as we previously thought,\" the team, led by Brian Nowak, said. \"We are reducing our price target to $125 [per] share (from $190) as well, driven by our lower long-term cash flow forecasts and increased execution uncertainty.\" Two key factors that had kept Morgan Stanley bullish are now abating. The first was growth in LinkedIn's Talent Solutions segment, which includes such things as subscription revenue. Nowak and his team now believe that growth has slowed both domestically and internationally for this segment and that the increased focus on small- and medium-sized businesses betokens that LinkedIn is hitting a peak when it comes to larger companies. The second was the monetization potential in new segments, known as Lynda and Sales Navigator. Recent events have caused the team to grow skeptical.Beyond Swipe Right: The Pickup Line Gets a Makeover: Thanks to the popular dating app Tinder, a one-size-fits-all gesture of approval, swipe right, has in theory replaced awkward fumbles at an opening conversational gambit. But in fact, the migration of courtship online has resulted in a refinement of pickup lines far beyond ’70s singles-bar relics like “Hey baby, what’s your sign?” and “Are those space pants? Because your butt is out of this world.” The simple “Hi” and its variations are the surest ways to end a conversation; they’re too generic and, lately, indistinguishable from the way bots initiate contact. Only those with the most flattering profile pictures can get away with generic questions like “How was your weekend?” A more common approach in Tinder-land is to quickly skim the other person’s profile and find something to comment on — a detail from a photo, or a line of profile text. Statements tend to work better than questions as conversation starters; they’re less personal and invite reactions and commentary rather than disclosure. With the help of a friend, Brent Bailey, 24, a programmer in New York, came up with a successful opener to someone who mentioned her life being “a bit messy” in her profile. “I could make your life a whole lot messier,” he responded. Mr. Bailey said he was more successful with crowd-sourced pickup lines. “As a rule, my friends are way less concerned about my dignity, so they usually come up with something way more interesting than I would,” he said. On the dating service Bumble, where women must initiate all conversations, Ms. Smothers decided to try what she called a “dumb troll-y” gimmick — asking every match if he was a feminist. Men loved it, and she got a high response rate she has yet to match.LivingSocial is laying off more than half of its workers: LivingSocial will cut more than half of its workforce, according to anannouncement from the company saying it has completed its \"initial phase of turnaround.\" The move is the latest sign of the decline of \"daily deal\" sites once thought of as the next big thing for online shopping. The sites typically offered users heavily discounted vouchers at local businesses in exchange for a cut of deal sales. But some business complained that the model wasn't actually a good deal for them -- and consumers seemed to tire of the flood of emails sent by the services. The latest job cuts are part of a series of layoffs. The local company cut 400 jobs in 2014 and another 200 in October of last year. Competitor Groupon has also struggled: In September it announced it would lay off 1,100 people -- roughly 10 percent of its workforce -- and close operations in six countries. LivingSocial plans to move away from the voucher business, but hopes to expand \"card-linked\" discounts, according to the press release. The company is trying out a program called Restaurant Plus in handful of cities that works by letting customers reserve a deal with payment card information on file, but not charging them for it until it's actually used.Sony PlayStation VR to launch globally in October, cost $399: Sony Corp announced on Tuesday that its virtual reality headset for PlayStation will launch globally in October for $399, a move that undercuts its biggest competitor by hundreds of dollars. Andrew House, head of Sony's gaming division, made the announcement during a press event at the Video Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where virtual reality gaming counterpart Oculus Rift announced its headset a day earlier. The headset, a visor-style frame with a 5.7 inch (14.5 centimeters) screen, includes 360 degree head tracking, a 100 degree field of vision and latency of 18 milliseconds between the time a user's head moves and the time they see the correct image. At $399,the package is notably less than the $599 price announced Monday by Facebook-owned virtual reality company Oculus Rift. Oculus will also sell bundles that include an Oculus Ready PC and a Rift for preorder in February starting at $1,499. The company said more than 230 developers are building content for the PlayStation VR device and 50 games are expected to be ready by the launch date. Users can download the Playroom VR at the PlayStation store and play six free games. The company has also teamed up with development company EA Sports and Lucasfilm for a Star Wars Battlefront game that will be released as a PlayStation VR exclusive.Uber Could Give Us a Lesson in Productivity: In Los Angeles, traditional taxi drivers have a passenger in the car for 40.7 percent of the miles they drive. By contrast, Uber drivers have a passenger in the car for 64.2 percent of their miles, or a 58 percent higher capacity utilization rate. In Seattle, the other city surveyed with mileage data, Uber drivers were 41 percent more productive. When measured by time, Uber drivers in Boston, San Francisco and New York on average have a passenger in their car about half the time their smartphone app is turned on. That compares to a range of 32 percent of the shift for taxi drivers in Boston to 49.5 percent for cabbies in New York. The service's use of internet-based mobile technology to connect passengers and drivers certainly contributes to its efficiency, according to the report. It makes sense: tapping your smartphone screen a few minutes before you need a ride is often easier than waiting on a street corner and hoping an empty cab drives past. Meanwhile Uber allows drivers to set their own shifts, and when combined with their use of so-called surge pricing that increases fares during times of increased ridership, supply and demand are more smoothly matched. Uber drivers are also exempt from regulations that prevent taxi drivers who drop off a passenger in a jurisdiction outside the one that granted their occupational license from picking up another customer in the same location. Given their 38 percent advantage, Uber drivers could charge 28 percent less than traditional taxis and still earn the same amount per hour under certain assumptions, including ignoring fixed costs, according to Cramer and Krueger. That may be one reason investors last year valued the company at $62.5 billion, more than Ford Motor Co.,  General Motors Co., and 80 percent of companies in the S&P 500.Uber India Is Working on Offering Ride-Booking on Snapdeal: Uber’s India arm is in talks to partner with Indian e-commerce platform Snapdeal, multiple sources told Re/code. If a deal is reached, Snapdeal shoppers in India would be able to hail an Uber from within the newest iteration of Snapdeal’s app, these people said. As of March 9, Snapdeal had only released its new app to a select group of its customers, but indicated in a company blog post it would soon roll out to a larger group of users. The newest version of the Snapdeal app already includes integrations with travel booking service Cleartrip, food-delivery service Zomato and bus-booking service Redbus. As Snapdeal CEO Kunal Bahl told Re/code last April, the company believes it can differentiate from e-commerce competitors Flipkart and Amazon by broadening its focus beyond selling physical retail products. Last year, Snapdeal acquired FreeCharge, a recharge service for prepaid phones, and RupeePower, a comparison site for credit cards and loans. “What’s the delta between retail and consumption?” Bahl asked rhetorically. “It’s things like financial services, education, utilities, health care. But today, all everyone is doing is products.”India Opens Market for Solar Battery Makers Such as Tesla: India plans for the first time to include energy storage as a requirement when a solar project is tendered this month, opening what could become a significant new market to battery makers such as Tesla Motors Inc., Samsung SDI Co. and Panasonic Corp. The state-owned Solar Energy Corp. of India, which is responsible for implementing the government’s green targets, will ask bidders to include a storage component in 100 megawatts of the 750 megawatts of solar capacity tendered in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, Managing Director Ashvini Kumar said in an interview. The intention of the pilot program is to reduce fluctuations in electricity supply in order to make possible the transfer of clean energy between states. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a goal of 175 gigawatts of clean energy by 2022. The Andhra Pradesh project include 15 minutes of storage each for two solar installations. Warehousing power is considered a crucial component of India’s green targets. The requirement, if more broadly adopted, has the potential to invigorate the storage market because of India’s outsized ambitions for the industry. It would give manufacturers the scale they need to help bring down costs of battery storage that are holding back wider adoption.Wall Street Tours the Tesla Factory—and Loves What It Sees: Wall Street analysts have been touring Tesla’s massive factory in Fremont, Calif., and they're returning with the same conclusion: Elon Musk's electric-vehicle company is getting ready for something big. In a sign of this enthusiasm, Robert W. Baird & Co. upgraded its Tesla rating on Monday morning following a factory tour. Last week, Stifel analysts returned from their fourth visit in four years to Tesla’s flagship factory in Fremont. “In roughly one year since our last visit,” wrote analyst James Albertine, “the progress witnessed is truly stunning.\"  Tesla shares have jumped 45 percent in the past month as Musk, the chief executive, sought to reassure investors that the company is still on track after the challenging and much-delayed launch of the Model X luxury SUV.  Stifel and Credit Suisse both noted Tesla's new aluminum stamping press, which Credit Suisse's Galves says has 10 to 20 times the output of  Tesla's older machine. The bodies of the Model S and Model X are both made of aluminum, which costs twice as much as steel but weighs less. Tesla hasn't yet disclosed the composition of the Model 3. Keeping the weight down on electric vehicles helps achieve the maximum range on the battery, but maintaining a balance between cost and performance is crucial for a mass-market plug-in car. Tesla has built a new state-of-the-art paint shop that's capable of scaling up to 500,000 cars a year. That happens to be Tesla's production forecast for 2020, a 10-fold increase from last year's sales. If Tesla is to achieve that lofty goal, paint jobs won't be a holdup.What New Delhi’s free clinics can teach America about fixing its broken health care system: Rupandeep Kaur, 20 weeks pregnant, arrived at a medical clinic looking fatigued and ready to collapse. After being asked her name and address, she was taken to see a physician who reviewed her medical history, asked several questions, and ordered a series of tests including blood and urine. These tests revealed that her fetus was healthy but Kaur had dangerously low hemoglobin and blood pressure levels. The physician, Alka Choudhry, ordered an ambulance to take her to a nearby hospital. All of this, including the medical tests, happened in 15 minutes at the Peeragarhi Relief Camp in New Delhi, India. The entire process was automated — from check-in, to retrieval of medical records, to testing and analysis and ambulance dispatch. The hospital also received Kaur’s medical records electronically. There was no paperwork filled out, no bills sent to the patient or insurance company, no delay of any kind. Yes, it was all free. The hospital treated Kaur for mineral and protein deficiencies and released her the same day. Had she not received timely treatment, she may have had a miscarriage or lost her life. The technology that made the instant diagnosis possible at Peeragarhi was medical device called the Swasthya Slate. This $600 device, the size of a cake tin, performs 33 common medical tests including blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, blood haemoglobin, urine protein and glucose. And it tests for diseases such as malaria, dengue, hepatitis, HIV, and typhoid. Each test only takes a minute or two and the device uploads its data to a cloud-based medical-record management system that can be accessed by the patient. The Swasthya Slate was developed by Kanav Kahol, who was a biomedical engineer and researcher at Arizona State University’s department of biomedical informatics until he became frustrated at the lack of interest by the medical establishment in reducing the cost of diagnostic testing. He worried that billions of people were getting no medical care or substandard care because of the medical industry’s motivation in keeping prices high. In 2011, he returned home to New Delhi to develop a solution. By Jan. 2013, Kahol had built the Swasthya Slate and persuaded the state of Jammu and Kashmir, in Northern India, to allow its use in six underserved districts with a population of 2.1 million people. The device is now in use at 498 clinics there. Focusing on reproductive maternal and child health, the system has been used to provide antenatal care to more than 22,000 mothers. Of these, 277 mothers were diagnosed as high risk and provided timely care. Mothers are getting care in their villages now instead of having to travel to clinics in cities. A newer version of the Slate, called HealthCube, was tested last month by nine teams of physicians and technology, operations, and marketing experts at Peru’s leading hospital, Clinica Internacional. They tested its accuracy against the western equipment that they use, its durability in emergency room and clinical settings, the ability of minimally trained clinicians to use it in rural settings, and its acceptability to patients. Clinica’s general manager, Alvaro Chavez Tori, told me in an email that the tests were highly successful and “acceptance of the technology was amazingly high.” He sees this technology as a way of helping the millions of people in Peru and Latin America who lack access to quality diagnostics.Infibeam turns profitable; to open first IPO by an Indian e-com venture on March 21: The parent of horizontal e-commerce platform Infibeam and e-commerce enabler BuildaBazaar, is to hit the market with its initial public offer (IPO) on March 21. This would make it the first among peers, including those several times bigger, to go public. Infibeam had received a green signal from securities market regulator SEBI for its initial public offering (IPO) to raise up to Rs 450 crore last October.  Founded in 2010 by a former Amazon executive, Vishal Mehta, Infibeam would also become one of the youngest firms to list on a national bourse. Having restricted itself from raising private capital, unlike its peers, it did not get too aggressive in customer acquisition to drive the B2C business and has been especially pushing the B2B e-commerce enabler platform BuildaBazaar. Infibeam would be the first pure-play e-commerce firm in the country to float an IPO in India and would test the general investors’ appetite for the sector. E-commerce in India has absorbed billions of dollars over the past four years, much of it from foreign private equity and venture capital firms. Infibeam happens to be an exception as it has not approached any major private investor for funds till now. It is promoted by a Gujarat-based affluent family whose business interest straddles a dealership for Toyota cars. Interestingly, Infibeam made profit in the first six months of the current financial year. It reported net revenues of Rs 171.27 crore for the April-September 2015 period with EBITDA of close to Rs 15 crore and net profit (adjusted for prior period items) of Rs 6.5 crore. It had clocked net loss of just under Rs 10 crore for 2014-15. As of December 31, 2015, it had 48,724 registered merchants on the BuildaBazaar platform. In Infibeam.com e-retail site, in addition to direct sales procured from suppliers, it had more than 5,000 registered merchants, and claimed to have more than 7.8 million active users (based on last login in the immediately preceding 12 months). To its credit, it is one of the rare horizontal e-commerce platforms to have survived without large external funding. Others like IndiaPlaza shut down as they failed to get follow-on funding, and as a consequence, investors funding got concentrated to the troika of Flipkart, Snapdeal and ShopClues. Global e-commerce behemoth Amazon itself has built a big presence in India and is among the top three ventures in the country. Infibeam’s only external equity funding has come from media house Bennett, Coleman & Co Ltd, which bet around Rs 33.3 crore through the ad-for-equity investment platform Brand Equity Treaties Ltd (BETL). BETL owns a 1.8 per cent stake in the firm. BETL also pitched in with Rs 2 crore of non-convertible debentures, which are outstanding.Modeled After Ants, Team of Just Six Tiny Robots Can Move 2-Ton Car: Archimedes pointed out that with a lever he could move the world. He most likely would have been surprised to learn that a team of six microrobots, weighing just 3.5 ounces in total, could pull a car weighing 3,900 pounds. A group of researchers at the Biomimetics and Dexterous Manipulation Laboratory at Stanford University has been exploring the limits of friction in the design of tiny robots that have the ability to pull thousands of times their weight, wander like gecko lizards on vertical surfaces or mimic bats. Now they have pushed biomimicry in a new direction. They have taken their inspiration from tiny ants that work as teams to move massive objects. In this case, they are not just taking ideas from nature — the movie “Big Hero 6” made a great deal of what swarms of microrobots could do, including tossing cars. The researchers’ approach is counterintuitive. Rather than striking powerful blows like a football player making a tackle or a jackhammer, they have focused on synchronizing the smooth application of very tiny forces. The microrobots work in concert, if slowly. The researchers observed that the ants get great cooperative force by each using three of their six legs simultaneously. Their new demonstration is the functional equivalent of a team of six humans moving a weight equivalent to that of an Eiffel Tower and three Statues of Liberty, Mr. Christensen said. The car is the one he uses for commuting to campus. Part of the magic is the use of a special adhesive that was inspired by gecko toes. India's Micromax, once a rising star, struggles: A year ago, Micromax vaulted past Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to become India's leading smartphone brand. Today, its market share has nearly halved, several top executives have resigned, and the company is looking for growth outside India. In Micromax's slide to second place is a tale of the promise and peril of India's booming but hyper-competitive smartphone industry. India is the world's fastest-growing smartphone market. Shipments of smartphones jumped 29 percent to 103 million units last year. Rapid growth has helped nurture a crop of local brands, led by Micromax, that outsourced production to Chinese manufacturers. Now, as Samsung rolls out more affordable phones, the same Chinese factories are entering the Indian market with their own brands, depressing prices and forcing Indian mobile makers to rethink their strategies. \"What the Indian brands did to the global brands two years ago, Chinese phone makers are doing the same to Indian brands now, and over the next year we see tremendous competition for Micromax and other Indian smartphone makers,\" said Tarun Pathak, analyst at Counterpoint Research in New Delhi. Micromax, which was founded in New Delhi by four partners in 2000 but only began selling mobile phones in 2008, built its market share by working with Chinese manufacturers such as Coolpad, Gionee and Oppo to offer affordable phones quickly. In 2015, it launched more than 40 new models. In 2014, the founders brought in outside managers to lead the company at a time when Micromax was challenging Samsung to become the largest mobile phone maker in India. But tensions arose soon after between founders and the newly hired executives, six former executives told Reuters. These conflicts undermined Micromax's attempts to raise funds for expansion, say former executives. Last May, Alibaba walked away from a mooted $1.2 billion purchase of a 20 percent stake, citing a lack of clarity on growth plans, according to one executive involved in the discussion. Former executives said the lack of fresh funding undermined a proposal by the new executives to move Micromax's research and design operations, which had previously been outsourced, in-house. The move was intended to help Micromax differentiate itself from generic Android clones. \"We hired about 80-90 people in Bangalore to do in-house software and design, but with no money from the investors and little interest from the founders, that team fizzled away and that office has been partially shut down now,\" said a former executive. After Alibaba walked away, Micromax struggled to attract other investors who would have been key to Micromax's plan to invest in software R&D and hardware design. The company was forced to scale down the in-house R&D project, a top executive involved in the fundraising plan said. Meanwhile, Chinese handset makers, including Coolpad and Oppo, to which Micromax outsources its manufacturing, were sharpening their focus on India. Samsung, too, began to introduce more affordable models there. In 2015, Chinese brands doubled their market share to 18 percent, according to Counterpoint Research, taking away business from Indian budget phone makers such as Micromax, Intex, Lava and Karbonn. Indian brands' market share fell from 48 to 43 percent last year.How a simple typo helped stop a $1 billion digital bank heist: It was just a few letters off: Someone misspelled \"foundation\" as \"fandation\" on an online payment transfer request. But that simple typo helped stop hackers from getting away with a nearly $1 billion digital heist last month, Reuters reports. Hackers broke into the Bangladeshi central bank's computer systems, according to anonymous officials at the financial institution cited by Reuters, stealing the credentials needed to authorize payment transfers. The attackers used the stolen information to ask the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to make massive money transfers -- nearly three dozen of them -- from the Bangladeshi bank's account with the Fed to accounts at other financial institutions overseas. Four transfers to accounts in the Philippines, totaling abut $80 million, worked. But then a fifth request, for $20 million to be sent to an apparently fictitious Sri Lankan nonprofit, was flagged as suspicious by a routing bank due to the \"fandation\" error. The Bangladesh central bank was able to stop that transaction after the routing bank asked for confirmation. \"The Sri Lankan bank did not disburse it immediately, and we could recover the full amount,\" the central bank told the Financial Times. The requests waiting to be processed -- amounting to a total of between $850 million and $870 million, according to an unnamed official cited by Reuters -- were also halted. So if it weren't for that typo, the attackers may have escaped with an even bigger payday. Bangladesh's finance minister has blamed the incident on the Federal Reserve and said his government will \"file a case in the international court against\" the financial institution, according to local outlet the Dhaka Tribune. A New York Fed spokesperson denied the accusation, telling The Washington Post in a statement that \"there is no evidence of any attempt to penetrate Federal Reserve systems in connection with the payments in question\" or that the institution's systems were compromised. According to the spokesperson, the payment instructions were \"fully authenticated\" using standard methods.Top Start-Up Investors Are Betting on Growth, Not Waiting for It: For the last few years, the spotlight in start-up investing has largely shone on those who poured money into a company when it was already well along on a growth path. It turns out that spotlight may have been misdirected. While some investors are throwing giant sums into more mature start-ups like Uber and Airbnb at soaring valuations, it is the venture capitalists who identify a promising company at its infancy and bet on its growth who often come out on top. Known as early-stage investors, they dominate a list of the top 20 venture capitalists worldwide that was recently created by the research firm CB Insights. About three-quarters of the top 20 are investors who put money into start-ups during their early rounds of financing. Only a handful on the list are focused on investing at a later stage in a company’s life. Early-stage investments have accounted for the lion’s share of the venture industry’s gains since 1994, according to Cambridge Associates, a research firm that studied the quarterly financial reports of dozens of venture firms. Since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, between two-thirds and three-quarters of the industry’s returns have been generated by early-stage investments in any given year. But the value of investing in a company when it is still nascent has been somewhat obscured in recent years as hordes of nontraditional start-up investors — including mutual funds, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds — have piled into private tech companies, often when those start-ups are already proven growth stories. When Uber raised around $2.1 billion in December, for example, one of its investors was Tiger Global Management, a New York investment firm with a hedge fund component. Rebecca Lynn, a managing director and co-founder of Canvas Ventures who is on the CB Insights list, said early-stage investments generally pay off more because “investors can get more of an ownership stake and you’re also part of the team.” Ms. Lynn, who invested early in the alternative lending platform Lending Club, which went public in 2014, added that “later-stage investing is more like a stock bet. You’re along for the ride.”Instacart Gets Red Bull and Doritos to Pay Your Delivery Fees: Online shoppers hate paying delivery fees. So Instacart Inc. is getting Pepsi to foot the bill. The grocery delivery startup is working with General Mills Inc., Nestlé SA, PepsiCo Inc., Unilever NV, and other consumer goods makers to cover the cost of delivery or provide other discounts when customers buy their products. In addition to the coupons, the companies pay Instacart to advertise on its website. Since introducing the program about six months ago, it now accounts for 15 percent of Instacart’s revenue, said Apoorva Mehta, the company’s chief executive officer. Shoppers can find discounts when filling up their carts with brands such as Degree, Doritos, DiGiorno, Häagen-Dazs, Quaker Oats, and Stella Artois. Instacart ads promise free delivery if you spend $10 on Red Bull, or consumers can get 75 cents off any Dove soap. Mehta compares the ads to those offered on the side of Google search results. “It’s like AdWords for groceries,” he said. In its quest to build a profitable business, Instacart is searching for new sources of revenue that won’t turn off shoppers. The company, which was valued at $2 billion by investors last year, had previously made up some of its costs by selling products for more than what the grocery stores charged. Customers complained, and Instacart backtracked. The company recently cut pay for some workers, according to reports this week in Quartz and Re/code. Instacart said it costs much more to deliver an order than the $5.99 it charges shoppers, but customers are unwilling to pay more.TechCrunch Sources: India’s Flipkart in talks to raise up to $1b, likely in a down round: After years of raising hundreds of millions of dollars to tap into the burgeoning e-commerce market in India, one of the country’s biggest tech companies is facing a markdown in its valuation as it aims to pick up yet more investment. TechCrunch has learned from sources that Flipkart is looking to raise up to $1 billion in funding to grow its business and shore up against competition from local rival Snapdeal and global giant Amazon. “The funding is now delayed and should take another 3-4 months. A downround is certain,” said a source. According to our sources, one potential investor is Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. The company — already a backer of rival Snapdeal — reportedly met with Flipkart management in Hong Kong to discuss investing at less than $10 billion. Other sources say a round would not be this low, and more likely in the range of $11 billion to $14 billion. Alibaba’s alleged interest in Flipkart has been reported previously. Another investor that has been eyeing up a stake in Flipkart is the Fosun Group, sometimes referred to as the Berkshire Hathaway of China. It’s not clear what valuation Fosun has discussed with Flipkart.Salesforce Expands Machine-Learning Service to Microsoft Outlook: Salesforce.com Inc. is taking another step forward in its partnership with Microsoft Corp., expanding integration with the Outlook e-mail program to help sales representatives streamline tasks such as scheduling meetings and responding to messages. With the new SalesforceIQ Inbox for Outlook application, Salesforce is folding its predictive technology into an e-mail service that has more than 400 million users. The app will let executives work directly from within Outlook on their desktop computers, boosting productivity by automating key steps while interacting with their customers. E-mail continues to be a crucial tool used by sales representatives when they’re trying to land a deal, said Steve Loughlin, chief executive officer of the SalesforceIQ unit. “There are all these data sources that sales reps are trying to access -- they’re drowning in the information,\" Loughlin said. \"This is a way to pull it all together into a single place and deliver it where they are working.\" Salesforce is extending the reach of machine-learning technology after acquiring RelateIQ for $390 million in 2014. With Inbox, predictive tools are folded into Outlook to erase manual steps. For example, the program can juggle potential meeting times inside e-mails -- automatically adjusting open calendar spots as they fill up before e-mails are returned. The cooperation between San Francisco-based Salesforce and Microsoft broadens the companies’ growing partnership. About two years ago, the two agreed to make some of their business-software products work better together, signaling a thaw in relations between the longtime rivals. “A large number of Salesforce’s large customers are on Outlook,” Loughlin said. \"This is going to be a huge opportunity.\"Master of Go Board Game Is Walloped by Google Computer Program: A Google computer program stunned one of the world’s top players on Wednesday in a round of Go, which is believed to be the most complex board game ever created. The match — between Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo and the South Korean Go master Lee Se-dol — was viewed as an important test of how far research into artificial intelligence has come in its quest to create machines smarter than humans. Go is a two-player game of strategy said to have originated in China 3,000 years ago. Players compete to win more territory by placing black and white “stones” on a grid measuring 19 squares by 19 squares. The play is more complex than chess, with a far greater possible sequence of moves, and requires superlative instincts and evaluation skills. Because of that, many researchers believed that mastery of the game by a computer was still a decade away. Before the match, Mr. Lee said he could win 5-0 or 4-1, predicting that computing power alone could not win a Go match. Victory takes “human intuition,” something AlphaGo has not yet mastered, he said. But after reading more about the program he became less upbeat, saying that AlphaGo appeared able to imitate human intuition to a certain degree and predicting that artificial intelligence would eventually surpass humans in Go. AlphaGo posed Mr. Lee a unique challenge. In a human-versus-human Go match, which typically lasts several hours, the players “feel” each other and evaluate styles and psychologies, he said. “This time, it’s like playing the game alone,” Mr. Lee said on the eve of the match. “There are mistakes humans make because they are humans. If that happens to me, I can lose a match.” Kim Sung-ryong, a South Korean Go master who provided commentary during Wednesday’s match, said that AlphaGo made a clear mistake early on, but that unlike most human players, it did not lose its “cool.” “It didn’t play Go as a human does,” he said. “It was a Go match with human emotional elements carved out.” Mr. Lee said he knew he had lost the match after AlphaGo made a move so unexpected and unconventional that he thought “it was impossible to make such a move.”Shared Office Startup WeWork Raises Funds at $16 Billion Valuation for Asia Expansion:  WeWork Cos., a New York-based shared-office startup, raised $430 million from Chinese investors as it prepares to expand throughout Asia. Investors valued the company at $16 billion as part of the financing round, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the terms were private. Chinese investment firms Legend Holdings and Hony Capital led the round, WeWork said. The real estate startup's website lists China, Hong Kong, India, and Seoul among the places where it will offer service \"soon.\" John Zhao, the chief executive officer at Hony Capital, said in a statement that WeWork's \"fit for the Chinese culture is unparalleled.\" WeWork has about 50,000 members globally, who rent desks and offices in shared spaces operated by the company in 21 cities. Memberships start at $45 a month, and the company is also exploring residential rentals. WeWork is in talks with an Australian developer about forming a global venture to lease offices and living spaces to other companies, Bloomberg reported last week. Corporate documents filed Tuesday night in Delaware show that WeWork has authorized the sale of as much as $780 million in shares as part of the round. Fortune and the Wall Street Journal reported details of the sale earlier. WeWork's last financing round, disclosed in June, valued it at $10 billion.Apple Ransomware Attack Casts Light on a Booming Shadow Industry: The first widespread ransomware attack on Apple Inc. computers is drawing attention to a growing and lucrative corner of the hacking underworld where attackers encrypt and hold data hostage until they are paid to unlock the information. An estimated 6,500 Macs were infected with malicious software designed to make files inaccessible to owners of desktops and laptops, according to the Transmission Project, a file-sharing software provider. The decision to target Apple’s OS X software, which is both harder to hack and less widespread than Microsoft Corp.’s Windows, underscores how attractive the practice has become, according to Clifford Neuman, who teaches cybersecurity at the University of Southern California. Researchers at Palo Alto Networks Inc. discovered the ransomware, which they dubbed KeRanger, on March 4. Once downloaded and installed, the bug demanded that users pay one bitcoin to decrypt the data, or about $411 at Friday’s prices. The researchers informed Apple, which revoked a certificate that allowed Macs to download the software, and Transmission updated its program to eliminate the infection, according to Ryan Olson, intelligence director at Palo Alto Networks. “The business model is working so well on Windows that, when they had an opportunity to do so on Mac, they did it,” Olson said. “It’s been effective to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a year.”Lyft is catching up with Uber in New York City: Lyft is gaining momentum in a key market for the company and its more established competitor, Uber. According to figures the company provided to Re/code, Lyft has seen its driver pool grow by a factor of four and has seen six times the number of active weekly riders in New York since May 2015. In February of this year, Lyft drivers in New York performed six times the total number of rides they performed in May 2015, the company said. It’s a clear indicator that New York riders and drivers have warmed up to the pink-mustachioed ride-hailing company despite Uber’s first-mover advantage. The growth in riders is in part a result of the recent fare cuts Lyft implemented across 33 cities, including New York (following Uber’s fare cuts in more than 80 cities), but it also follows the company’s increased investment in its marketing efforts both in terms of staff as well as in promotions and ad buys.Subleases spike in number as SF startups downsize: In January, office rents in San Francisco eclipsed those of New York to become the most expensive in the country. Two months later, there are signs the San Francisco may not maintain its dubious position for long. The biggest indicator: There’s suddenly 1.7 million square feet of sublease space available in San Francisco, up more than 50 percent from 1.1 million square feet in November, according to CBRE Group, a commercial real estate services and investment firm. That kind of jump in four months’ time suggests ripple effects from a funding slowdown that stretch beyond a small but growing number of layoffs. If the trend isn’t giving local landlords flashbacks of the late 1990s, it may soon. The Bay Area’s real estate market enjoyed a historically active 2015, with San Francisco accounting for the world’s highest rent growth at 14 percent, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield. The last time San Francisco surpassed New York in price per square footage, says CBRE, was 2000, the same year the tech market famously peaked, then abruptly imploded.Alibaba's Ant Financial could be valued at nearly $60 billion: source Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba arm, Ant Financial Services Group, is seeking a valuation of nearly $60 billion in its current round of funding, a person familiar with the matter said. Ant Financial, which operates the \"Alipay\" online payment platform, is in talks to raise funds from existing and new investors, which could include CCB International, the person said on Monday. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Monday that Ant Financial planned to raise up to 20 billion yuan ($3.07 billion), pegging its valuation at nearly $50 billion. Ant Financial declined comment on the Journal's story. The latest round of funding is expected to be completed by mid-April, the Journal reported. Tech Companies, New and Old, Clamor to Entice Cloud Computing Experts: The hunt for the hard-to-find talent that can build and run the massive data centers behind cloud computing is pitting three generations of companies against one another. Old-guard companies like Oracle, tech’s current giants like Amazon and its peers, as well as Bay Area start-ups are offering big salaries and big perks for cloud computing experts. On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years. Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure.Google also has a cloud computing office in the area. So does Facebook.“Someone working deep inside Amazon is getting five to 20 recruiting offers a day,” Ms. Anderson said. “Compensation has doubled in five years.” For a recruiter, who is typically paid a percentage of a star engineer’s compensation, “this is a very good time,” she said. Cloud computing, which powers an increasing number of our devices and services, allows a vast collection of computers — often spread around the world — to operate like one giant machine. As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data. Instead of asking about the latest computer coding languages or how to make a web page load faster, the most important question in tech hiring has become: Can you handle petabytes? That is the data in about 13 billion images, or roughly the amount of printed information that would fit in 20 million file cabinets. In the Bay Area, $125,000 a year is not an uncommon salary for someone newly out of graduate school with the expertise to do cloud computing work. With five years of experience, $300,000 along with a range of stock or job opportunities that greatly inflate the value of those paychecks have become the norm. “It’s an aggressive market,” said Corey Sanders, director of program management at Microsoft Azure. “We are all data engineers now, and we can convince people that this is the best place to learn that.”Prompt debuts “a command line for the real world”: In a world suffering from app overload, the Y Combinator-backed startup Prompt introduces a different way to interact with services, make purchases or even control “Internet of Things” devices — all by way of text-based interface. The application, which can be used via SMS, Slack or the web, lets you text to do things like request an Uber, change the temperature on a Nest thermostat, get directions, track flights or packages and a lot more. Apple users targeted in first known Mac ransomware campaign: Apple customers were targeted by hackers over the weekend in the first campaign against Macintosh computers using a pernicious type of software known as ransomware, researchers with Palo Alto Networks told Reuters on Sunday. Ransomware, one of the fastest-growing types of cyber threats, encrypts data on infected machines, then typically asks users to pay ransoms in hard-to-trace digital currencies to get an electronic key so they can retrieve their data. Palo Alto Threat Intelligence Director Ryan Olson said the \"KeRanger\" malware, which appeared on Friday, was the first functioning ransomware attacking Apple's Mac computers. \"This is the first one in the wild that is definitely functional, encrypts your files and seeks a ransom,\" Olson said in a telephone interview. Hackers infected Macs through a tainted copy of a popular program known as Transmission, which is used to transfer data through the BitTorrent peer-to-peer file sharing network, Palo Alto said on a blog posted on Sunday afternoon. FCC cracks down on Verizon Wireless for using ‘supercookies’: The Federal Communications Commission is cracking down on Verizon Wireless for using a powerful type of code to track its customers around the Internet, as the agency pushes to increase its role in protecting online privacy. The code, dubbed a \"supercookie\" by privacy advocates, is almost impossible to disable and could allow almost anyone to follow users around the Web. Under the terms of a settlement agreement announced Monday, Verizon must pay a $1.35 million fine and will only be able to use the tracking mechanism when users connect to Verizon's corporate family of services unless the company gets customers' opt-in consent. Broader use could leave customers' Web habits visible to outsiders. Verizon began putting a unique string of characters into customers' web browsing in 2012 to help target its advertising program. The practice came to the public's attention in late 2014, when it received criticism from privacy advocates who called the code a \"supercookie\" because the it was almost impossible for users to avoid. The privacy advocates warned then that other companies, or even intelligence agencies, could leverage the super cookies to track wherever people went online. Verizon downplayed that concern at the time, with a spokesperson saying that the code \"wouldn’t be able to be used for that.\" But last January, researcher Jonathan Mayer revealed evidence that others could hijack the supercookie for their own purposes: An online advertising company called Turn was using the codes to help follow people around online, he said. Turn used the supercookie to \"respawn\" its traditional cookies -- even if users took steps to protect their privacy by removing the cookies. Turn said it would stop and Verizon started offering a way for customers to opt-out of having the supercookie attached to their web traffic. But the FCC had already launched an investigation of Verizon's use of supercookies in December of 2014  -- and later brought Mayer on board as the chief technologist for the agency's enforcement arm. While the Federal Trade Commission is often thought of as the government's primary privacy watch dog, the FCC's power to police online privacy got a major boost last year. As a quirk of how the agency moved to enforce network neutrality rules, broadband providers will be subject to new privacy scrutiny. The FCC is in the process of coming up with a version of its privacy rules that apply to broadband Internet providers, which are expected soon.EBay Banks on Bar Codes for a Comeback: Hoping to outgrow its image as a glorified garage sale and move up in Google searches, EBay is turning to technology developed 70 years ago: the bar code. The machine-readable symbol that keeps supermarket lines moving is helping EBay manage vast amounts of data associated with the 6 billion products—from smartphones to video games, handbags to tires—listed at the online marketplace each year. Merchants will be able to enter a full description of a sales item by using a smartphone camera to scan its Universal Product Code. EBay reads the scan and automatically lists the item’s specifications. Before, every detail, including brand, model, and dimensions, was entered manually. UPCs are a central part of what EBay calls its “structured data initiative,” started in June, to organize items into a catalog that shoppers can easily search using filters such as price, features, and condition. The switch started with auto parts and accessories, one of EBay’s fastest-growing categories. The UPC is also used to call up consumer reviews and product images, which create a degree of permanence on EBay that search engines will reward with better placement. EBay says the code provides a sufficient baseline of information because 80 percent of all products sold there are new. A key goal is to standardize the amount and type of information that merchants list. The initiative will eventually expand to most items on the site.So far, some merchants like the change. Quick Ship Electronics, which sells consumer devices on EBay, had some desktop computers and laptops languishing in its inventory. Once the company entered the UPCs on EBay’s catalog, the items sold within days, CEO Jordan Insley says. Apple supplier Broadcom to slash 1,900 jobs globally: Chipmaker Broadcom Ltd, the company created following the merger of Avago and Broadcom, said it would cut about 1,900 jobs globally across its businesses. Shares of Broadcom, which also supplies to Apple Inc, were up 8 percent at $148.20 in extended trading on Thursday. The company said it expects to take charges of about $650 million related to the job cuts through 2018.  Avago completed its $37 billion deal for Broadcom last month. Revenue for the legacy Avago business fell 4 percent to $1.77 billion in the three months ended January 31.Snapchat Raises $175 Million From Fidelity at Flat $16 Billion Valuation: Snapchat has raised $175 million in new venture funding from Fidelity at the same $16 billion valuation it raised at back in May, according to a source familiar with the deal. That means Snapchat has now raised around $1.4 billion in total. The Wall Street Journalfirst reported the new funding. A flat valuation isn’t usually a great sign, but the raise comes at a time when lots of tech companies — including Jawbone and Foursquare — are raising down rounds, or taking money at a lower valuation than their last fundraising. In that vein, this investment doesn’t look bad.With Bet on Japan, Sharp Stumbles: When flat-screen televisions began replacing boxy analog sets in the world’s living rooms more than a decade ago, few companies bet bigger on the new technology than Sharp of Japan. The century-old manufacturer, which got its start making belt buckles andmechanical pencils before World War I, defied corporate orthodoxy by building an advanced new display factory in its homeland, while rivals outsourced to cheaper countries. The gamble paid off — for a while. Made-in-Japan Kameyama model TVs, named for the factory, became a hit, and Sharp reaped big profits. “We were winners then,” said Yukihiko Nakata, an engineer who worked for 33 years at Sharp. Those days are over. Sharp is now mired in losses and its future is in doubt. Sharp’s plight is a story of missteps by executives who failed to anticipate major shifts in the global electronics industry. China, long the home of cheap manufacturing, has become increasingly sophisticated, making gadgets that can rival Japan’s in quality. Rivals elsewhere are challenging Japanese companies on innovation. The industry’s center of power has moved away from Japan to places like China, South Korea and Silicon Valley in the United States. Sharp’s leaders were slow to adapt, employees and industry experts say. Unwilling to change strategy when business conditions turned against them, they doubled down on investments in increasingly unprofitable businesses, deepening the company’s financial distress. As prices of liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs, began falling quickly in the mid-2000s, because of advances in manufacturing and a supply glut in China, Sharp scrambled to keep ahead of cheaper competitors. It developed ever-bigger TV displays and expanded into touch screens for smartphones and tablet computers. But rivals matched it more quickly than executives had anticipated, said Mr. Nakata, who left Sharp a decade ago and is now a professor at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University in Japan. Sharp had found a rescuer in a Taiwanese company called Foxconn, which makes gadgets for Apple and others and was offering a $5.5 billion lifeline. But Sharp unexpectedly told its would-be rescuer last week that it could be liable for close to $3 billion in potential costs, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. Foxconn is still examining the sudden disclosure, and it isn’t clear whether the Taiwanese company will complete the deal.Messaging Startup Slack Seeks Up to $4 Billion Valuation in an 'Up' Funding Round: The company is said to be in talks to raise $150 million to $300 million in financing. Slack Technologies Inc., which runs a messaging service for businesses, is seeking an investment that would value the company at $3.5 billion to $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Slack is looking to raise $150 million to $300 million as part of the round, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the terms aren't finalized. The talks are ongoing, and a lead investor has not been selected, the people said. If successful, Slack's fundraising round would stand out. Venture investment in startups dropped about 30 percent in the fourth quarter compared with the previous one, according to research firm CB Insights. Also during the last three months of the year, 26 percent of mature startups raised money at lower valuations than in earlier rounds, according to a study by law firm Fenwick & West LLP. Even as startup fundraising shows signs of slowing and valuations begin to tumble, a few companies are pushing ahead. Slack said it raised $160 million less than a year ago, valuing the company at $2.8 billion. It's raised more than $300 million in total and has also used its fundraising clout to create an $80 million venture fund with several of its investors to back Slack-related apps. Slack, which launched its current business about two years ago, said it has 2.3 million daily active users, up from 520,000 a year ago. The company also said it had more than $64 million in annual recurring revenue. The metric projects the value of current customers over the course of a year, and the number can differ substantially from actual revenue for fast-growing startups.Tech start-ups the new gold for China's wealthy as economy slows: More wealthy Chinese are ploughing money into technology start-ups which are increasingly seen as a safe haven as the slowing economy eases hopes of extracting returns from traditional investment such as stocks, property or gold. While Chinese shares are being pummelled and the yuan is under pressure, these private investors are turning to businesses such as taxi-hailing company Didi Kuaidi, which saw its valuation rise 25 percent to about $20 billion in a $1 billion funding round launched last week. This gain sharply contrasts with the 43 percent plunge in the CSI 300 index of top-listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen since June last year, underscoring the appetite for tech firms. China's stock markets are the worst performing in the region, according to Thomson Reuters data. Even some mid-sized banks, including China Merchants Bank are investing into tech ventures. What is unique about China's venture capital and private equity industry is that a good chunk of yuan fund raising comes from wealthy individual investors. This contrasts with Western markets, where institutional investors take the lion's share of such placements. A lawyer told Reuters she had recently structured several investment deals into tech companies for wealthy clients. She declined to be named, or give details of the deals due to the confidentiality of the matter.Is Verizon Buying Yahoo? A Resounding … Maybe. Verizon is still considering a purchase of Yahoo, but said it needs to better understand the Internet company’s assets before deciding whether to make a formal bid. “I don’t think anybody knows what’s under the hood,” CFO Fran Shammo said at a Morgan Stanley investment conference on Tuesday. Shammo said the company is considering all kinds of merger and acquisition options, including both purchases and divestments. He confirmed that the company is still weighing, for example, whether to hold on to or sell its data centers. “Is it better off outside of our portfolio?” he said. “We’re looking at that.”Fidelity Writes Down Value of Corporate Software Startups: Fidelity Investments slashed the value of its holdings in several corporate software startups in January, while taking a more optimistic view of private consumer-technology companies such as Snapchat and Uber. The value of Dropbox Inc. shares were marked down 10 percent in January from the price in December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from public filings. Fidelity also wrote down its stake in the cloud storage company last year. The fund manager periodically readjusts the value of its private stock holdings, based on a variety of factors, and is required to disclose the new values publicly. CloudFlare Inc., maker of Web performance and cybersecurity software for businesses, took a much bigger hit. Fidelity marked down its holdings in that company by 31 percent. CloudFlare Chief Executive Officer Matthew Prince blamed the writedown on market conditions and said Fidelity had marked up the company's value twice before. \"When the market recovers, we'll recover with it,\" he said. Although Prince wasn't happy about the decrease, he saw it as a \"baby step\" toward becoming a public company, when a company's stock price fluctuates constantly. DocuSign Inc., which makes electronic signature technology for contracts and other documents, and Nutanix Inc., a maker of software and hardware for data centers that filed to go public in December, were each written down by 17 percent. Fidelity also marked down Twilio Inc., which makes tools for app developers, by 13 percent. Consumer apps fared better in January. Fidelity did not change its valuations for Airbnb Inc., Pinterest Inc., Snapchat, and Uber, despite a rough month in the public markets and signs of a slowdown in private investments. About a quarter of mature startups raised money at lower valuations in the fourth quarter than in previous rounds, according to a study by Silicon Valley law firm Fenwick & West LLP. More than half of those later-stage deals included terms that guarantee new investors get their money back before other shareholders. Fidelity's markdowns of corporate software startups came after a brutal month for their publicly traded peers. IBM and VMware Inc. reported disappointing earnings forecasts in January. Many technology companies said they expected a tough IT climate for 2016 and often cited a deteriorating macroeconomic environment as a factor. The Standard and Poor's 500 Index was down 5.1 percent in January, but several enterprise software companies were well below that. Box Inc., a Dropbox rival, plunged 23 percent. Workday Inc. fell 21 percent. Salesforce.com Inc. dropped 13 percent. Despite the dismal climate, Fidelity didn't write down every enterprise startup. For example, the fund manager kept the value of its shares in Cloudera Inc., a Silicon Valley Big Data company, unchanged in January.SurveyMonkey to Lay Off 100 and Retool Business Product: Cloud-based polling service SurveyMonkey informed employees today that it is letting go of about 100 people in a plan to retool its product aimed at businesses, which is not living up to expectations. The layoffs were to be disclosed at an internal meeting this afternoon. The cuts amount to about 13 percent of SurveyMonkey’s workforce of about 750. The cuts were made primarily among the sales team devoted to SurveyMonkey for Business.  The move comes six weeks into the tenure of SurveyMonkey’s new CEO Zander Lurie, the former GoPro exec who joined in January. In an interview, Lurie told Re/code that SurveyMonkey, which is privately held, is on track to post $200 million in 2016 with an Ebitda profit margin of north of 30 percent.Souq, Online Retailer in Middle East, Gets a $275 Million Boost:  Souq.com, an online retailer based in the United Arab Emirates, said on Monday that it had raised $275 million from international investors. It was a vote of confidence for digital commerce in the Middle East, which has made little headway compared with elsewhere. Souq, the largest e-commerce company in the Middle East, was founded in 2005 on an eBay-like online auction model, but it subsequently evolved into more of an Amazon-style set-price retailer. It has been a rare success story in a region where online businesses face logistical problems, political challenges, stifling bureaucracy and regulations that vary greatly from country to country. Souq’s latest round of funding included money from the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, as well as from Standard Chartered Private Equity and the International Finance Corporation, which is an arm of the World Bank. Souq, which means market in Arabic, did not provide details on what the funding round meant for its overall valuation, and it has not released details on its annual sales or profit. The $275 million funding round was, however, the largest ever disclosed by a technology start-up in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Wamda, a research firm based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. Even after multiple fund-raising rounds, the Jabbar Internet Group — which sold Maktoob, a news site, to Yahoo for more than $150 million in 2009 — still holds a majority stake. Souq, now the largest online retailer in the Arab world, ships hundreds of thousands of products across the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also has operations in Egypt.For the first time, Google’s self-driving car takes some blame for a crash: A Google self-driving car sideswiped a bus this month, the first blemish on the otherwise spotless driving record of the company’s vehicles. Google’s 53 vehicles have driven more than 1.4 million miles autonomously and been in 17 crashes, but never been at fault before. The crash took place at 3:20 p.m. Feb. 14, about three miles from Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Google’s car was attempting to make a right-hand turn on red, and moved to the right side of a wide lane on El Camino Real to pass traffic stopped at the light. But as Google’s car neared the intersection of Castro Street, its path was blocked by sandbags around a storm drain, according to a report Google filed with the California DMV. Google’s car tried to go around the sandbags by cutting into the line of vehicles on the left side of the lane. Instead, it struck a metal piece connecting the two halves of an accordion-style bus, according to a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority spokeswoman. Google said its car was going less than 2 mph and the bus was moving at 15 mph. Both parties said there were no injuries and described the crash as minor. The 15 passengers on the bus were transferred to another bus following the accident. Google characterized the crash as a misunderstanding and a learning experience, saying its cars will learn that large vehicles are less likely to yield than other types of vehicles.Raspberry Pi 3 Launches — 50% Faster, With Wi-Fi, Bluetooth And An Eye On IoT: A major new Raspberry Pi microprocessor has been announced today: the Pi 3 Model B board becomes the new top-of-the-line Pi, with a 64bit 1.2GHz quad-core chipset and 1GB RAM it’s being slated to offer a 50 per cent power bump over the Pi 2. But is still priced at just $35 — the original Model B Pi price-tag, four years on from its debut. Round about this time last year the Pi Foundation launched the 900Mhz quad-core Pi 2 — which was 6x faster than the then top-of-the-Pi-line Model B+ board, and dubbed an affordable “entry-level PC”. Also priced at $35. The Foundation is touting the Pi 3 as opening up “even more possibilities for IoT and embedded projects”. Speaking to the BBC, Pi founder Eben Upton said: “This is the first Pi you can stick behind your TV and completely forget about.” “The two main things that people do with their Pi are use it as a PC replacement or use it as an embedded computer,” he added. “The Pi 3 is doubling down on both those things rather than going looking for new things to do.” The really big deal here is the inclusion of built in wireless LAN and Bluetooth. The Pi 2 had Ethernet but makers wanting the board to support wireless connectivity had to add a wi-fi or Bluetooth dongle. The Pi 3 removes the need to buy wireless add-ons, so it’s being positioned for out-of-the-box IoT development and as a powerful IoT hub that can link together multiple in-home connected devices. Back in November, the Pi Foundation launched another new board: the single core 1GHz Pi Zero delivers a lot less on the processing performance front and lacks on-board connectivity options (a wi-fi dongle can be plugged into its micro-USB port) but it costs just $5 — a price-point that’s clearly targeting makers wanting to build individual IoT/connected devices. The more powerful and well connected Pi 3 doubles down on the growth in IoT devices the Pi Zero was seeking to encourage — following on from the Pi 2, which was capable of running a version of Microsoft Windows that’s designed to support IoT apps (aka Windows 10 IoT; formerly called Windows Embedded). At a launch event today the Foundation said it has worked closely with Microsoft to ensure full compatibility between the new Pi 3 board and Windows 10 IoT.Morgan Stanley fund marks down Flipkart stake value by 27%: A mutual fund investor in Flipkart Ltd, India’s largest e-commerce firm, has slashed the value of its holdings by as much as 27%, the latest indication that the investor rush of the past two years into Indian startups has led to unsustainable valuations.Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust valued its stake in Flipkart at $58.9 million as of 31 December, down from $80.6 million in June 2015. The company reported the number late Friday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US stock markets regulator. Morgan Stanley Institutional Fund Trust also cut the value of its stake in other high flying startups including file storage company Dropbox Inc. and data analytics company Palantir.Flipkart was valued at $15 billion when it received $700 million from Tiger Global Management, Qatar Investment Authority and other investors in June. That was its fourth round of fund raising in a year. Its valuation shot up roughly 5 times from $2.5-3 billion in May 2014. Morgan Stanley’s latest estimate implies that the mutual fund currently values Flipkart at $11 billion. Mint reported on 4 February that China’s Alibaba Group is in early talks to buy a stake in Flipkart and increase its holding in Flipkart rival, Snapdeal. The talks are at a very initial stage and the likelihood of a deal is a function of Flipkart’s willingness to offer a discount on its current valuation of $15 billion, Mint had reported then. There are not too many takers for India’s top e-commerce firms at their current valuations, prompting both Flipkart and Snapdeal  to approach Alibaba Group for cash. Early last year, Flipkart set a target of generating annualized gross merchandise value (GMV) of $8 billion by December. However, the company’s current average monthly annualized GMV is roughly $5 billion, Mint reported on 17 February. This number, which includes sales at Flipkart’s unit Myntra, indicates Flipkart missed its internal sales target.In ‘Strategic Refocus,’ Troubled Zenefits Lets 250 Employees Go: Zenefits, the troubled benefits software company that three weeks ago fired its founding CEO, said today that it has laid off 250 employees, mostly in its sales recruiting organization. In a memo to employees, CEO David Sacks said the move signals an intention to “rebuild in line with our new company values.” Zenefits, which sells employee health insurance plans alongside free software to administer those plans, was been rocked by disclosures that many of its employees are not properly licensed to sell insurance. The job cuts amount to about 17 percent of the Zenefits workforce. The company has until recently been considered a Silicon Valley high-flyer, having raised $500 million from investors at a valuation of $4.5 billion. From an email from new CEO David Sacks: \"We are reducing our headcount by roughly 250 employees, or about 17 percent of total employees. These changes are almost entirely in the Sales organization, with about a dozen employees in Recruiting. Within the Sales organization, we are eliminating the Enterprise team (although some members will be offered other roles). We are also making a large reduction in Sales Development Representatives (SDR), the organization that prospected for the largest accounts.I want to make clear that this is a reduction in force (RIF), meaning that we are not cutting these jobs for performance reasons. We are letting go of many great people today, and it is not their fault. It is no secret that Zenefits grew too fast, stretching both our culture and our controls. This reduction enables us to refocus our strategy, rebuild in line with our new company values, and grow in a controlled way that will be strategic for our business and beneficial for our customers.\"Anonmyous Flyers Posted At Palantir's Campus Warn Employees That Stock Is Worthless - Flyers Are False: Employees of data-analysis company Palantir  may have seen flyers posted on lampposts around their Silicon Valley offices this week featuring a disemboweled unicorn with rainbow blood streaming from its midsection. The posting, dated Feb. 23, warned: \"Palantir workers: your common shares are worth $0.00.\" Palantir staff can relax a bit. The terms of recent fundraising rounds don't contain many of the provisions that can crush the value of common shares held by employees.Fundraising talks last year valued Palantir at $20 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said in June. While Palantir shares are trading lower on secondary markets than they were last year, the same can be said for many stocks, private and public, thanks to a global economic slowdown. Palantir common stock fetches $8.50 to $10 a share on secondary markets before fees, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private share sales. That's a long way from zero. Palantir declined to comment. Several flyers have already been removed, according to Quartz. Someone posting on an online community forum under the pseudonym Palantir_Watcher claimed responsibility for creating the handouts. The person didn't respond to a request for comment. However, the guerilla campaign tapped into an undercurrent of uncertainty and fear about what private companies in Silicon Valley are worth after a wave ofwritedowns and cost-cutting at startups. Venture capitalists and other institutional investors typically hold preferred shares. They are worth more on secondary markets than common stock, which is what is given to employees, often representing a significant portion of their compensation. However, Palantir hasn't given newer investors the sort of preferential treatment awarded to shareholders of companies such as DocuSign Inc., Honest Co., and Stripe Inc., according to an analysis by the technology website the Information. The proportion of funding rounds that gave senior liquidation preferences to new investors was on the rise last year among companies with valuations of at least $1 billion, according to a study by law firm Fenwick & West. That allows those new investors to cash out before common shareholders, as well as earlier investors with preferred shares. During the fourth quarter of 2015, 42 percent of deals had such provisions, compared with 15 percent in the previous two quarters. Investors were also given the right to block an initial public offering that didn't meet their valuation threshold in 33 percent of deals in the fourth quarter, compared with 20 percent in the second quarter, the study said. Palantir had neither provision.FoxConn Agrees To Buy Sharp, Then Pulls Back On Discovering New Liabilities: Taiwan's Foxconn has put its takeover of Sharp Corp on hold after discovering previously undisclosed liabilities, sources said, throwing the acquisition in doubt and sending shares of the Japanese electronics maker tumbling. Loss-making Sharp announced on Thursday that it had agreed to be bought by Foxconn, a contract manufacturing firm formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co and major Apple Inc supplier. Just hours later, Foxconn said it would not sign the deal until it had clarified some \"new material information\" from Sharp. It did not elaborate. Shares slid 14 percent on Friday morning, adding to a drop of 14 percent a day earlier as the planned share dilution looked larger than expected. \"That puts the entire deal in jeopardy,\" Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal said in a note to clients. \"This is especially so given the dramatic back and forth that happened between Sharp and Foxconn in 2012, when Foxconn agreed to acquire a stake in Sharp but then later walked away.\" Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the Japanese group had contingent liabilities that amounted to \"hundreds of billions of yen.\" The sources did not elaborate on the nature of the liabilities or the exact amount. Reuters has not seen any documents regarding the new information. The 11th hour delay jeopardizes a deal that would have marked the conclusion to five years of courting by Foxconn founder and billionaire Terry Gou and the opening up of Japan's insular tech sector to foreign investment. The loss-making display maker said on Thursday that it would issue around $4.4 billion worth of new shares to give Foxconn a two-thirds stake. Foxconn's investment is set to total more than 650 billion yen ($5.8 billion), a separate source familiar with the matter said. If a deal does go through, it would boost Foxconn's position as Apple's main contract manufacturer and enable Sharp to start mass-producing organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens by 2018, around the time Apple is expected to adopt the next-generation displays for its iPhones. But efforts to patch up the deal could be impeded by lingering distrust over the collapse of the 2012 deal to form capital ties. That distrust was one reason Sharp officials, until recently, preferred a lower offer by the state-backed Innovation Network Corp of Japan.Microsoft will pay about $400 million for software developer tools startup Xamarin, according to people with knowledge of the agreement.The deal was announced Wednesday by both companies without terms. Xamarin had sales of about $30 million for 2015 and expects to approximately double that in the current year, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details of the purchase aren’t public. Microsoft Is Buying a Company That Is Key to Its Cross-Platform Future: Microsoft today says it's acquiring mobile app development startup Xamarin for an undisclosed sum, giving the company a tool for building mobile apps that can work across iOS, Android, and Windows phones. Xamarin, which has 15,000 customers including large brand names like Coca-Cola and JetBlue, allows developers to code in a single programming language while designing an app to look native to each platform. Xamarin also offers a way for developers to test those apps using thousands of cloud-hosted devices. One of the four-year-old startup's main products relies on Microsoft's Visual Studio software, so this acquisition is a natural pairing.Airbnb Admits It Removed 1,500 Listings in New York Before Releasing Data to Regulators: Before Airbnb Inc. shared data on its business in New York City, the home-rental website removed about 1,500 listings controlled by full-time landlords. The company disclosed the removals in a letter to New York state legislators on Wednesday as it faces criticism over becoming a platform for unregulated hotels.  Airbnb said it kicked off 622 hosts as part of the effort in November. The cuts helped portray a rosier picture of its New York City operations in the data released in December. The company had not outlined the extent of its removals when it initially presented the data publicly. The deleted listings accounted for about 4 percent of those offered in the city. Josh Meltzer, the company's head of public policy in New York, wrote in the letter to legislators that the listings \"did not reflect Airbnb's vision for our community.\" Airbnb has faced questions from city officials who have said real-estate developers are using Airbnb to rent out homes instead of selling them to permanent residents. The practice risks driving up housing prices. Airbnb defeated a proposal in San Francisco last year that would have restricted the company's business in its hometown. Airbnb spent $8 million to fight the effort. \"In New York City, where housing prices and availability are a critical issue, we want to work with our community and policymakers to help prevent short-term rentals from impacting the availability and cost of permanent housing for city residents,\" Meltzer wrote in the letter. \"While home sharing has been around for centuries, our people-to-people home sharing platform is new. And Airbnb is a young company. We have learned that a one-size fits all approach to cities will not work.\" Along with the letter to New York lawmakers, Airbnb released updated data on its operations in the city. Of hosts renting their entire homes in New York City, 38 percent of revenue came from those listing two or more homes on the website. Hosts with six or more homes on Airbnb generated 6 percent of revenue.Google Fiber Is Finally Coming to San Francisco: Google Fiber is coming to its own backyard. Well, in moderation. On Wednesday, the high-speed broadband and cable business, announced that it will start servicing “some” apartments, condos and affordable housing units in San Francisco, the urban hub north of its Silicon Valley headquarters. It’s not saying how many connections, when they’ll come or how much they’ll cost.But it is definitely coming, unlike other cities where Fiber has said that it is “exploring” an arrival. That makes San Francisco among the largest metropolitan areas for Fiber, which has, so far, kept to smaller cities clamoring for its service (and where it can more quickly gain broadband market share).It’s a symbolic entry — landing near Silicon Valley — as well as a commercial one: The city is full of tech companies and techies that have also clamored for super fast Internet.Comcast* and AT&T, two of Fiber’s chief competitors, have both announced intentions to bring gigabit Internet to the city. While Fiber has primarily focused on residential lines, it could expand into enterprise services, something Comcast has made a push for.Google is accelerating its enterprise business, which includes a team dedicated to getting startups on Google services. It’s not clear if that includes Fiber, which is housed under the Access subsidiary of Google’s Alphabet. Uber China Rival Didi Kuaidi Raising $1 Billion at Valuation of More Than $20 Billion: Didi Kuaidi, the biggest ride-hailing company in China, has received at least $1 billion in commitments for a new fundraising round, according to a person familiar with the matter. Once the financing closes, it would value the Uber rival at more than $20 billion, said the person, who asked not to be named because the terms aren't final. The round is oversubscribed, and the company is still negotiating terms with investors, the person said. Didi Kuaidi declined to comment. Didi Kuaidi is spending heavily on adding new drivers and offering competitive fare prices as it aims to stay ahead of Uber Technologies Inc. in China. Uber spent more than $1 billion in the country last year and plans to spend a comparable amount in 2016. In the first three quarters of 2015, Uber lost $1.7 billion, much of that going toward expansion in Asia, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in January. Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick said last week that the company is profitable in the U.S., according to Canadian technology blog BetaKit. It's unclear how the metric was calculated. Didi Kuaidi raised $3 billion last year at a $16.5 billion valuation. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported the Chinese company's latest fundraising round. To take on Uber, Didi Kuaidi has formed an international coalition with the likes of Lyft Inc. in the U.S. and Ola in India. Uber was last valued by investors at $62.5 billion, and the company has raised more than $10 billion in the five years since it started picking up passengers.European Tech Scene Begins to Feel Silicon Valley’s Woes: At the offices of Deliveroo, a food delivery start-up with headquarters in an upmarket neighborhood here, signs of activity are everywhere. The communal kitchen hums with 20-something developers. A gold-painted scooter, which the co-founder William Shu once used to make deliveries, stands in the center of the office as people bustle about. The frenetic pace belies a more cautious approach that Mr. Shu, 36, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, has recently started taking at the start-up.Over the last year, Mr. Shu has urged colleagues to be more circumspect with growth plans, forgoing rapid expansion in competitive markets like the United States to focus on places where Deliveroo already has a loyal following. And while the start-up has raised almost $200 million, employs roughly 400 people worldwide and operates in 12 countries, Mr. Shu says profitability — and not just aggressive growth to beat rivals to new markets — is increasingly important as the company moves beyond its British roots. The focus at Deliveroo is symptomatic of a change across many European start-ups. Just as in Silicon Valley, where a number of privately held tech companies have been stung by lower valuations and investor questions about their sustainability, that same unease has now reached Europe’s tech community, in a sign that a move away from soaring boom times in start-ups is going global. Driving the pullback are some of the same forces that have caused a change in Silicon Valley’s start-up scene. Tech stocks are gyrating because of fears of a global economic slowdown — exacerbated in Europe by the region’s migrant crisis and persistent financial problems. Valuations of some start-ups worldwide got ahead of themselves. As a result, venture capitalists in Europe and farther afield are becoming more cautious about funding local start-ups that do not have proven business ideas. “When Silicon Valley sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold,” said Fred Destin, a partner at the London office of Accel Partners, a venture capital firm. “It’s only a matter of time before Europe faces the same issues that we’re seeing on the West Coast.” In Europe, that is leading to situations like that of Powa Technologies. Last week , Powa, an e-commerce company based in London, entered into administration, a form of bankruptcy. The start-up had raised $175 million since 2013 but had failed to win enough customers for its mobile shopping technology. Deloitte, which is overseeing the sale of the company’s assets, says it is now working to find buyers for the business. Truecaller, a Swedish start-up that had raised around $80 million for its caller ID smartphone application, recently laid off about 20 percent of its staff. A company spokesman declined to comment on the layoffs and said Truecaller remained committed to its business. And SwiftKey, a popular predictive typing smartphone application used by more than 300 million people worldwide, was bought by Microsoft this month for a reported $250 million, which was significantly less than what many of SwiftKey’s investors had expected. “You can already see more hesitance and lower valuations,” Christian Reber, founder of 6Wunderkinder, a German start-up bought by Microsoft last year, said in an email. “The market correction will continue, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.”MasterCard will let you to take a selfie to complete purchases: MasterCard wants to use your face to help fend off fraudsters. Using a new system called MasterCard Identity Check -- or, colloquially, \"selfie pay\" -- the credit card company will use biometric methods like face recognition and fingerprint scans to better secure online shopping. Right now, Mastercard offers a feature that financial institutions can enable that lets customers set up a password for online payments to help prevent fraud. The new system will use the same principle, but instead of relying on a password that could be forgotten or stolen, it uses your face or fingerprint. Consumers will go through all the normal steps of filling out credit card information when making an online purchase, but this feature adds another step: The website will send a notification through an app on customers' smartphones that asks them to verify their identity. This can be done either through a fingerprint scan or by using the phone's camera to take a brief, selfie-like, video. When taking the \"selfie,\" the user will have to blink to prove that it's a live person and not just an old photo being used to spoof the system.Lenovo aims at mature markets with new 'augmented reality' phone: China's Lenovo Group is ready to break into mature markets this summer with the launch of its new smartphone which sports 'augmented reality' features developed under Google's Tango project, its chief executive said on Tuesday. The device, which was announced at the 2016 CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas in January, will launch in July, Chief Executive Yang Yuanqing said in an interview at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Declining to give additional information he said that the phone will include Google's Project Tango technology and more. Project Tango combines 3D motion tracking with depth sensors to give a mobile device the ability to know where it is and how it moves through an area, creating the potential to use augmented reality features on the phone. Augmented reality software then overlays text or graphics on the real-life image. It differs from virtual reality, which seeks to simulate real-world views.Tech IPO Freeze Is Sign of Investor Reality Check: The tech IPO market is frozen. Storage vendor Nutanix is further proof. It's been over three months since Square and Match Group debuted, and not a single software or Internet company has followed. Seven of the past 10 technology companies to go public are trading below their offer price, and four are down by at least 20 percent, according to FactSet. Nutanix, which filed its IPO prospectus in December, is holding off on selling shares until the stock market volatility wanes, said sources familiar with the matter. The developer of data center technology that wraps together storage, servers and virtualization was set to go public in late January, but has been advised by its bankers to wait for the market to calm, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. No other high-profile tech companies are publicly on file. Last month, online lender Elevate Credit delayed its IPO due to market conditions, as January marked the worst month for the Nasdaq since 2010. The index is still down 8.5 percent to start the year even after rallying over the past week. For Silicon Valley's financiers, this is all troubling. Big IPOs are their lifeblood. That's how venture investors make outsized profits and justify the billions of dollars they pour annually into start-ups that ultimately go bust or fail to generate returns. Last year should have been a banner year for IPOs. The Nasdaq topped 5,000 for the first time since 2000, and rose for the fourth consecutive year. Investors expressed appetite for risk, bidding up Amazon.comand Netflix, the year's two best large-cap performers. Yet, tech companies went public at the slowest pace since 2009. Instead of IPOs, the highest growth companies were raising mega-rounds of cash in the private market at valuations and revenue multiples that exceeded what public investors were paying. Hedge funds and private equity firms distorted the IPO cycle, putting piles of cash into companies but without rewarding early investors and employees the way public offerings do. Late-stage private financing almost doubled from $8.9 billion in 2013 to $16 billion last year, according to the National Venture Capital Association, with companies including Uber, Airbnb, SpaceX and SoFi each reeling in at least $1 billion. That could mean a painfully dilutive private investment round, selling the business at a loss to some investors or going public at a price below what earlier investors paid. \"People just have to get real,\" said Golden, a managing partner at Revolution Ventures in San Francisco and former director of JPMorgan's technology investment banking practice. \"When markets are speaking, we may not like what they're saying but we have to listen.\"A New Breed of Trader on Wall Street: Coders With a Ph.D.: While traders at large investment banks watched their screens in horror, at Jane Street, a bunch of Harvard Ph.D.s wearing flip-flops, shorts and hoodies, swung into action with a wave of buy orders. By the end of the day, the E.T.F. shares had retraced their sharp falls. “It’s remarkable what they can do,” said Blair Hull, a founder of an electronic trading firm who relies on Jane Street to make a market for his recently started E.T.F. “If you look at who provides this kind of liquidity these days, it’s fewer and fewer firms.” It is not only Jane Street, of course. Cantor Fitzgerald, the Knight Capital Group and the Susquehanna International Group have all capitalized on the E.T.F. explosion. And as these firms have grown, so has the demand for a new breed of Wall Street trader — one who can build financial models and write computer code but who also has the guts to spot a market anomaly and bet big with the firm’s capital. In a word, these are not your suit-and-tie bond and stock traders of yore, riding the commuter train into Manhattan. They are, instead, the pick of the global brain crop. Here is a small sample of Jane Street’s main traders: Tao Wang (doctorate in philosophy and finance from the National University of Singapore), Min Zhu (master’s in chemistry, Columbia), Brett Harrison (master’s in computer science with a focus in artificial intelligence, Harvard) and Srihari Seshadri (bachelor’s in computer science, Carnegie Mellon). Jane Street was founded at the beginning of the previous decade, when a couple of option traders and a computer expert left Susquehanna to start their own business. Harnessing Ph.D.-toting mathematicians to the most powerful computers money can buy has become the accepted way for hedge funds and banks to get a trading edge these days, but Jane Street takes this marriage of high tech and high intellect to a new level. Writing computer code, or at the least being conversant in the firm’s program of choice, OCaml, is a requisite for all traders. Indeed, new traders must complete a monthlong OCaml boot camp before they start trading. And to the degree that the super-shy Jane Street does has have a public face, it belongs to its chief technology officer, Yaron Minsky, who givesfrequent lectures at Harvard, M.I.T. and Carnegie Mellon, promoting the firm’s ability to manage risk by developing the best software around.A Do-It-Yourself Revolution in Diabetes Care: John Costik got the call at the office in 2012. It was his wife, Laura, with terrible news: Their 4-year-old son, Evan, was headed into the emergency room. His blood sugar reading was sky high, about 535 mg/dl, and doctors had discovered he had Type 1 diabetes. The first three days in the hospital were a blur during which the Costiks, engineers in Rochester, received a crash course in managing the basics of diabetes care.For starters, they were told to log their son’s numbers on paper forms. It was their first hint that diabetes management did not occupy a place on technology’s bleeding edge. The methods for guesstimating carbohydrate intake also seemed imprecise, Mr. Costik found, and the process generated a lot of wasted data.“The last thing you want to do is find some form and fill it out,” he said. “You’re really just emotionally trying to cope with it, and that data in that book isn’t necessarily useful to the people with diabetes.” Several months later, Mr. Costik fitted his son with a Dexcom G4 continuous glucose monitor. A hair-thin sensor under Evan’s skin recorded an exact blood sugar reading at five-minute intervals, 24 hours a day.But all that data left with Evan every morning when he headed off to day care. Mr. Costik wanted something better: continuous access to his son’s glucose readings.So he examined the device’s software code and wrote a simple program that transmitted the monitoring data to an online spreadsheet he could view on a Web browser, Android mobile phone or, eventually, his Pebble smartwatch. Now, as consumer gadgets weave themselves ever more tightly into everyday life, patients and their families are finding homespun solutions to problems medical-device manufacturers originally did not address. Industry executives say the pace of user-driven innovation was one reason the Food and Drug Administration recently reclassified remote glucose-monitoring devices, hastening approval for new models by big companies like Dexcom and Medtronics. James Wedding, a civil engineer who lives outside Dallas, saw Mr. Costik’s Twitter post and used his code to set up a remote monitor system for his daughter, Carson, who is now 12. Lane Desborough, an engineer in California, got in touch with Mr. Costik after seeing his tweet, ultimately creating an open-source system based in part on Mr. Costik’s code. It allows anyone to hack existing glucose monitors so they transmit readings to the cloud, where they can be read by patients and caregivers.Mr. Desborough called the project Nightscout. The Nightscout group onFacebook, known as CGM in the Cloud, provides free tech support for users trying to improve on monitoring devices.About two dozen users have even started a project called Open APS, in which they are pairing insulin pumps with glucose monitors in an effort to create an open-source artificial pancreas system. These wearable devices, which automate insulin delivery, are being tested in academic settings, but these early adopters are not waiting for the results of those continuing clinical trials.Mr. Costik now works at the Center for Clinical Innovation at the University of Rochester, where he works to improve management options for all patients; Mr. Desborough is now the chief engineer at Bigfoot Biomedical, a start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., that plans to create an artificial pancreas.New Chinese Rules on Foreign Firms’ Online Content: China is taking another step to restrict what can be posted on the Internet in its country by issuing new rules barring foreign companies or their affiliates from engaging in publishing online content there without government approval. The rules, which were jointly released this week by the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said that beginning March 10, foreign companies or foreign joint ventures will be restricted from disseminating a wide range of content online, including text, maps, games, animation, audio and video. The rules also apply to digitized books, art, literature and science. The new regulations would allow foreign-owned companies to cooperate with a Chinese partner to publish content on the Web in China, but they must get government approval. China already has some of the world’s most restrictive policies on the dissemination of information. Chinese TV and the news media are censored; the government has censors monitoring popular social media platforms, like WeChat; and American Internet giants, like Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been blocked in China for years. One key question is the impact such regulations would have on companies like Apple and Microsoft, which run online platforms in China that provide services and sometimes content. For example, Apple’s Chinese App Store offers games and other apps in the country while Microsoft has a joint venture through which it provides a cloud version of Windows and Office software. Internet companies, like Akamai and Cloud Flare, have operations that work to speed traffic to foreign websites or host them through servers in China.Apple Still Holds the Keys to Its Cloud Service, but Reluctantly: In Silicon Valley — if not Washington — Apple is being hailed for digging in its heels on a court order requiring it to aid the Federal Bureau of Investigation in gaining access to an an iPhone used by one of the attackers in the December mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, emphasized on Tuesday in a letter to customers that helping the F.B.I. essentially hack into one of the company’s own phones would be a dangerous precedent. What’s more, Apple said it would have to create new software to do this. But while company executives have embraced the notion that Apple is no longer able to intervene for law enforcement when investigators want access to an iPhone, it has repeatedly cooperated with court orders for access to online services like its iCloud. That may sound like hypocrisy, but to people familiar with how Apple’s products and services work, it is simply a matter of technology. ICloud is an Internet service Apple customers can use to back up information that is stored on their devices. It is helpful if your phone, tablet or computer is lost or badly damaged. And it, like other online services, is a gold mine for law enforcement — as the government spying revelations by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden showed. Every few months for the last few years, tech giants like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter have published transparency reports, which are lists of instances in which a company turned over data on users at the behest of a court order in the United States or other countries.In its most recent report, covering the first six months of 2015, Apple received nearly 11,000 requests from government agencies around the world regarding information on roughly 60,000 devices. Apple provided some data in roughly 7,100 of those requests, the report said.Apple has stated repeatedly that it would hand over data to comply with a court order when it is technically able to do so. And as that report indicates, it has. Often.But the operative phrase to understand the difference between Apple’s cooperation and its resistance is “technically able.”In the fall of 2014, with an update to its iOS software, Apple switched off its ability to retrieve data from its phones and tablets. By doing this, Apple tried to take itself out of the equation when law enforcement is looking for access to a phone. In essence, the company could no longer fulfill a request if it was technically unable to do so.ICloud is a different story. Apple encrypts that data on its servers and holds on to the key, which it uses to gain access to the data when it is required to do so by a court order.There are practical reasons for managing security in the cloud differently from on an iPhone. ICloud exists, in part, to save backups in the event that, say, you drop your phone in a swimming pool. Apple needs to have that key to get your data back for you.It is not so easy for a company to take away its ability to gain access to your information when that company’s ability to retrieve your information is the reason you are using its service.Uber Driver Held in Killing Spree as Police Probe Tie to Routes: A driver for Uber may have picked up passengers in between incidents as he drove around and shot at least six people dead over the span of several hours, according to police in Kalamazoo, Michigan. While there have been other incidents of misconduct by Uber drivers, the Michigan shooting would be the first to involve a mass shooting. In order to become an Uber driver, Dalton would have undergone, and passed, a background check. Uber said it’s referring inquiries regarding the routes to police given that there is an active investigation. “We are horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence,” Joe Sullivan, Uber’s chief security officer, said in a statement. “We have reached out to the police to help with their investigation in any way that we can.” Yahoo launches auction process as Starboard gears up for fight: Yahoo Inc officially launched the sale of its core business on Friday, a move seen as a positive step for frustrated investors but not enough to keep an activist hedge fund from pursuing a proxy fight against the struggling Internet company.Yahoo shares jumped after the company announced its board has formed a committee of independent directors to explore strategic alternatives, and that it has hired investment banks and a law firm to run the process. The launch of the auction process, a move activist hedge fund Starboard Value and other shareholders have pushed since late last year, showed the company was moving another step closer to selling its core business, which includes search, mail and news sites, rather than spin it off as previously planned. The move follows more than three years of effort by CEO Marissa Mayer to turn around Yahoo by focusing on mobile apps and trying to boost advertising revenue.  Yahoo had acknowledged during its earnings last month that it was open to exploring options for its core business. Despite the launch, Starboard's founder Jeffrey Smith is not backing down, and will continue his pursuit of nominating a group of directors for the Yahoo board, people familiar with the matter said.This glove could make eating easier for those with Parkinson’s disease: Eating can be difficult and embarrassing for those with tremors, but GyroGear thinks it has a solution for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease or essential tremor. The start-up has created a glove that steadies a person’s hand, making it easier to complete everyday tasks such as eating. The glove’s power lies in a bronze disc on the back of the hand, which weighs about as much as a roll of nickels. It spins at up to 20,000 rotations per minute, providing a steadying force. The force of the battery-powered disc is akin to putting one’s hand in molasses. While moving is not as easy, the benefit is that much of the shaking is naturally filtered out. GyroGear is aiming to reduce tremors by 70 percent. In one lab test, the London-based researchers say, it reduced a tremor by 90 percent. GyroGear founder Faii Ong was inspired by a 103-year-old hospital patient who couldn’t eat without spilling food. While cleaning her up, the medical student at Imperial College started to brainstorm solutions.  Ong cautions that there’s still work to be done. The glove hasn’t been tested by outside parties, but they plan to publish their findings in a peer-reviewed journal by the end of the year. They also hope to begin selling the product by year’s end and are raising funds from investors. “The idea of simple, wearable devices to treat tremor and to avoid the side effects from medications or alternatively the dangers of surgery is very appealing to patients and health care providers,” said Michael S. Okun, medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation. “The GyroGlove is an interesting idea, however many of these types of devices fall short of the expectations — especially when faced with very severe and disabling tremor.” There are other efforts to use mechanical solutions to aid those with Parkinson’s disease. Lift Labs, a start-up that Google acquired in 2014, has devised a vibrating spoon and fork to counteract tremors and make eating easier. While having shown promise for mild tremors, Okun said it hasn’t proven the most effective solution for more severe cases. In the long term GyroGear is interested in adapting its glove to other uses, such as for surgeons, physical therapists, photographers or anyone seeking to keep a steady hand.Uber is profitable in the US, but is losing $1 billion a year to compete in China: Uber is burning through more than a billion dollars a year in China as it wages a fierce price war against local rival Didi Kuaidi, its chief executive said. The company's Chinese business boosted its valuation last month to more than $8 billion after raising more than $1 billion in its latest funding round, but the U.S. ride-hailing app is not yet profitable in mainland China because of the intense competition. \"We're profitable in the USA, but we're losing over $1 billion a year in China,\" Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told Canadian technology platform Betakit.  \"We have a fierce competitor that's unprofitable in every city they exist in, but they're buying up market share. I wish the world wasn't that way.\"  The $1 billion figure was confirmed by Uber officials in China in an email to Reuters on Thursday. Uber and China's Didi Kuaidi, backed by Chinese technology giants Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, have both spent heavily to subsidise fares to gain market share, betting on China's Internet-linked transport market becoming the world's biggest.Secondary Shops Flooded With Unicorn Sellers: Until recently, shares of some of the highest-flying unicorn companies have been so hard to come by that secondary buyers have battled each other, not to mention other investors, to acquire some of the startups’ common shares. As the fortunes of billion-dollar companies like Evernote have fizzled, however, so has their shareholders’ enthusiasm. Says the cofounder of one secondary shop who asked not to be named, “We aren’t seeing huge discounts yet in the top 10 names, but people are trying to dump them. It’s not just one person calling you about a particular company. It’s four.” Says another secondary investor, who also asked not to be identified for this story, “We’re seeing an enormous uptick in inbound selling interest.” The situation is changing so quickly that several people with whom we spoke say a number of new characters are now peddling shares of so-called “A List” companies whose shares would have been beyond nearly anyone’s reach six months ago. “We’re seeing a lot of sketchy people advertising these deals,” says one insider. It didn’t used to be like this. Just a year ago, demand for unicorn stock was at an unprecedented level, as were the number of companies establishing billion-dollar valuations for themselves. Unicorn coverage became a cottage industry unto itself, with tech outlets and even data analysis firms poring over which unicorns were the best employers, which companies were positioned to become unicorns, and which venture firms were the best at spotting unicorns early on, among other angles. Alas, by late August, China’s market was in a nose-drive, and both late-and early-stage investors began applying the brakes. It wasn’t long before non-traditional venture investors like Fidelity and Blackrock were slashing the valuations of some of the startups in the portfolio. A parade of well-reported WSJ pieces about what isn’t quite right at high-flying Theranos seemed to cement what many had started to think: That many unicorns really weren’t worth what their ambitious investors had settled on. (It didn’t help when, last week, the human resources startup Zenefits asked its CEO to resign over sloppy and possibly damning business practices. Ten months ago, the company was valued at $4.5 billion by investors.) Partly, such nervousness owes to employees, some of whom are getting laid off as companies cut back on costs in order to lengthen their runway. These former staffers have to exercise their options within 90 days or else lose them, and they’re calling secondary firms for help in figuring out what to do. Some sellers are venture capital firms that thought they could exit some of their investments in 2016 and are now concluding that they can’t. (As some readers will know, the clock is always ticking on a venture fund. Most have 10 or 11 years, tops, to invest in startups and get some cash back to investors before losing the confidence of those backers.)Scientists created a three-armed cyborg to play the drums like no human can: Georgia Tech researchers have built a robotic arm that attaches to a drummer’s shoulder and plays along. This allows drummers — now equipped with three arms — to play sequences that two-armed humans can’t even attempt. “It’s a richer and more sophisticated rhythm because you can hit one more thing,” said Gil Weinberg, director of the Center for Music Technology at Georgia Tech. The robotic arm is capable of hitting a drum up to 20 times per second, a rate that’s impossible for humans. And it never needs a break. The computerized arm listens to the sound of the human playing and improvises to accompany the beat. Currently it can’t be programmed to play specific songs. The robotic arm will generally mirror the volume and speed that the human is playing. Weinberg stopped short of saying the three-armed solution is presently better than what a drummer can do with two hands. The arm, finalized last week, hasn’t been tested yet to see how it complements professional drummers. Weinberg’s next step is having drummers wear a brain-scanning headband, and see whether the robotic arm can interpret their intentions and play exactly what they desire. Since 2006, he has worked to create memorable music through artificial intelligence. In one project, Weinberg built a robotic prosthesis for a drummer who lost an arm in an accident.Zenefits Scandal Highlights Perils of Hypergrowth at Start-Ups: Zenefits may be among the first of several cautionary tales to highlight a sobering lesson: For a start-up, growing too quickly can produce just as spectacular a failure as growing too slowly. Zenefits is a three-year-old company that makes software for small businesses. In its short life span, it has been called both the most unsexy company in tech, and one of the most promising.Its investors have argued that Zenefits, which makes money by acting as a health-insurance brokerage firm for its customers, has the potential to cut the red tape that small businesses have to battle to provide benefits for their employees.These grand promises were bolstered by Zenefits’ early growth. Its annual recurring revenue — an accounting measure preferred by subscription-based software companies — reached $1 million by the end of 2013, the year Zenefits was founded. Recurring revenue hit $20 million by late 2014, and was projected to reach $100 million by late 2015. The exponential growth was catnip to investors. The start-up raised $500 million last year at a $4 billion valuation, one of the largest financing rounds in a year of mega-fundings. At one point, Andreessen Horowitz, Silicon Valley’s pre-eminent venture firm, had invested more in Zenefits than in any other company. In total, Zenefits has raised about $581 million. Then, last week, poof. Zenefits announced that Parker Conrad, its co-founder and chief executive, had resigned. In emails to employees, David O. Sacks, the former chief operating officer and new chief executive, explained that Mr. Conrad had overseen a company that had become derelict in its culture and ethics. Zenefits has sought to paint the executive changes as a new beginning. One person close to the company said when Mr. Sacks briefed employees on Mr. Conrad’s exit last week, there were celebrations and tears of relief at the San Francisco headquarters of Zenefits.  Yet the story is more complicated than the single instance of a founder’s misdeeds. Zenefits’ recklessness seems to have been merely the worst symptom of a larger sickness that infected the company, according to investors, former employees and others who worked with the management team (and who all requested anonymity because no one in Silicon Valley wants to be seen as kicking a start-up when it’s down).  That sickness: Zenefits was a company consumed by impossible expectations. In return for fund-raising at a stratospheric value, Mr. Conrad promised the moon to investors. Then, to reach the moon, he began to transform a tiny start-up into a mighty rocket ship — only to watch it careen out of control as it stretched to accomplish the impossible. Though many noticed trouble, neither Mr. Conrad, nor the board of directors, nor anyone else in management could afford to stop, take a breath and fix the problems. Growth was the only imperative.Cybersecurity concerns - Why US Naval Academy students are learning to sail by the stars for the first time in a decade: batteries run out, systems get hacked, and even advanced technology can be balky. In a pinch — or in a war — sailors need something to fall back on. And stars and sextants have been working pretty well for hundreds of years. So the Naval Academy started teaching its sailors how to navigate ships by looking to the heavens again this academic year. The training was dropped altogether in 2006. “I thought that we had computers and all that for navigation,” Hogan, 20, a Charleston, S.C., native said this week during a class on the subject. But amid concerns about cyberattacks and new weapons that can shut off the electricity of a ship or a plane, the Naval Academy made celestial navigation a requirement for third-year students. “Redundancy is the best policy,” said Lt. Alex Reardon, who taught three sections of the class. Especially because, when it comes to a Navy ship on the open seas, “we’re typically alone in what we do.” That could be a major problem in the event of a cyberattack, said Salvatore Mercogliano, an assistant professor focused on naval history at Campbell University and a former merchant mariner. During World War II, the U.S. began using land-based radio beacons known as the LORAN system to help guide ships. And the space race helped further celestial navigation’s decline: The Navy sponsored the development of the first operational satellite navigation system, dubbed TRANSIT, which went into active service in 1964 — providing navigation assistance for naval submarines and surface vessels. But TRANSIT was retired in the mid-’90s after the Air Force completed the modern GPS system, which uses dozens of satellites circling the globe.Virtual Reality Companies Look to Science Fiction for Their Next Play: Tech companies have spent years developing better, cheaper devices to immerse people in digital worlds. Yet they are still figuring out how to make virtual reality the kind of technology that people cannot live without. So for inspiration, they are turning to science fiction. At Oculus, a leading virtual reality company, a copy of the popular sci-fi novel “Ready Player One” is handed out to new hires. Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality start-up, has hired science fiction and fantasy writers. The name of Microsoft’s HoloLens headset is a salute to the holodeck, a simulation room from “Star Trek.” “Like many other people working in the tech space, I’m not a creative person,” said Palmer Luckey, 23, a co-founder of Oculus, which was bought by Facebook for $2 billion in 2014. “It’s nice that science fiction exists because these are really creative people figuring out what the ultimate use of any technology might be. They come up with a lot of incredible ideas.” Those ideas are especially relevant now, as some of the biggest technology companies are nearing a major push of a new generation of virtual reality products. In the next few months, virtual reality headsets from Oculus, Sony and HTC go on sale. Venture capital money is pouring into the industry. But how people will interact with the imaginary worlds remains largely unknown territory. And that is where science fiction comes in. Science fiction is shaping the language companies are using to market the technology, influencing the types of experiences made for the headsets and even defining long-term goals for developers. “Science fiction, in simplest terms, sets you free,” said Ralph Osterhout, chief executive of the Osterhout Design Group, which builds augmented reality glasses. Techies do not need any encouragement from their employers to read or watch science fiction, long a pillar of geek culture. The genre has influenced many corners of technology, from smartphones to robotics to space exploration. But there is something unique about the interplay between science fiction and virtual reality, a technology that is essentially an instrument for fooling people into believing they are someplace — and often someone — they are not. Virtual reality is a medium, like television or video games, that can borrow liberally from the virtual worlds experienced by fictional characters. Magic Leap, based in Dania Beach, Fla., and which counts Google as one of its big investors, has gone even further than most companies by hiring three science fiction and fantasy writers on staff. Its most famous sci-fi recruit is Neal Stephenson, who depicted the virtual world of the Metaverse in his seminal 1992 novel “Snow Crash.” In an interview, Mr. Stephenson — whose title is chief futurist — declined to say what he was working on at Magic Leap, describing it as one of several “content projects” underway at the company.How to write emails if you want people to actually respond:  Having trouble getting replies to your emails? Apparently, one of the best ways to get a reply is to write as if you're 9 years old. That's according to the makers of the Boomerang mail plug-in, who found that writing at a third-grade reading level seems to be the right level of complexity for the average message, after mining their user data for information on what kind of writing actually gets replies. Here's a full list of the tips from the makers of Boomerang: Use shorter sentences with simpler words. A 3rd grade reading level works best. Include 1-3 questions in your email. Make sure you include a subject line! Aim for 3-4 words. Use a slightly positive or slightly negative tone. Both outperform a completely neutral tone. Take a stand! Opinionated messages see higher response rates than objective ones. Write enough, but not too much. Try to keep messages between 50-125 words.After Zenefits, Will VCs Rein in Their Unicorns? The $4.5 billion benefits startup moved fast and broke things—maybe even the law: In a Feb. 1 meeting at its blandly luxurious Sand Hill Road offices, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz urged the chief executive officer of one of its most prized and promising companies to resign. Zenefits makes software designed to simplify and automate such HR tasks as health insurance signups. At three years old, it’s valued at $4.5 billion and is one of the fastest-growing business software companies ever. Under founding CEO Parker Conrad, it also made software that allowed its employees to skirt state regulatory requirements, the company now admits. Days after Chief Operating Officer David Sacks gave that information to Lars Dalgaard, an Andreessen partner who sits on Zenefits’ board, Conrad was out, say three people familiar with the matter. At Conrad’s suggestion, they replaced him with Sacks, a Silicon Valley fixture who’s worked at Microsoft and co-founded Yammer, the business chat company. In Zenefits’ early days, the people say, Conrad created a deceptive program called “the Macro,” which made it look like employees were watching legally mandated online training when they weren’t. Workers who claimed to have completed the training may have been well short of the required 52 hours. Conrad used it himself, the people say. California regulators are investigating Zenefits’ use of the Macro, as well as whether its employees had licenses when they started selling insurance. On Feb. 8, Sacks announced Conrad’s resignation in an internal e-mail. “For us, compliance is like oxygen. Without it, we die,” Sacks wrote. “Many of our internal processes, controls, and actions around compliance have been inadequate, and some decisions have just been plain wrong. As a result, Parker has resigned.” Conrad declined to comment. Zenefits’ financial issues were discussed during the Feb. 1 board meeting. Andreessen co-founder Ben Horowitz, who isn’t a Zenefits director, attended. But two people close to the post-Conrad Zenefits say the Macro, not sales misses, was responsible for the CEO’s resignation. At the meeting, Conrad tentatively agreed to resign, relinquish his board seat, and make Sacks CEO, say three people close to the company. People close to Conrad now say he’s agitated by how Sacks’s very public letters to employees have characterized his departure and blamed him for Zenefits’ compliance problems. The accusations that unlicensed Zenefits brokers were selling insurance became public on Nov. 25 when BuzzFeed reporter Will Alden began publishing articles on the matter. California and Washington state are investigating Zenefits’ sales. The company says it’s cooperating with those probes and conducting its own, and it’s hired PricewaterhouseCoopers for a third-party assessment. Sacks declined to comment. Two people close to Sacks say he first began to worry about the Macro’s possible criminal implications in late January, after receiving new information from the internal investigation. To verify that an insurance sales applicant has completed the 52 hours of training, California requires a signature that carries a perjury charge if violated.After Nearly Going Pop, Google’s Project Loon Heads Into Carrier Testing This Year:  Google’s “moonshot” to deliver Internet to remote parts of the world using high-flying balloons has survived a brutal development phase, and will enter testing with carriers in Indonesia and elsewhere this year. But Project Loon almost didn’t make it. Google struggled to find a balloon design that could be inexpensive and durable enough to not only float but navigate to predictably travel through the stratosphere. “We busted a lot of balloons,” said Astro Teller, head of Alphabet’s X unit (formerly Google X), showing off some of the designs to the crowd at the annual TED conference, which kicked off Monday in Vancouver. There were shiny balloons and round balloons and balloons that looked like giant pillows. But eventually the company found a design that could be made cheaply and still navigate precisely. That balloon, Teller said, last year travelled around the world 19 times over 187 days. “So we are going to keep going,” Teller said, noting that what was once a slow connection has advanced enough to deliver about 15 megabits-per-second Internet access, which he pointed out is enough to deliver video — such as a live broadcast of his TED talk. The next step will be seeing how it works delivering real Internet service to consumers. In addition to Indonesia, Alphabet has reached a deal with the Sri Lankan government to exchange access to needed radio frequency spectrum for a stake in the project. Alphabet is in talks with carriers around the world, Teller said, adding that the prospect is very real and that a further five billion people will have Internet access within five to 10 years. On the TED stage, Teller also talked about two moonshots that Google abandoned. The first, he said, was vertical farming, which would have used one-tenth the water and one one-hundreth of the land demanded by traditional agriculture. But although Google grew some lettuce, it never managed to grow staple crops like grain or rice. Another effort would have allowed landlocked countries to ship goods far more cheaply using a rocket-like air cargo ship that could land without a runway. The idea itself might have worked, Teller said, but just building the first unit would have cost $200 million. Even for a company with Google’s riches, that proved too much to gamble. “If there is an Achilles’ heel in one of our projects, we want to know it right now,” Teller said.India's Snapdeal raises $200 million led by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan:Indian online marketplace Snapdeal has raised $200 million in a fresh funding round led by Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, the company said. The latest fund-raising follows $500 million raised last August in a round led by Alibaba, SoftBank and Foxconn.Creating a Computer Voice That People Like: The challenge of creating a computer “personality” is now one that a growing number of software designers are grappling with as computers become portable and users with busy hands and eyes increasingly use voice interaction.Machines are listening, understanding and speaking, and not just computers and smartphones. Voices have been added to a wide range of everyday objects like cars and toys, as well as household information “appliances” like the home-companion robots Pepper and Jibo, and Alexa, the voice of the Amazon Echo speaker device. A new design science is emerging in the pursuit of building what are called “conversational agents,” software programs that understand natural language and speech and can respond to human voice commands. However, the creation of such systems, led by researchers in a field known as human-computer interaction design, is still as much an art as it is a science. It is not yet possible to create a computerized voice that is indistinguishable from a human one for anything longer than short phrases that might be used for weather forecasts or communicating driving directions.Most software designers acknowledge that they are still faced with crossing the “uncanny valley,” in which voices that are almost human-sounding are actually disturbing or jarring. The phrase was coined by the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori in 1970. He observed that as graphical animations became more humanlike, there was a point at which they would become creepy and weird before improving to become indistinguishable from videos of humans. Beyond correct pronunciation, there is the even larger challenge of correctly placing human qualities like inflection and emotion into speech. Linguists call this “prosody,” the ability to add correct stress, intonation or sentiment to spoken language. Today, even with all the progress, it is not possible to completely represent rich emotions in human speech via artificial intelligence. The first experimental-research results — gained from employing machine-learning algorithms and huge databases of human emotions embedded in speech — are just becoming available to speech scientists.Why robots and smart thermostats keep America’s spy chief up at night: Some people are already used to having their personal information exposed in massive data breaches. But the rise of artificial intelligence and connected computers in everything from toasters to implanted medical device could dramatically raise the stakes of digital security. In fact, they topped a long list of \"global threats\" that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper unveiled Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services committee. \"The Internet of Things will connect tens of billions of new physical devices that could be exploited,\" Clapper wrote in his Senate testimony. \"Artificial intelligence will enable computers to make autonomous decisions\" that hackers could disrupt to cause chaos. For the nation's spy chief to place those threats so high on his list is a big deal, and it reflects how deeply concerned the intelligence community is about the potential pitfalls of these technologies. But Clapper also found a silver lining, writing in his assessment that the technology can \"also create new opportunities for our own intelligence collectors.\" In other words, you can expect America's intelligence community to use driverless cars, smart thermostats and automated networks for spying purposes, too. And indeed, in the written assessment Clapper notes that \"intelligence services might use the IoT for identification, surveillance, monitoring, location tracking, and targeting for recruitment, or to gain access to networks or user credentials,\" in the future. Back in 2013, for example, the Federal Trade Commission cracked down on a company that sold web-connected cameras. The privacy watchdog alleged that faulty software packaged with the devices, which were marketed as secure, left private video feeds exposed online, eventually allowing hackers to share links to live streams from 700 customers' homes online. More alarming is the potential for people to be able exploit devices to cause lethal results, from medical equipment to cars. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration warned hospitals not to use one kind of drug pump after researchers uncovered a flaw that \"could allow an unauthorized user to control the device and change the dosage the pump delivers, which could lead to over- or under-infusion of critical patient therapies.\"Apple May Ditch Samsung For Next iPhone Chip: Apple and Samsung have been asymmetric competitors for years, fighting to grab smartphone market share and partnering when it comes to chips. According to a recent report from The Electronic Times, TSMC (the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) will be the only company manufacturing the A10 for the next iPhone. Samsung won’t be working with Apple for the next iPhone. This isn’t an overnight change as Apple has already been working with TSMC in the past. The A9 chips in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are currently manufactured by both TSMC and Samsung. Before that, TSMC was the sole supplier of the A8 for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Using multiple manufacturing partners provide different advantages. First, it’s a good way to make sure that you won’t have any supply shortage. Given that Apple sells tens of millions of iPhones per quarter, it’s unclear whether Samsung alone or TSMC alone can manufacture enough chips for all these phones. Samsung and TSMC also manufacture chips for other phones as well. Second, negotiating with multiple companies lets you get better prices. It’s unclear whether Samsung is more expensive than TSMC, but Apple can drive the prices down as the A10 represents a huge contract. Finally, Apple can pick the most efficient design. TSMC’s A9 was slightly better when it comes to battery life. So Apple might favor TSMC for this reason as well. According to The Electronic Times, TSMC should start production of the A10 in June ahead of the iPhone 7 release this Fall. It could feature a 10nm design. We’ll have to wait for an iPhone 7 teardown to learn more about the A10. For the end customer, it doesn’t change much if your iPhone chip is manufactured by TSMC or Samsung. Both companies implement Apple’s own CPU design. But Samsung’s chip business could take a hit from this failed contract.Delivery Start-Ups Face Road Bumps in Quest to Capture Untapped Market: DoorDash, one of a multitude of start-ups with a mobile app that lets people order and get food sent to their doorsteps, relies on contract drivers like Brian Navarro to make the deliveries. The problem is that workers like Mr. Navarro don’t always stick around. Mr. Navarro began driving for DoorDash and another delivery start-up, Postmates, in Los Angeles about four months ago. Mr. Navarro, 40, who previously drove for the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft, said he had seen plenty of contractors quit DoorDash and other delivery companies during the time he has worked with them. The issue is just one headache now troubling delivery start-ups, which have been among the hottest sectors of start-up activity in recent years. Based on a belief that the companies would succeed once they grew to enormous scale, investors poured more than $730 million into delivery firms like DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates from early 2014 through the first half of 2015, up more than 1,100 percent from the same period a year and a half ago, according to data from CB Insights, a venture capital analytics firm. But entrepreneurs and investors are beginning to find that the economics of making a delivery service work are far from easy. Good Eggs, an organic grocery delivery service, laid off more than 100 employees and shuttered its offices outside its San Francisco headquarters in August. Instacart, the grocery delivery service, recently laid off 12 recruiters, which the company said was “part of an overall plan to slow down hiring” after a growth spree last year. And DoorDash has been turned down by some venture capitalists as it has tried to raise new financing, according to three people familiar with the company’s plans. The problems are rooted in the high operating costs of the start-ups, which typically act as middlemen between consumers and restaurants or grocery stores. The companies not only have to pay for large fleets of drivers, they also have big groups of employees who receive customer orders from the apps and who then manually make calls to the restaurants to order food. At the same time, to attract customers, many of the start-ups offer introductory prices and discounts, often making delivery free for first-time users. As DoorDash’s experience with drivers shows, the start-ups’ costs don’t necessarily decline over time. For some drivers, who are paid a fee per delivery, it can be difficult to make enough deliveries in an hour to make it financially worthwhile for them. And when drivers move on, the companies must spend again to recruit replacements.More Top-level churn at Flipkart: Mukesh Bansal, head of marketplace and a board member at Flipkart, and chief business officer Ankit Nagori have decided to leave the e-commerce firm barely a month after a top-level reshuffle that led to a change in the roles of the company’s two founders. Separately, Flipkart announced that Nagori was also quitting the company. He had joined Flipkart about six years ago and quickly rose through the ranks. Mukesh Bansal didn’t specify a date by when he would leave the company but said he would continue to be available from outside as a mentor to the team. Mukesh had joined Flipkart nearly two years ago after the e-commerce firm acquired the online apparel retailer that he had founded, Myntra. Nagori, on the other hand, plans to start his own sports venture. Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal will back his new venture, said a post on Flipkart’s website.Federal Government Will Treat Google’s Driverless Car System as a Legal Driver: Google’s robot just got its driver’s license. On Tuesday, the federal agency that sets road rules — the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) — released a letter to the Internet giant that supports its interpretation of a driverless system as legally adequate for roadways, a key victory for the critical initiative within Alphabet, Google’s parent company. Previously, the NHTSA only considered humans as drivers under law, because that’s how cars worked until Google came along. Now the agency has said it will consider Google’s self-driving system a driver, too. The letter came in response to a November petition from Chris Urmson, the director of Google’s self-driving car project. Urmson argued that regulators should treat Google’s homemade cars, built without a steering wheel and brakes, on par with human drivers. It’s been a persistent sticking point for the Google unit, particularly after California issued draft autonomous vehicle rules expressly prohibiting driverless cars. Ensuring that its driverless fleet has regulatory approval to get on the roads is critical to Google’s car strategy.Public Markets Are Sending Some Ominous Signals to Private Tech Companies: After years of rapidly growing valuations and additions to the \"Unicorn\" club, a number of private companies have seen their valuations take dramatic cuts. From Foursquare Labs Inc. raising funds at a roughly $250 million valuation versus a former round in 2013 at $600 million, to Fidelity writing down its Snapchat Inc. holding, there's a lot of interest in where private tech companies might be valued right now. One way to think about private tech valuations is to look at publicly-traded entities that might reasonably seen as proxies. Here's a few examples: The Bloomberg IPO index tracks the performance of companies during their first year of trading, and it has certainly taken a tumble. Cracks began to show late in 2015 as many of them fell below their IPO price. Charlie Bilello, Director of Research at Pension Partners, pointed out just how rare the positive performance of Facebook Inc. actually is, with firms like Groupon Inc., Etsy Inc., Twitter Inc., GoPro Inc., and LendingClub Corp. all down more than 40 percent from their offering price. The index is down 30 percent over the past year and 36 percent from recent highs. One company to keep an eye on is SVB Financial Group, which is the holding company for Silicon Valley Bank. This commercial bank serves emerging and middle-market growth companies in the fields of technology and life sciences.You could see it as a gauge of red-hot tech since it has done business with Pinterest, BuzzFeed, and others. Shares are down 43 percent from recent highs and 31 percent over the past year.GitHub Updates Its Enterprise Product With Clustering Support, Updated Design: GitHub Enterprise, the company’s on-premises solution for managing code, is getting a major update today. It comes at a time when there seems to be some upheaval in the company around the importance management has been putting on this product. The marquee feature of GitHub Enterprise 2.5 is support for clustering. With this, businesses can now set up a cluster of GitHub Enterprise servers that act as a single installation, enabling it to support significantly larger teams. “With GitHub Enterprise 2.5 more users can be enabled on one system as teams grow,” Kakul Srivastava, GitHub’s VP of Product, tells me. “We have customers with tens of thousands of developers who need to be able to work together, and this is really important functionality to enable them to do this in a scalable way.” She also noted that clustering doesn’t currently come at an additional cost to GitHub’s enterprise users. This new version also includes interface improvements with updated designs for everything from log-in screens to the look and feel of the GitHub repositories. This brings GitHub’s enterprise product in line with its hosted version. Also new in this version is improved Subversion support — for those who aren’t using git as their version control system — as well as an API for managing protected branches (that is, branches developers can neither delete nor force-push their code to). This new API is currently in preview.Job Site Hired Raises $40 Million and Forecasts Profit by 2017: When Mehul Patel, Hired Inc.'s chief executive officer, began talking to venture capitalists last year for the company's latest fundraising round, they were no longer interested in hearing about market potential or user growth. Investors wanted to know when the job recruitment website would become profitable. Patel tailored his pitch to highlight the ways he'd made his startup run more efficiently while showing that Hired would roughly triple annual revenue in 2016. He forecast a profit by early 2017. \"The conversation had really changed from a year ago,\" he said. Hired faces many larger and more established competitors. CareerBuilder.com, Indeed Inc., LinkedIn Corp., and Monster Worldwide Inc. each control segments of the online jobs market. Monster generated revenue of $770 million in 2014. Although LinkedIn had a rough time last week, the site generated $862 million in just its last quarter. Hired said it has a 2016 revenue \"run rate\" of $100 million. (The number is generally calculated by using the performance during one period as the basis to project a full year.) Hired is cost-free for job seekers, who create profiles listing their skills and backgrounds. About 4 percent of applicants are accepted. Recruiters from companies such as American Express Co., Comcast Corp., and Facebook Inc., pay to target those high-skill candidates and send them offers via e-mail. Since it began in 2012, Hired has expanded from tech workers in San Francisco to sales, marketing, and other professionals in 15 cities. The company has acquired two small startups in Paris and Melbourne to help it continue expanding internationally. Patel said he's constantly looking for ways to cut costs. The startup has moved three times in as many years because it was unwilling to commit to a long-term lease. The chairs at the company's San Francisco office are mostly from Ikea. Patel said he bought a Herman Miller model for his home office from a startup that shut down during the first dot-com crash. \"That's still my office chair,\" he said. \"It reminds me not to let things get too crazy.\"Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad Out Amid Compliance Concerns:  There’s a big shuffle happening at Zenefits today — with Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad exiting the company and COO David Sacks taking over. Conrad is also stepping down as a director of the company. In an email to employees, Sacks noted that compliance issues that have plagued the company contributed to Conrad’s exit. Zenefits has hit significant turbulence, including missing revenue targets according to a Wall Street Journal report, and also running into issues with regulators. Regulatory issues have plagued the company, as has been reported by BuzzFeed. Zenefits allowed unlicensed brokers to sell health insurance, leading to at least one commissioner to investigate the company in Washington State, according to a BuzzFeed report. Most recently, BuzzFeed reported 80 percent of the company’s deals in Washington State were done by unlicensed brokers.Verizon enlists AOL CEO to explore Yahoo deal: Bloomberg: Verizon Communications has given Tim Armstrong, chief executive officer of its AOL unit, a leading role in exploring a possible bid for Yahoo's assets, Bloomberg reported, citing a person with knowledge of the situation. Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless carrier, hasn't hired bankers to conduct an offer and there have been no formal talks, according to the report. Yahoo said last week that it would consider \"strategic alternatives\" for its core Internet business, even as it continues with its plan to revamp the business and spin it off. Yahoo's core business, which includes popular services like Yahoo Mail and its news and sports sites, could attract private equity firms, media and telecom companies or firms like Softbank, analysts had said. Verizon's Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in December that the U.S. wireless carrier could look at buying Yahoo's core business if it was a good fit. Earlier this year, Verizon bought AOL Inc in a $4.4 billion deal to push into targeted advertising and mobile video. Verizon's shares were down 1.1 percent, while Yahoo's shares were down 4 percent in afternoon trading on Monday.Apple Said to Be on Course for Approval to Open Stores in India:  Apple Inc. is on course to win clearance to open its first retail stores in India, a person with knowledge of the matter said, as Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook seeks growth opportunities in a nation of 1.3 billion people. The Indian government plans to push through Apple’s application to set up outlets, the person said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The company is resubmitting the request as it wasn’t in the right format, the person said, without giving a time-frame for final approval. Apple should qualify as a provider of cutting-edge technology, the person said. That would exempt the maker of iPhones and iPads from a rule forcing foreign businesses that retail a single brand in India to procure 30 percent of a product’s inputs locally. The company makes most of its devices in China. Cook is hunting for fresh sources of growth after Apple last month forecast a sales decline for the first time in more than a decade. India now has the world’s fastest-growing major economy and about 220 million smartphone users. The challenge is that Indian consumers tend to prefer cheaper devices, leaving Apple with only about 2 percent of the market. Apple uses re-sellers in India for its products. Domestic distributor Redington India Ltd. has dropped about 5 percent since Apple in January confirmed it had applied to open stores in Asia’s third-largest economy.BlackBerry Confirms 200 Job Cuts in Florida and Canada: Phone maker BlackBerry confirmed to Re/code on Friday that it has recently cut 200 jobs in both Sunrise, Fla., and at facilities in Canada. However, the company characterized them as a “small number” in stark contrast to a Mobile Syrup report that suggested massive cuts, especially at the main office. In a statement, BlackBerry said the cuts come as it continues its turnaround effort. “This means finding new ways to enable us to capitalize on growth opportunities, while driving toward sustainable profitability across all parts of our business,” the company said. “As a result, a small number of employees have been impacted in Waterloo and Sunrise, Fla.” The company later said that it made around 200 job cuts. It also confirmed that BBM founder and longtime employee Gary Klassen has left the company. The Mobile Syrup report suggests that the BlackBerry 10 development effort has been hit particularly hard. BlackBerry recently introduced the Priv, its first Android phone, and executives suggested that if customers agree, that could represent its hardware future rather than its homegrown BlackBerry 10.Wood Shop Enters the Age of High-Tech: These days, tinkering is high tech. The blending of technology and craft in tools like 3-D printers and laser cutters has made it possible for ordinary people to make extraordinary things. And many ordinary people, living as they do, more and more in their heads and online, are yearning to do something with their hands. So the “maker space” movement — D.I.Y. communities to get people creating, be it for fun, for art or for entrepreneurship — is booming. Maker Faires are held around the world. Commercial operations like TechShop have popped up across the country. And tinkering is being promoted on college campuses from M.I.T. to Santa Clara University, as well as in high schools and elementary schools. There’s even a massive open online course, offered by the MOOC provider Coursera and taught by three scientists from the Exploratorium in San Francisco, called “Tinkering Fundamentals: A Constructionist Approach to STEM Learning.” At Rutgers, a bustling maker space can be found in a moldering wood-frame structure on the Livingston campus in Piscataway, N.J. The building once served as the command headquarters for Camp Kilmer, a transportation hub for soldiers mobilizing for World War II; today, the building, still called Headquarters, houses computer repair offices and the division of continuing studies. And upstairs, there are wonders. There are 3-D printers, which can be programmed to create wildly inventive shapes out of plastic or resin (like a decent copy of the Iron Throne from “Game of Thrones” or a bust of Groot from “Guardians of the Galaxy”). There is a laser cutter to etch materials like fabric, marble or wood and cut through plastic. Next door is an electronics shop, with racks upon racks of parts. Close by are drill presses, a router and a key cutter, which Mr. Carter refers to as “our gateway drug,” a piece of equipment neophytes can use to produce something they really need. A common space with couches and a television gives students a place to talk, show off their projects or just hang out.Tesla won’t give this ‘super rude’ customer his preordered car: The customer is always right, goes the saying. But if you’re rude, don’t expect that maxim to apply universally as one man found out. Earlier this week Stewart Alsop, a San Francisco venture capitalist, shared that his order of a Tesla Model X was canceled after he wrote a blog post that criticized chief executive Elon Musk for starting a company event late. Alsop titled his late September post, “Dear @ElonMusk: You should be ashamed of yourself.” “For you to stand up at 8:52 p.m. and not even acknowledge that you have wasted your own customers’ time was insensitive and poor judgement,” Alsop wrote. Alsop said that he’d placed a $5,000 preorder for the Model X and expected to test drive it at the launch event on Sept. 29 in Fremont, Calif. But then the event started later than expected. The invitation noted that doors would open at 7 p.m., and encouraged guests to arrive by 7:30 p.m. A clear start time wasn’t specified, but according to Alsop, Musk conceded in a phone conversation that the event began 30 minutes late. When Musk arrived on stage he opened with what Alsop described as “an amateur slide show.” Alsop, angry and hungry, stormed out before the event ended. In a follow-up post this week Alsop said he’d been banned from ordering his Model X, and expressed shock given critical posts he’d authored on other companies such as BMW. He will be stuck continuing to drive his “irritating BMW X1.” Musk weighed in on the episode early Friday morning. “Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention,” he tweeted.Cisco to pay $1.4 billion for Internet of Things firm Jasper: Cisco Systems Inc said on Wednesday it was buying Jasper Technologies Inc, a startup that connects devices like cars and medical devices to the Internet, for $1.4 billion in cash and equity awards, its largest acquisition since 2013. Legacy technology companies like Cisco have been trying to find paths for growth while new technology developments, such as the rise of cloud computing, threaten their core businesses. The so called Internet of Things, the area Jasper specializes in, offers Cisco a chance to offer cutting-edge technology to its current customers such as telecommunications companies. Jasper connects devices like cars, jet engines and pacemakers to the Internet and also makes a software platform that helps monitor these devices once they are online. Jasper had been planning an initial public offering and had banks to help it prepare. Its investors such as Singapore's Temasek, Sequoia Capital and Benchmark Capital, will now get a chance to cash out without having to brave the rocky equity markets which have seen no technology IPOs this year. Jasper's chief executive Jahangir Mohammed will stay on with Cisco and run a new Internet of Things Software Business Unit once the deal closes in the third quarter.Dropbox May Not Be LeBron James, but It Is Still in the Game: There are no obvious signs of distress at the lavish San Francisco headquarters of the cloud storage company Dropbox, where on any given day, its hallways bustle with upbeat, well-compensated tech workers enjoying the customary trappings of start-up life. Dropbox is not laying off workers or shrinking; it hired nearly 500 people last year, 75 since the start of this year, and it plans to soon move into a sprawling, custom-designed office building for which it has signed a long-term lease. But that isn’t the image of Dropbox you’d encounter in the news media. Two years ago, the company raised a round of financing that valued it at $10 billion, making it one of the most highly prized start-ups of the tech boom. Now it faces a stock market that has turned unfriendly to initial public offerings of tech companies, not to mention stiff competition from publicly traded companies like Microsoft, Google and Box, the similarly named firm in a similar line of business. As a result, Dropbox’s valuation has been battered by a series of “markdowns” from large investors who appear to have turned skeptical about its future. For instance, the mutual fund manager T. Rowe Price now considers Dropbox’s shares to be worth half what they were at the time of the last fund-raising round. So what’s really going on at Dropbox? Is it thriving or dying? Neither one, yet. When you look inside the company, you find something that defies Silicon Valley’s typical straight-up or straight-down narrative: a complicated story of incremental and potentially accelerating success, but one clouded by outsize dreams of yesteryear. It’s a fate that other Silicon Valley start-ups may be facing, especially with the dip in public and private markets for funding tech ventures. Dropbox’s problems have less to do with the strength of its current business than with a delay, so far, in realizing the towering expectations that once surrounded the company. The start-up is like the college basketball star who manages to turn pro but is still regarded with doubt because everyone has now realized he might never be the next LeBron James. What happens to a company once thought to be worth $10 billion when it turns out to be worth only $5 billion, or $2 billion? According to Dropbox’s executives, nothing too terrible — it can just wait out the market freeze and perhaps grow into its $10 billion valuation. In other words, Dropbox can keep working and may yet turn into LeBron. The murkier issue is not whether Dropbox can build a good business, but whether it can ever become the $10 billion goose that investors had once seen it as. Reports of Dropbox’s demise are premature. But so are reports of its comeback.Magic Leap, an Augmented Reality Firm, Raises $793 Million: Magic Leap, a secretive augmented reality start-up based in Dania Beach, Fla., announced on Tuesday that it had raised a $793 million round of venture financing, valuing the company at $3.7 billion, excluding the new funds. The round comes during a race to discover and create the next breakout platform for consumers, which many of the world’s largest tech companies think will be some form of virtual reality. In 2014 Facebook paid $2 billion for Oculus, a virtual reality company that plans to ship its first headsets to consumers in the coming weeks. Microsoft has been working on Hololens, and Apple is reportedly at work on its own efforts. But Magic Leap has drawn attention for the prominent investors it has attracted — Google, Fidelity Investments and Warner Brothers, among others — despite being almost completely closed off from showing the public any of its products. Only occasionally do the founders pop up to give interviews. This most recent round was led by Alibaba, the large Chinese e-commerce company, with participation from new investors including J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Morgan Stanley Investment Management and T. Rowe Price Associates. Magic Leap has raised more than $1 billion in funding to date.Google’s Moonshots Cost Lots of Money, but Running Google Costs Even More: For years, Larry Page told Wall Street he wasn’t blowing all of Google’s money on crazy bets like self-driving cars and smart contact lenses. Turns out, he was right. If the first dual-structure Alphabet earnings showed us anything, it’s that the biggest costs for the Internet giant are not from its various non-Google projects. They’re from Google itself. Case in point: In 2015, capital expenditure — servers, real estate and stuff like that — ran $8.85 billion for Google’s core business. Cap ex for the Alphabet remainder — from the self-driving cars to the Fiber broadband business to two biotech companies — was far less, at $869 million. Operating loss for those units was just north of $3 billion. That is, Google spent more than twice as much on its basic ad business than on its change-the-world projects. The reason? Running core Google is still expensive — particularly the massive data server infrastructure, which remains part of Google. So is its very large and very expensive research division, despite the fact that lots of that work, like its artificial intelligence and VR efforts, end up in other Alphabet projects, such as autonomous vehicles.Evernote Will Shut Down Market, Its E-Commerce Effort, On Wednesday:  Some more news from Evernote — the note-taking app and startup of the same name — that speaks to the company’s current rough patch: today it announced that as of Wednesday at 6pm Pacific, it will shutter Market, the e-commerce platform where it sold Evernote swag and Evernote-integrated office products, in an attempt to create another revenue stream around its more dedicated users. Separately, we’ve also learned that there is another senior departure at the company: Ronda Scott, the company’s longtime head of comms, is leaving at the end of this week. The moves come at what has been a pretty difficult period for the startup. Developments have included a number of senior departures, including that of the previous, longtime CEO Phil Libin; other underperforming products getting axed, and the startup — once commanding a $1 billion tag — among several whose valuations have more recently been marked down by large fund managers. In a blog post announcing the news today, head of partnerships John Hoye wrote that the move is being made as part of Evernote’s restructuring around its core business as a software — not e-commerce — company. Evernote is a startup based around keeping documents in the cloud — and eliminating the need for paper. So when the Market and its focus on notebooks and other products was introduced in 2013, it did feel a little out of left field. A year after that the company said it had sold some $12 million in goods through the store. And today it updated that with other numbers: over 800,000 Evernote Moleskine notebooks, 300,000 Jot Script styluses and nearly 20,000 ScanSnap Evernote Edition scanners. But at the end of the day, it seems those numbers did not really meet the costs of maintaining the operation. So now that Evernote is calling time on all frivolities; trying to get back to the heart of what made the startup so popular in the first place; and driving more premium users — which are up 40% on a year ago, a spokesperson tells me — the decision to shut the Market was probably an easy sell at the startup.Microsoft Plumbs Ocean’s Depths to Test Underwater Data Center: Microsoft has tested a prototype of a self-contained data center that can operate hundreds of feet below the surface of the ocean, eliminating one of the technology industry’s most expensive problems: the air-conditioning bill. Today’s data centers, which power everything from streaming video to social networking and email, contain thousands of computer servers generating lots of heat. When there is too much heat, the servers crash. Putting the gear under cold ocean water could fix the problem. It may also answer the exponentially growing energy demands of the computing world because Microsoft is considering pairing the system either with a turbine or a tidal energy system to generate electricity. The effort, code-named Project Natick, might lead to strands of giant steel tubes linked by fiber optic cables placed on the seafloor. Another possibility would suspend containers shaped like jelly beans beneath the surface to capture the ocean current with turbines that generate electricity. Such a radical idea could run into stumbling blocks, including environmental concerns and unforeseen technical issues. But the Microsoft researchers believe that by mass producing the capsules, they could shorten the deployment time of new data centers from the two years it now takes on land to just 90 days, offering a huge cost advantage. The underwater server containers could also help make web services work faster. Much of the world’s population now lives in urban centers close to oceans but far away from data centers usually built in out-of-the-way places with lots of room. The ability to place computing power near users lowers the delay, or latency, people experience, which is a big issue for web users. The company recently completed a 105-day trial of a steel capsule — eight feet in diameter — that was placed 30 feet underwater in the Pacific Ocean off the Central California coast near San Luis Obispo. Controlled from offices here on the Microsoft campus, the trial proved more successful than expected. The researchers had worried about hardware failures and leaks. The underwater system was outfitted with 100 different sensors to measure pressure, humidity, motion and other conditions to better understand what it is like to operate in an environment where it is impossible to send a repairman in the middle of the night. The system held up. That led the engineers to extend the time of the experiment and to even run commercial data-processing projects from Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing service.Tech Valuations In 2016: The End Of The Line For Sloppy Growth: What’s going on in technology investing right now? Is this another 2001, when tech imploded? Another 2008, when the wider world crashed but tech powered through? Or is it like Facebook in 2012, a valuation blip and a chance to buy? High-growth companies have attracted  high valuations, which allowed them to raise capital, which was then spent to generate still more growth and raise the valuation again. The result has been a self-perpetuating cycle of high burn, higher growth, still higher valuations and a strong positive feedback loop. The slop has been showing up in the numbers. The valuations of public companies already reflect this - valuations of public tech companies crashed 18 months ago. In March 2014, these high-growth companies were being valued at 12x run-rate revenues, but by mid-2014, this had declined to around 6x revenues, which is where it has remained since. The long-expected crash has, in fact, already happened — almost 18 months ago.  Unlike the private markets, the public markets get to rethink investment decisions every day. Over time, public investors either explicitly or implicitly realized that customer economics and the quality of growth have declined and, consequently, reduced the premium paid for excess growth. Capitalism works. The private markets, where decisions only get made once a year, have been slower to react; hence, the dearth of IPOs and the price adjustments seen as high-priced private companies come to the public markets. In 2016, any private tech company where the last percentage points of growth have only been generated at the expense of profit will no longer be able to attract capital at a high valuation. Smart companies will respond by cutting marginal investment, thus raising sales efficiency — even at the expense of having a lower growth rate. We will then see the same feedback loop kick in, but in reverse. Lower valuations will result in less capital being raised, which will result in lower growth and still-lower valuations. In contrast to the rise, the decline will happen much more quickly. Bubbles build up slowly, crashes happen fast. Eventually it will bottom out as growth rates become sustainable at acceptable levels of customer economics. Sloppy growth will be out. Sustainable, smart growth will be back — at least until the next time.Theranos is running out of time: When Elizabeth Holmes, chief executive officer of Theranos Inc., sat down for an interview last month, she sought to address reports that sparked serious doubts about her company's innovative blood-testing technology. “What we need to do now is focus on the technology and focus on the science and the data and put that out there,” Holmes said in an interview for a Bloomberg Businessweek cover story. “Because that speaks for itself.”: Since then, investors, critics, and members of the medical community have been waiting. And waiting. And the news just keeps getting worse. The most recent blow comes from an inspection report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which found that Theranos's lab facility in Newark, Calif., is in violation of regulations on five counts. As Bloomberg News reported, the company's testing center inside a Walgreen's pharmacy in Palo Alto, Calif., has been temporarily shuttered and turned into a ghost town with a sign taped out front saying it's closed \"until further notice.\" The company's response to this new crisis is the same as it has been all along: It says it is on top of it. How much longer it can keep saying this without losing its credibility is unclear, but it's safe to say that time is running out.Holmes and her story of upending the blood testing market were so powerful that Theranos was granted a $9 billion valuation through recent investment rounds and attracted a VIP roster of politically connected board members from outside the medical field, such as Henry Kissinger and William Perry. Theranos did much of its fundraising from 2003 to 2015, in the midst of an inflating Silicon Valley bubble, when billions of dollars in investor money was sloshing around. The environment has become much more difficult over the past six months, and the company may be running out of time.Walgreens Halts Use Of Theranos’ California Lab: More bad news for blood analysis startup Theranos – Walgreens has suspended use of the company’s Newark, California lab, following news the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said that lab posed “immediate jeopardy” to patients. Walgreens partners with Theranos, allowing the startup to collect blood draws out of many of the drug store’s Arizona locations and one in Palo Alto. The blood samples are then sent to Theranos labs. Walgreens sent a statement to explain the action: \"In light of the letter dated Jan. 25 from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to Theranos, Inc., Walgreens said today that it has informed Theranos that it must immediately cease sending any clinical laboratory tests provided through Theranos Wellness Centers at Walgreens to the Theranos lab in Newark, Calif., for analysis. In addition, Walgreens is suspending Theranos laboratory services at its Palo Alto, Calif., store, effective immediately.\"Theranos Lab Poses ‘Immediate Jeopardy to Patient Health,’ Says U.S. Agency:  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has decided that Theranos’ Newark, Calif., facility poses “immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.” A letter sent to the company on January 25th says that the lab has been given 10 days to provide “acceptable evidence of correction.” Specifically, the document cites problems with the laboratory director, the technical supervisor, hematology and the lab’s analytic systems. CMS has not released the laboratory inspection report that led to this letter, so the details of these infractions remain unclear. But the level assigned to these determinations — “Condition-level deficiencies” — are among the most serious that CMS can make. They mean that Theranos’ Newark lab was found to be in violation of accepted professional standards. CMS declined to comment on the letter.China May No Longer Be Apple’s Great Firewall: The iPhone maker is feeling the effects of an economic slowdown in its most important market. China has been one of Apple's most reliable strongholds during its historic stretch of technology dominance. Even when sales began to level out in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, China was a buffer, promising a massive market of newly middle-class customers looking for a high-end, brand-name smartphone. Sales in Greater China grew 84 percent to $58.7 billion in 2015, making it the company's second-biggest market after the U.S. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook showered the region with praise at the time for its importance to the company's future. Apple's reliance on the country is now being put to the test. On a conference call with analysts after its Tuesday earnings report, Cook said the company is beginning to see \"economic softness\" in the region, particularly in Hong Kong. China is no longer able to offset sluggishness elsewhere or counter the broader slowdown in the global smartphone market. Even with the Chinese New Year shopping season approaching, Apple is projecting its first quarterly sales decline since 2003.A Personality Profile of Larry Page: How Larry Page’s Obsessions Became Google’s Business: Three years ago, Charles Chase, an engineer who manages Lockheed Martin’s nuclear fusion program, was sitting on a white leather couch at Google’s Solve for X conference when a man he had never met knelt down to talk to him. They spent 20 minutes discussing how much time, money and technology separated humanity from a sustainable fusion reaction — that is, how to produce clean energy by mimicking the sun’s power — before Mr. Chase thought to ask the man his name. “I’m Larry Page,” the man said. He realized he had been talking to Google’s billionaire co-founder and chief executive. “He didn’t have any sort of pretension like he shouldn’t be talking to me or ‘Don’t you know who you’re talking to?’” Mr. Chase said. “We just talked.” Larry Page is not a typical chief executive, and in many of the most visible ways, he is not a C.E.O. at all. Corporate leaders tend to spend a good deal of time talking at investor conferences or introducing new products on auditorium stages. Mr. Page, who is 42, has not been on an earnings call since 2013, and the best way to find him at Google I/O — an annual gathering where the company unveils new products — is to ignore the main stage and follow the scrum of fans and autograph seekers who mob him in the moments he steps outside closed doors. But just because he has faded from public view does not mean he is a recluse. He is a regular at robotics conferences and intellectual gatherings like TED. Scientists say he is a good bet to attend Google’s various academic gatherings, like Solve for X and Sci Foo Camp, where he can be found having casual conversations about technology or giving advice to entrepreneurs.SoftBank's Slide Leaves It Worth Less Than Stake in Alibaba: SoftBank tumbled below the value of its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. amid growing concerns about the Japanese company’s other assets, including struggling U.S. wireless carrier Sprint. SoftBank’s market capitalization stood at 5.89 trillion yen ($50 billion) Friday after its stock rebounded 8 percent after a four-day losing streak triggered by rising pessimism about Sprint’s ability to pay down debt. That still lags the $56 billion that its stake in Alibaba is worth, according to its own website.  Billionaire Masayoshi Son has struggled to turn around Sprint since buying a controlling stake in 2013 for SoftBank’s biggest acquisition ever. The wireless operator lost its place as the third-largest U.S. carrier to T-Mobile US Inc. and its stock this week fell to the lowest level in more than two years. Its bonds led declines among junk-rated debt Wednesday. “It’s symbolic because it tells you that investors feel SoftBank has been destroying value,” said Amir Anvarzadeh, a manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore. “Son’s pride has been another major issue, which pushed him to where he is now.” SoftBank lists the value of holdings in nine other public companies on its website, including Sprint and Yahoo Japan. The company calculated the total market value of those holdings as more than 8 trillion yen. Facing a Price War, Uber Bets on Volume: The U.S. operation cuts fares while promising imminent profit. It’s becoming a bit of a holiday tradition for Uber: ringing in the new year by lowering fares. Amid a price war with rival Lyft, the ride-hailing leader reduced its rates by 10 percent to 45 percent in 100 cities across North America. In Detroit, Uber drivers’ per-mile rate is less than it takes to cover their gas and the depreciation of their cars, according to IRS figures. “It’s depressing,” says Bill Scroggins, an Uber driver in Indianapolis. “I’m not even sure I want to drive anymore. It feels like I’m doing it for free.” This is the third year in a row Uber has discounted fares in January. It calls the cuts seasonal but says they could last indefinitely. Last year rates never rose again in almost a third of cities; only in two did they return to precut prices. Uber has instituted temporary hourly wage guarantees to limit drivers’ earnings declines. It’s assured Scroggins and other outraged drivers they’ll come out ahead by making more trips an hour thanks to increased demand. That may be what Uber is telling itself, too. A few months ago, Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick told employees that North American operations would turn a profit in the second quarter of this year. The goal sounds less realistic in light of the price cuts. “Uber has to sacrifice profits for growth,” says Evan Rawley, a professor at Columbia Business School. Uber is also churning through cash a lot faster than Lyft, having said it will spend billions to push its way into China, India, and Southeast Asia. In the first quarter of 2015, Uber lost $385.1 million on $287.3 million in revenue, according to leaked figures published by the Information, a tech news site. And losses are growing: In the third quarter, Uber lost $697 million on $498 million in revenue, according to a person briefed on the numbers. Over the first three quarters of 2015, Uber lost $1.7 billion on $1.2 billion in revenue. For perspective, during Amazon.com’s worst-ever four quarters, in 2000, it lost $1.4 billion on $2.8 billion in revenue. CEO Jeff Bezos responded by firing more than 15 percent of his workforce.Google Paid Apple $1 Billion to Keep Search Bar on IPhone: Google Inc. is paying Apple Inc. a hefty fee to keep its search bar on the iPhone. Apple received $1 billion from its rival in 2014, according to a transcript of court proceedings from Oracle Corp.’s copyright lawsuit against Google. The search engine giant has an agreement with Apple that gives the iPhone maker a percentage of the revenue Google generates through the Apple device, an attorney for Oracle said at a Jan. 14 hearing in federal court. Rumors about how much Google pays Apple to be on the iPhone have circulated for years, but the companies have never publicly disclosed it. Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Apple, and Google spokesman Aaron Stein both declined to comment on the information disclosed in court. The revenue-sharing agreement reveals the lengths Google must go to keep people using its search tool on mobile devices. It also shows how Apple benefits financially from Google’s advertising-based business model that Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has criticized as an intrusion of privacy. Oracle has been fighting Google since 2010 over claims that the search engine company used its Java software without paying for it to develop Android. The showdown has returned to U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco after a pit stop at the U.S. Supreme Court, where Google lost a bid to derail the case. The damages Oracle now seeks may exceed $1 billion since it expanded its claims to cover newer Android versions.Jack Dorsey Juggles Twitter and Square, Both Caught in Downdraft: It is not shaping up as a happy new year for Jack Dorsey and his two companies. Even as the stock market’s volatility has dragged down many businesses, Mr. Dorsey and the public tech companies that he runs as chief executive — Twitter, the social network, and Square, the mobile payments company — have been particularly buffeted.Shares of Twitter hit a record low early Wednesday before going on a wild ride and rising 4.1 percent for the day. The gain did little to erase Twitter’s negative trajectory, with its shares off 25 percent this year. Square, which went public last November, fell below its initial public offering price of $9 for the first time on Wednesday before recovering. In total, the stock is down 28 percent this year. Square faces its own set of difficulties. Naysayers have long questioned the profit margins on the company’s payments processing business. Square takes a small cut of every credit card payment it processes, a cut that is split with banks and other financial intermediaries. The company has expanded into other areas in recent years, such as food delivery and capital extensions to small businesses. Square also is dealing with a relatively small proportion of shares available for trading, since the company sold less than 10 percent of itself in its public offering, in what is known as a “small float” offering. Also, many of Square’s executives and major shareholders are still held by the so-called lockup period after the offering, which prohibits them from selling their shares. Companies with relatively few shares outstanding tend to get whipsawed during volatile market periods because it becomes harder to adequately match the small amount of supply for the stock with the demand, or lack thereof. “Those tiny-float I.P.O.s come back to haunt you,” Mr. Wolff of Manhattan Venture Partners said.Why an Ex-Google Coder Makes Twice as Much Freelancing: With a talent war raging, companies from Airbnb to Pfizer are paying top dollar for the services of independent programmers. James Knight recently made an unorthodox career move for a 27-year-old coder: quitting a well-paid gig writing software for Google to go freelance. No more catered lunches, gold-plated benefits or million-dollar views from the search giant’s Manhattan office. Knight is willing to sacrifice those perks because as an independent he’s pulling down about twice as much as he did at Google. Plus, he has more freedom. In March, Knight and his wife plan to travel to Spain and hopscotch across Europe—all the while writing code for a dating app and a self-portrait app, among others. \"I’d rather control my own destiny and take on the risk and forgo the benefits of nap pods and food,\" Knight says. Amid an accelerating war for tech talent, big companies and startups alike are paying top dollar—as much as $1,000 a hour, according to a person who gets coders gigs—for freelancers with the right combination of skills. While companies still recruit many of the best minds, they're turning to independent software developers to get a stalled project moving or to gain a competitive edge. In some cases, the right person can be the difference between a failed and successful product. Last spring, Aaron Rubin hired a freelance coder through recruiter Toptal for about four weeks to help get ShipHero, his cloud-based logistics startup, off the ground.  \"To find someone that talented in New York in three days was never going to happen,\" Rubin says. \"Every talented engineer I know has a job.Son's SoftBank Vision at Risk as Sprint Goes From Bad to Worse: The acquisition of Sprint Corp. was supposed to help Masayoshi Son realize his vision of transforming SoftBank Group Corp. into the world’s most-valuable company. Instead, the 2013 deal has become his biggest setback so far, dragging down SoftBank shares and cutting into the billionaire’s wealth. SoftBank tumbled yesterday to its lowest level since the Sprint deal closed 2 1/2 years ago. Son’s fortune has shrunk by $3.2 billion over the past 12 months, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, as the Japanese company’s stock plunged. SoftBank paid $22 billion for a controlling stake in the No. 3 U.S. wireless operator at the time. That investment has lost $7.3 billion in value, according to SoftBank, and Sprint is now the No. 4 carrier.  At the same time, a slowdown in China brought down shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., SoftBank’s biggest holding, by 22 percent last year. “There will always be fans of SoftBank, it’s just at this moment in time, no one cares --it’s out of fashion,” said Andrew Clarke, director of trading at Mirabaud Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “They have too many concerns about Sprint and Alibaba because those shares are being crushed.”Upstarts Are Leading the Fintech Movement, and Banks Take Heed: Ryan Craine hates carrying cash and finds writing checks to be a headache. He doesn’t do much of either anymore — he mostly uses his smartphone to pay for things. Mr. Craine, a 28-year-old tech support worker in Washington, D.C., uses Apple Pay at the stores and restaurants that accept it. About 20 times a month, he turns to Venmo, a digital wallet for transferring money from one person to another, to pay his share of rent, meals, groceries and utility bills. To refinance his student loans last year, he went to an online lending start-up, Earnest. Mr. Craine’s money choices point to the millennial-led shift toward new digital financial services, a change in behavior that threatens to upend the consumer banking industry. The popularity of the services has left the major banks rushing to adapt, even as they have regained their footing after the financial crisis. Americans in their 20s and early 30s, analysts say, offer a glimpse of tomorrow’s banking market. “Their relationship with the financial system is very different — it’s an electronic one, on their smartphones,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “That can and will be very disruptive to the banking system.” Money is pouring into so-called fintech start-ups. And major technology companies — Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Samsung — are all entering consumer banking, typically starting with digital payment apps. Investment worldwide in start-ups focused on retail banking markets rose to nearly $6.8 billion in 2015, according to CB Insights, a research firm. That is more than triple the $2.2 billion in 2014. In 2010, 40 percent of Americans with bank accounts visited a physical branch once a week, while only 9 percent made a mobile transaction weekly, according to survey research by Javelin Strategy and Research. By 2014, the percentage reporting weekly visits to bank branches fell to 28 percent, while the weekly mobile banking share tripled, to 27 percent.Modi Offers $1.5 Billion Fund, Tax Breaks for India Startups: India said it will set up a 100-billion-rupee ($1.5 billion) fund to encourage startup businesses and pledged to ease regulations for entrepreneurs, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi strives to create the jobs needed in a developing nation of 1.3 billion people. Startups will get tax breaks such as income-tax exemptions for the first three years, quicker patent applications, a credit guarantee program and easier routes to wind up if they fail, Modi said at a government conference for entrepreneurs in New Delhi. The fund will be established over four years. \"The government should not interfere in startups,\" Modi said on Saturday to an audience that included billionaire Masayoshi Son, the founder of Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp., and Uber Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick. \"India’s youth should be a job creator, not a seeker.\"Jawbone Raises $165 Million at Half Its Last Valuation: Jawbone, the once-hot wearable technology start-up, said on Friday that it had raised $165 million in funding at a valuation of $1.5 billion, or roughly half the amount that the company was valued at as recently as 2014, continuing a burgeoning trend of start-ups raising money at lower values than before. When private companies raise money at a lower value than they had previously, the event is known as a “down round.” On Thursday, Foursquare announced it had raised a $45 million round of venture capital — which people familiar with the terms have said was also a down round, with Foursquare valued at $250 million, less than half of the $650 million it was valued at during its last round in 2013. Down rounds are increasing as Silicon Valley sobers up somewhat after a frothy period. In the last quarter of 2015, there was a major investment slowdown; funding to private companies dropped 30 percent from the previous quarter, to $27.3 billion, the research firm CB Insights said. Mutual fund investors have also recently marked down the valuations of other high-profile private companies like Zenefits, Dropbox and Snapchat. Down rounds, like the ones that Jawbone and Foursquare have raised, tend to destroy value for all of the pre-existing shareholders, including employees who own the company’s private stock. It has been a tumultuous year for Jawbone, which is based in San Francisco. The company’s Up fitness band line faces stiff competition in a crowded market for wearable technology that is dominated by Fitbit and Apple, according to the research firm IDC. Last year, Jawbone laid off employees as part of a restructuring. The company raised nearly $300 million in debt from the money management firm BlackRock last April.As Delivery Startups Cool, Food-Delivery Startup DoorDash Eats Its Words in Fundraising Talks: The company lowered its ambitions by cutting as much as $400 million off its proposed valuation to investors. In meetings late last year, DoorDash pitched venture capitalists on an investment that would value the food-delivery company at $1 billion, people with knowledge of the matter said. The company is back on the fundraising trail for that same round, except this time it’s slashed its lofty goal to as low as $600 million, according to the people, who requested not to be named because the discussions were private. If DoorDash closes the financing at the terms proposed to some investors recently, the valuation would be around the same as the one from the last round in March 2015, which was $600 million, the people said this week. The talks are ongoing, and the terms could change again, they said. A spokesman for DoorDash declined to comment. The comedown for DoorDash shows delivery startups may be losing some of their allure. Such businesses are costly to operate and often take on huge losses in pursuit of growth. Instacart, the grocery-delivery company that was valued at $2 billion by investors, raised prices in December, a move it attributed partly to “changing market conditions.” It also cut staff, according to Re/code. Good Eggs, which works with farmers to deliver fresh produce, closed all of its operations outside San Francisco in August.Alphabet (formerly known as Google) Shakes Up Its Robotics Division:  Google’s robotics division has been plagued by low morale and a lack of leadership since the unit’s founder left abruptly in 2014. Now Alphabet is cleaning it up. Over the last two months, Alphabet, the new holding company that separated Google from its collection of speculative projects, has reframed the robots effort, moving it from a stand-alone division inside Google to a piece of the X research division. The company has also hired Hans Peter Brondmo, a technology industry veteran who last worked at Nokia, to help with management. A reorganization of the robots group is one of several recent moves inside the X division, which used to be called Google X but was rebranded with the Alphabet reorganization and recently unveiled a new logo. A range of companies, including tech competitors like Amazon and car manufacturers, are signaling their interest in robotics. X has several projects in varying degrees of completion, but has lately been “graduating” them as stand-alone companies or preparing them for such a move. The life sciences group, for example, is now called Verily. X also recently hired an auto industry veteran to lead its self-driving car effort — called Chauffeur internally — and noted that the project was a good candidate to be spun out. Robotics has gone in the opposite direction for reasons that are personal and practical. The division was created in 2013 by Andy Rubin, who led the development of the widely used Android operating system software, and it has been without a leader since Mr. Rubin left in 2014 to start a technology incubator that helps young start-ups turn their ideas into businesses. After starting the robotics division, Mr. Rubin quickly went on a buying spree, purchasing a number of promising companies, including Boston Dynamics, the maker of experimental military robots, and Schaft, an elite group of Japanese roboticists from the University of Tokyo. But while the companies were promising, Mr. Rubin invested in several technologies that had industry observers scratching their heads about his overall direction. Mr. Rubin originally said that the robotics division would be a 10-year moonshot, and when he was in negotiations to acquire companies he talked about the possibility of the driverless Google car rolling up to your house and the Google robot jumping off the back bumper. Google’s robotics effort stalled after his departure, going through a variety of leaders, including James Kuffner, a Carnegie Mellon roboticist who has since joined Toyota’s research and development laboratory in Palo Alto, and Jonathan Rosenberg, who is a troubleshooter for Larry Page, the Google co-founder who is Alphabet’s chief executive. Many in the industry say it is likely to be awhile before companies, Alphabet included, can get through the many technological and regulatory hurdles that stand in the way of robots becoming a huge business.Xiaomi Misses Smartphone Sales Target by 10% on China Slowdown: Xiaomi Corp. sold more than 70 million smartphones last year, falling well short of its target and prompting founder Lei Jun to tell employees he was refocusing research efforts into “cool stuff” like robotics and virtual reality. The Chinese startup had a stated goal of selling 80 million devices. Xiaomi originally predicted selling 100 million units, but then changed that after China set its lowest growth target in 15 years and copycat vendors started taking away market share. The miss was a blow to company morale, Lei said in an e-mail to employees. “We set a target of 80 million and, before we knew it, it became an obligation,” Lei said. “We changed under this pressure, and everyone’s faces gradually lost all traces of humor.” The smartphone maker was one of China’s most exciting startup stories of past years, with a valuation of $45 billion that trailed only that of Uber Technologies Inc. Xiaomi thrived through online sales of budget-priced devices with advanced components, overtaking domestic competitors and challenging Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. for supremacy in the world’s biggest market. Xiaomi’s market share has been pinched by competitors including Huawei and Meizu, said Jeff Pu, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Co. They are among the Chinese vendors that have flooded the Internet with ultra-thin phones offering similar features and prices to Xiaomi’s Mi 4i and Redmi Note 2. Huawei said it shipped more than 100 million smartphones last year as it expanded in the U.S. and Europe, defying an industry slowdown. Pu expects Xiaomi’s sales growth to slow to 10 percent this year. “With sales growth slowing, Xiaomi’s valuation will be hurt,” Pu said. “It could even face a down round, as investors are less willing to pay.”Uber Invites Developers to Build Apps for Customized Passenger Distractions: Uber, the huge ride-hailing service, delivers millions of rides to passengers. Now the company wants to give people something to do while they’re in the car. On Tuesday, Uber introduced a way for smartphone app developers to create “trip experiences” for riders. The idea, the company says, is to give riders tailored information and entertainment during their time in an Uber vehicle. Uber gave a few examples of how it might look. Upon entering the vehicle, riders could receive a quick news briefing or perhaps be served with a music playlist built to last the length of their ride. “What if developers could also offer users of their apps new ways to enjoy themselves — or get stuff done — while they’re on the road?” Chris Saad, head of product on Uber’s developer platform, wrote in a company blog post. “These integrations help make life simpler and easier for people to get around.” Uber has long been selective about how it works with partner apps and companies. It has struck deals with Facebook, Foursquare and OpenTable to allow users to hail rides from inside the companies’ apps. Uber is also working with a handful of retailers in some cities for its delivery service, UberRush. For Uber, the goal is to make the user experience more pleasant than a usual ride, which may in turn drum up repeat business and affinity for the company’s brand. The company has struck similar partnerships in the past, such as one with Spotify, in which users can select the songs being played during their Uber rides. This approach invites developers to work directly with Uber to submit and test their ideas, but Uber will have final say over whether a developer’s trip experience will be allowed. It is a different, more cautious approach than that taken by companies like Facebook and Twitter, both of which have had strained relationships with third-party developers in the past. The announcement coincided with Uber’s first hackathon in Bangalore, India, where the company is soliciting developers for new integration ideas.Tech Funding Slowdown Hits Venture Capital Firms: Venture capital firms raised less money and closed fewer U.S. funds last year, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association, a trade association. With less capital to invest, the decline from 2014 could signal an even tighter funding environment for technology startups this year. Venture capital decreased to $28.2 billion last year, from $31.1 billion in 2014, according to the report from the NVCA and Thomson Reuters. The 235 venture capital funds that closed in 2015 represent a 13 percent decline from 2014. While venture capitalists invested more money into private tech companies in 2015, the number of investments declined, according to research firm according to research firm CB Insights. This suggests that venture investors are chasing fewer but larger deals. Tiger Global closed a $2.5 billion venture fund in November. If the firm's recent investments in Flipkart, Ola, and Airbnb are any indication, Tiger's new fund will continue to make large bets in late-stage private companies. Some startups, facing a tougher fundraising environment, have decided to reduce spending, cut staff, and focus on turning a profit.Rocket Internet faces new setback with loss of senior managers: Germany's Rocket Internet is losing two senior managers, sources told Reuters, in the latest setback for a company that a year ago was considered one of Europe's best hopes for competing with global tech giants. Europe's largest internet firm, which has helped create a buzzing tech scene in Berlin, seeks to be a launch pad for stock market listings of start-ups ranging from online fashion to food delivery, but has seen its stock slide as plans to float its bigger investments have stalled. Rocket's strategy of rapidly expanding into scores of emerging markets raised the possibility that it could outflank the likes of Amazon and Alibaba as well as powerful venture capital firms. But planned flotations of Rocket start-ups have been put on ice in the past year due to a cooling market for tech initial public offerings (IPO) with investors increasingly unwilling to meet high valuations. Now it faces further upheaval with Franziska Leonhardt, head of its legal department, and Uwe Gleitz, senior vice president of corporate finance, both departing soon, according to sources close to the company, both for personal reasons. Leonhardt and Gleitz were members of the team that steered Rocket through its own IPO in October 2014, since which its share price has fallen by almost half from the 42.50 offer price. Since it started out in 2007, Rocket has set up dozens of e-commerce firms around the world, but all of its current crop are still loss-making - meaning it needs to keep eating into its cash reserves to keep them afloat, and making corporate finance a crucial department.Flipkart, Amazon’s India Rival, Changes CEOs: In a move that has been rumored for some time, Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal has stepped down as CEO of the Indian e-commerce company, the company announced today. He will be replaced by his co-founder, Binny Bansal (no relation). Sachin Bansal will become executive chairman and “mentor the senior leadership of the company and look for new investment opportunities,” the company said in the announcement. Binny Bansal, formerly chief operating officer, will now run the business day to day. The move comes as competition for market share in India’s burgeoning online shopping industry has ramped up between Amazon, Flipkart and fellow Indian upstart Snapdeal. Amazon has promised to invest billions into its India business, which is run by Amit Agarwal, who spent two years earlier in his career working as Jeff Bezos’s right-hand man.Uber China Raises Financing at $7 Billion Valuation: Uber said its China division has raised financing that values that part of the ride-hailing company's operation at $7 billion. Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive officer, discussed the new funds at a press conference in Beijing on Monday. Uber is bumping up against local competitors around the world. Nowhere is the competition more fierce than in China, where Uber faces Didi Kuaidi. The company is backed by Alibaba and Tencent, the country’s two most valuable technology companies. Uber and Didi Kuaidi are each spending aggressively to expand, partly by subsidizing the costs of rides. In a letter to investors in 2015, Kalanick committed to spending $1 billion that year in China. It may have surpassed that figure. Didi Kuaidi said on Monday that it completed 1.43 billion trips in 2015. Uber said it increased its share of the private car market in China to 30 percent or 35 percent as of the end of 2015, from 1 percent in January 2015. (The Information reported a similar figure earlier on Monday.) Didi Kuaidi said it holds 87.2 percent of China's private car-hailing market, attributing the figure to a Chinese research firm. A recent round of financing gave Didi Kuaidi a valuation of $16.5 billion, a person familiar with the matter said in September. Uber, which owns a controlling stake in Uber China, was last valued at $62.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said in December. Uber China’s $7 billion valuation does not include the new cash. Israel brings tech expertise to protecting connected cars: Most cars today are equipped with some level of connectivity and self-driving vehicles are being developed. Given this level of sophistication, protecting cars from contamination with malicious software has become big business. Building on its expertise in technology, Israel is emerging as a leader in the race to keep cars secure and prevent the nightmare scenario of a hacker commandeering your vehicle. The threat appears real enough. Fiat Chrysler recalled 1.4 million vehicles to install new software last year after cybersecurity researchers showed they could turn off a Jeep Cherokee's engine as it drove. Software manipulation, albeit intentional, was also behind Volkswagen's emissions scandal. From its headquarters in Tel Aviv, Check Point, one of the world's largest cyber security firms, pioneered the computer firewall two decades ago. It hopes to repeat that success with a security capsule for vehicles. Connected cars need a two-pronged defense. First, they must make sure nothing bad gets in, like a virus sneaking through a navigation system. Then they have to keep internal communications secure to allow functions like side-view mirrors which angle down when vehicles are put into reverse.Aerodrome Is The First Commercial Airport For Drones: Aerodrome is working with the City of Boulder, Nevada, to launch the first commercial drone airport — the Eldorado Droneport. It’s one of only a handful of FAA-appointed UAS test sites in the United States. The plan is to offer training, maintenance and other support functions for the commercial drone industry, as well as for individual drone pilots. The company already operates teaching facilities in Detroit, Michigan and Henderson, Nevada.Israel’s Best-Performing Tech Stock Hasn’t Sold a Single Product: Occupying a small, second-floor space in the same office park as 3D printing giant Stratasys, a tiny Israeli upstart is trying to sell investors on a future in which physical objects materialize with the press of a button. Nano Dimension is nowhere near achieving that goal, yet somehow has become Israel’s best-performing technology stock in 2015. While Stratasys lost nearly three-quarters of its value last year, the much smaller Nano Dimension rallied 261 percent. Not bad for a company with no customers or revenue. This little 3D printing shop, with 44 employees and a market cap of 193 million shekels ($49 million), has become a source of hope for Israeli entrepreneurs struggling to secure venture capital. That’s because Nano Dimension took an unorthodox route to raise about $18 million and become a public company, while managing to avoid the long, costly process of an initial public offering.  Nano Dimension found its way onto the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange using what’s known as a reverse merger. This involves a private company taking over a public one, bypassing the formalities of an IPO. “We’re selling shares like any other public company,” said Amit Dror, the chief executive officer of Nano Dimension. “It’s just that it happens to be that our case is a public company that’s pre-revenue.”China Setting Up Fund for Its Electronics Industry:  A Chinese technology regulator said on Friday that it would cooperate with a bank to set up a $30 billion fund to support the country’s huge electronics supply chain. The creation of the new fund underscores China’s ambitions to expand its tech capabilities and also signals how those ambitions are being threatened by slowing growth and recent market turmoil. Official accounts of the fund did not make clear precisely how the money would be spent. But given the recent weakness in Chinese manufacturing and lower-end electronics manufacturers, it may be intended as a form of stimulus to the tech industry. The terminology used in media accounts signals China’s bold technology ambitions. Reports about the new fund said it would be used to build a “strong manufacturing country” and an “Internet power.” A report in state-run media said the fund was created to address problems faced by small and medium enterprises that have come under pressure or folded recently because of a lack of funding. The report made reference to recent factory closures, specifically pointing out the closing in October of Fu Chang Electronic Technology, a supplier to the telecom equipment makers Huawei and ZTE. The fund will be created through a partnership between an industry group controlled by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and Ping An Bank. Signaling the importance of the initiative, the signing ceremony was held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse, which is often used to host visiting dignitaries, and was attended by representatives of many of China’s largest technology companies, including Lenovo and Alibaba, according to an official release. The new fund seems to resemble a separate multibillion-dollar fund, announced in 2014, to provide financing and enable acquisitions to increase the size and sophistication of the country’s semiconductor industry.Flashing Red: A day of distress in the financial markets, and of distress sales in the tech startup-world.Distress Sale #1: Gilt’s Unicorn Tale Comes To An End After Being Acquired For $250M: Hudson’s Bay Company, the owner of department chain stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, said today it was acquiring Gilt Groupe for $250 million. The sale still represents a tough end to the story of Gilt. The startup was one of the original darling flash-sale sites coming out of New York. But that whole market has found itself challenged by slim operating margins, its initial popularity waning, and the difficulties of building a large-scale e-commerce operation. Prior to the acquisition, the company had been widely considered to be part of the billion-dollar startup club. But the company struggled to become profitable, and in October last year the company continued cutting jobs (at that time laying off 45 people). The company previously said a few times that it would go public in 2013 and 2014, before putting that on hold indefinitely and raising additional capital. It’s also not the greatest return for its investors. Prior to the sale the company had raised more than $270 million, which makes this look like a deal that will not return the total amount of money that it had raised. Distress Sale #2: One Kings Lane, Once Valued at $900 Million, Is Likely to Sell for a Fraction of That: One Kings Lane, the online seller of furniture and home decor that has struggled for the better part of the last two years, has been running a process to sell the company for several months, four sources told Re/code. The company had aimed to seal a deal by the end of 2015, one of these people said, calling it a “fire sale.” After originally seeking a higher price, One Kings Lane notified potential buyers in the last few months that it was willing to sell for less than the $230 million it had raised in venture capital, multiple sources said. It’s not clear if a deal is done or who the potential buyer would be, but sources say a deal is unlikely to fetch more than $150 million. That would mean at least some investors will lose money and any employee stock would likely become worthless. Several of One Kings Lane’s investors have a liquidation preference, according to venture data startup PitchBook, meaning they will get paid out before holders of common stock, such as employees. The company most recently cut a quarter of its staff in December, including five members of its senior management team. Sources said the layoffs were likely a condition to get a deal done.Distress Sale #3: Quikr closes purchase of online real estate portal Commonfloor.com, pushed by investor Tiger Global: Online classifieds firm Quikr India Pvt. Ltd, one of India’s most valuable start-ups, bought real estate portal CommonFloor in a distress sale orchestrated by Tiger Global Management Llc, the influential US-based hedge fund that is an investor in both. Quikr, valued at an estimated $1 billion, and CommonFloor (maxHeap Technologies Pvt. Ltd) didn’t disclose the terms of the transaction, but two people familiar with the matter said Quickr paid $120 million in an all-stock deal. The people spoke on condition of anonymity. CommonFloor was valued at more than $150 million when it last raised Rs.60 crore from Google Capital in December 2014. The company raised a total of Rs.321 crore from Tiger, Accel Partners and Google Capital since 2011. Quikr and CommonFloor have valuations that seem disproportionate to their revenue. Quikr reported sales of Rs.24.78 crore for the year ended 31 March 2015 while CommonFloor generated sales of Rs.45.76 crore for that year, according to documents with the Registrar of Companies. Despite having generated revenue that is much larger than Quikr’s, CommonFloor attracted a much lower valuation because of the valuation metrics used by e-commerce investors that may seem peculiar to shareholders in traditional businesses.Collapse in Q4 Venture Deal-Making Could Signal End of Unicorn Era: A study released in October found that venture capital firms were raising significantly less money than in previous quarters. Around that time, a bunch of well-known investors — like Union Square Ventures’ Fred Wilson — began saying that the days of steady unicorn valuations were coming to a close. Here’s more cold water: An upcoming report from CB Insights says that VC funding levels in the fourth quarter of 2015 “fell 30 percent amid weakening mega-round activity while deal activity fell 13 percent vs. the previous quarter.” Here are the core findings from the KPMG International & CB Insights 2015 Venture Pulse Report, which will be released on January 19: In the third quarter of 2015, there were 72 $100 million equity funding rounds for VC-backed companies. In Q4, there were only 39 of those gigantic growth equity rounds. There were only nine new unicorns birthed in the fourth quarter, versus 23 in Q3. Deal-making activity in general fell to its lowest levels since the first quarter of 2013. While these numbers are by far the most concrete indicator that venture startup investing is getting less, um, frothy, there have been warning signs for the last few months. December data from Ernst & Young indicated that tech startups were avoiding IPOs, partly fearful that public markets would tank their private sector valuations. In November, a series of valuation writedowns of a number of unicorn startups shaved billions off Snapchat, Zenefits and other high-flying and fast-growing tech companies.Facebook’s Oculus Says It Will Charge $599 for the Rift: After months of teasing the introduction of its Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles, the company said on Wednesday that it had opened orders for the system, which includes a headset and controller devices, with a price of $599. That’s without a computer included — you’ll need a fast one that will probably cost around $1,000. The device begins shipping in March. Oculus also said that in February, it would open orders for a bundle, which includes the Rift headgear system and a computer that is certified to work with Oculus, for $1,500. Oculus is just one of many companies preparing to offer virtual reality devices this year. HTC, the Taiwanese manufacturer, worked with the software distribution company Valve to develop the virtual reality gadget Vive that will be released in April. Similar to Oculus, the Vive requires connecting to a powerful computer, meaning the pricing should be similarly high. The companies have not announced the price yet. And Samsung Electronics teamed with Oculus last year to offer an entry-level virtual reality system, the Gear VR. That device, at $100, requires inserting a Samsung Galaxy smartphone into the headgear because it relies on the smartphone’s screen for video and its computing brains for running apps and games.Netflix Goes Live in 130 New Countries Including India - But China Skipped; Shares Advance: Netflix Inc. began selling its streaming service in India and more than 100 other countries, closing in on its goal of becoming the first global online television service. The stock logged its biggest gain since July, surging 9.3 percent. Netflix went live in 130 new countries, including Russia, Poland and Singapore, during his presentation. Adding India, most of the rest of Asia and other countries around the world marks a major step for Netflix. But China, the world’s most populous country, remains a gap. The company faces challenges in China, where a local partnership is essential given government controls over licensing for online content, and many potential allies already have competing businesses. Alibaba recently acquired full control of Youku Tudou, one of the largest video streaming services in the country, while Baidu and Tencent own popular video services.Netflix launches in India; basic monthly subscription at Rs 500:  Netflix is offering three packages for Indian consumers starting with a basic plan that would cost Rs 500 a month and allow users to access all content on any one device at a time with standard definition quality. The other two higher subscription plans allows users to watch content with HD or ultra HD quality and a choice of 2-4 devices at the same time. The topmost package is priced at Rs 800 a month. In contrast, domestic and international peers in India like Hungama Play, BoxTV of Times Group, HOOQ and Singapore-based Spuul charge Rs 200-300 a month. HOOQ, which was launched globally in a three-party JV by Sony Pictures, SingTel and Warner Brothers a year ago, also offers a bundled deal with Airtel’s Wynk Movies App. A cable TV service, on the other hand, costs around Rs 250-300 a month for a bouquet of a basic set of channels in the country. Where Netflix can differentiate is its huge catalogue, especially English language entertainment content. It is currently offering a one month free look period. However, this comes with a catch. Besides bandwidth issue and cost of watching entertainment content online another hurdle to wider adoption of Netflix to begin with could be its insistence on credit card details even if one chooses to opt for a one month tasting period.Stuff from CES that you may actually want to buy: CES, the largest consumer electronics show in the world, kicked off Monday with a sneak peek at what some companies will be exhibiting on the show floor this week. Even with a smaller sampling of exhibitors, there was a dizzying amount of tech to take in -- everything from drones to laser-powered gizmos that promise to regrow your hair. We walked the floor and picked out five items that might be worth buying if they ever get to the market. There is a catch: Like so much of the gadgetry on display at CES, all of these items aren't for sale yet. They also don't have some of the finer details, such as price, worked out yet either. Parrot drones have been a highlight of CES for many years, and this year is no different. The company is showing off a new model called the Parrot Disco, a fixed-wing drone that you can launch by hurling it into the air like a Frisbee. Ili, the wearable translator: This little translator is about the size of a thumb drive, has one button and is described as the world's first wearable translator. The idea is that users speak into the device while holding down the button, let go, and then have the Ili translate into another language in real time. The whole thing is designed to work offline -- so no connection needed. It instead draws on a database of words and phrases stored locally in the device. Stabilo Digipen: Moving from the high-flying to the everyday, Stabilo's Digipen promises to be the modern notetaking instrument of my dreams. Made by an established German pen company, this souped-up ballpoint reads and learns the way you write and converts it into digital text for you. Unlike other smart pens, the Digipen is designed to work with any kind of paper.India’s most funded hyperlocal startup Grofers shuts shop in 9 cities: Hyperlocal grocery and fresh food delivery startup Grofers India Pvt Ltd, which ran a massive expansion drive four months ago, has shut down its operations in nine cities. The cities where it has stopped services are Bhubaneswar, Ludhiana, Bhopal, Kochi, Mysore, Nashik, Rajkot, Coimbatore and Visakhapatnam. Grofers reportedly withdrew from the nine cities as it didn’t see much uptake even after running massive marketing campaigns. A company spokesperson told Mint that all the employees in these cities are being relocated to other centres. The company’s founder Albinder Dhindsa did not respond to Techcircle.in calls to confirm the development.In reversal of strategy,  Verizon launches auction to sell data centers - sources: Verizon has started a process to sell its data center assets, hoping to fetch more than $2.5 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as the U.S. telecommunications conglomerate focuses on its core business. A sale would represent the latest effort by Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, to streamline its portfolio following a divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. It would also mark a reversal of its strategy to expand in hosting and colocation services after it acquired data center operator Terremark Worldwide Inc in 2011 for $1.4 billion. The so-called 'colocation' portfolio up for sale includes 48 data centers, and generates annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of around $275 million, one of the people said.Fitbit Takes On the Apple Watch With the Blaze - Stock Falls 18% on News: The fitness tracking leader goes for a full-on, fashionable smartwatch. Fitbit has come out swinging by introducing the Blaze, the company's first smartwatch with some fashion sense.  The Blaze isn't a smartwatch that you can weight down with apps or customize to organize your entire digital life. It is primarily meant to be a detailed fitness tracker that can be worn all the time, offering a few additional features for convenience. Apart from interacting with Fitbit's own fitness app, the Blaze can push calendar appointments, calls, and texts, but it doesn't get into the weeds with such things as e-mail or Twitter notifications. The Fitbit Blaze will set you back $200 for the tracker and the rubber strap that's included. Additional rubber straps will cost $30, leather options are $100, and the steel bracelet is the most expensive, at $130. The Fitbit Blaze is now available for pre-order via Fitbit and will go on sale January 6 via Fitbit's larger retailers such at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target in the United States. Global availability isn't yet set, but the Blaze will start rolling out outside the U.S. in March.  After the announcement, shares fell throughout the day before ending down 18 percent. The Fitbit Blaze, starting at around $200, represents not only new competition with smartwatch makers, but also potentially a lack of focus for the company — which investors may be punishing. Fitbit had carved out a strong niche in the fitness tracking market, setting itself up for one of the strongest stock performances from companies that went public last year.Augmented Reality Versus Virtual Reality: Understand the Difference: The Battle Is Real: Although virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have existed in some form for decades, only recently have they garnered mainstream attention. VR is blowing up right now, and its content and hardware advances have been exciting to watch. In a short amount of time, content creators have made some mind-blowing advances in storytelling with this new technology. Brands, movie studios, gaming companies and news organizations are all tinkering with this tool and channel. VR will gain ascendancy throughout 2016, but my money’s on AR becoming the dominant technology in our daily lives. The New York Times recently distributed more than one million Google cardboards to its digital-edition subscribers. YouTube and Facebook are enabling VR online through digital video players. Everything is aligning to have VR hit critical mass next year. VR is the only medium that guarantees the user’s complete focus on the content. There is no looking away, no checking email or text messages and no updating social-media statuses. VR is the most immersive way to tell a story because what happens inside that headset makes you feel something in your head, heart and gut. But VR’s biggest strength is also its greatest weakness. The immersive nature of VR hinders users from interacting with their surroundings. It takes them out of the moment. They can’t walk around and see what is right next to them, look people in the eye or read someone’s body language. VR is a powerful way to experience content, but is not practical for interacting in the real world. And therein lies the major problem with VR. Content is king, no doubt, and providing immersive experiences is the holy grail in advertising. But VR will never become an innocuous part of our daily lives. AR adds contextual layers of information to our experiences in real time. We have seen this future foretold in Hollywood films, such as Avatar, Minority Report, Iron Man and Wall-E, among others. Soon these depictions will become real. However, AR has issues with execution, which tends to feel gimmicky. Remember pointing your smartphone to a print ad to get some poorly made content? Google Glass showed some innovative AR applications, but they were ultimately a failure because the hardware and technology were too broad and lacked focus on the consumer problem they were trying to solve. These examples have shown the promise of AR, but have failed to deliver on contextual utility. Still, the future is bright for AR with several tech companies working on their AR offerings. Microsoft is working on HoloLens AR headset glasses. Developer kits are scheduled to hit the market in early 2016. Google invested in a company called Magic Leap, whose technology beams lasers into the viewer’s iris to activate AR. That future will become a reality in another year’s time. Both VR and AR tinker with our reality — but AR enhances it, while VR diverts us from it, which is why the latter will come to the fore in 2017, with its promise of contextual data for marketers and utility for consumers.Oculus to take preorders for Virtual Reality headset Rift from Wednesday:  Oculus, the virtual reality company owned by Facebook Inc, said on Monday it would take preorders for its much-awaited virtual reality headset, Rift, from Wednesday. The Rift would come bundled with the game, Lucky's Tale, and a multiplayer space combat game, EVE: Valkyrie, Oculus said in a blog post. The blog post did not contain any further information such as pricing of the headset. Rift \"remains on schedule to ship in Q1,\" Oculus had said in a blog post last week. However, the touch controller, a pair of motion controllers, would be delayed and shipped only in the second half of 2016, the company had said. In September, Oculus and Samsung unveiled a new version of Gear VR virtual reality headset for $99.G.M., Expecting Rapid Change, Invests $500 Million in Lyft: The founders of Lyft, the ride-hailing service, have long imagined that the future of transportation would involve fewer cars on the road. Now General Motors is helping the start-up reach that goal. Lyft announced on Monday that G.M. had invested $500 million in the company, or half of its latest $1 billion venture financing round. The funding, which recently closed, values Lyft at $4.5 billion, not including the new capital. G.M.’s $500 million interest in Lyft is the single largest direct investment by an auto manufacturer into a ride-hailing company in the United States, according to data from PitchBook, an alliance that pairs an auto stalwart with the kind of start-up trying to disrupt it. The investment reflects how much consumer automotive habits have been changed by technology over the last decade. With the rise of ride-sharing companies, car manufacturers have raced to adapt to how people can now use each other’s vehicles for rides, which could potentially lead to a decline in car ownership.Toyota Snubs Tech Companies With Ford Dashboard Deal: Toyota Motor Corp. agreed to use a car-phone connectivity system championed by Ford Motor Co. in a front to keep Apple Inc. and Google from dominating control of dashboards. Toyota will introduce a telematics system with Ford’s SmartDeviceLink, an open platform that the automakers are inviting their peers to adopt for in-car applications, it said in a statement. Toyota has resisted offering Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto, citing safety and security concerns, while Ford is offering them as apps within its Sync connectivity system this year. The deal shows two of the world’s largest automakers remain wary about giving Apple and Google too much control over displays that IHS Automotive estimates will generate $18.6 billion in sales by 2021. For Toyota, which is involved in another system called MirrorLink that competes with the two tech giants, the collaboration with Ford suggest the company is spreading its bets on car connectivity options. Ahead of this week’s Consumer Electronics Show, Toyota also said it will equip U.S. vehicles with data communication modules next year that connect cars with cellular networks. The modules will enable a system that notifies authorities when air bags deploy due to traffic accidents.Alibaba's Finance Arm Said to Seek at Least $1.5 Billion: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s finance affiliate is seeking at least 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) in a second round of fundraising ahead of a planned initial public offering, a person familiar with the matter said. Zhejiang Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group Co., controlled by Alibaba’s billionaire chairman Jack Ma, plans to issue stock to existing and new investors, according to the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private. The firm, known as Ant Financial, is speaking to potential investors including insurers and other financial institutions, as well as private equity funds and venture capital firms, the person said. Challenging bricks-and-mortar banks, the Internet-based Ant Financial runs China’s biggest online payment service, Alipay, and controls the company which manages Yu’E Bao, the nation’s largest money-market fund with more than 600 billion yuan of assets. It also holds a stake in MYBank, a private online lender. Ant Financial was valued at about $45 billion after completing an initial round of fundraising in June 2015, the person said. The company may sell shares in an IPO as early as this year and hasn’t decided yet whether to conduct a third round of financing ahead of that, according to the person. Ant Financial may use money from the current fundraising for acquisitions, the person said, without identifying potential targets. Ant Financial has already invested in companies including India’s One97 Communications Ltd. and Postal Savings Bank of China.Uber’s No-Holds-Barred Expansion Strategy Fizzles in Germany: Uber is rapidly expanding its ride-hailing operations across the globe. But here in this city of 690,000 — less than the population of San Francisco, Uber’s hometown — the company recently did something unusual: It retreated. In early November, Uber shut its small office in Frankfurt’s centuries-old city center after just 18 months of operation, mothballing the online platform that had let people in the city hail rides through a smartphone app. The pullback was spurred in part by drivers like Hasan Kurt, the owner of a local licensed taxi business, who had refused to work with the American service. With more than 20 years of experience as a taxi operator, Mr. Kurt said he disliked how Uber barreled into Frankfurt in early 2014, using primarily unlicensed drivers who had not passed the same exams and health checks required of licensed drivers. That low-cost service, UberPop, which is similar to UberX in the United States, faced legal challenges and was eventually outlawed, last March, by German regulators. Uber then tried to recruit licensed operators like Mr. Kurt to build its service within the letter of the law. But Mr. Kurt would not budge. “It’s not part of the German culture to do something like” what Uber did, Mr. Kurt, 45, said over a cup of tea last month during a break in his busy holiday schedule. “We don’t like it, the government doesn’t like it, and our customers don’t like it.” Uber’s withdrawal from Frankfurt is just one of a multitude of retreats by the company — now valued at $62.5 billion — across Europe in recent months. In November, Uber also pulled out of Hamburg and Düsseldorf after less than two years of operating in each of those German cities. In Amsterdam, Uber recently stopped offering UberPop. And in other European cities, Uber faces the prospect of being beaten back — or at least contained. In Paris and Madrid, Uber has been confronted by often violent opposition from existing taxi operators, while in London, local regulators are mulling changes that could significantly hamper Uber’s ambitions there. Uber’s aggressive tactics also turned off potential customers like Andreas Müller, a financial analyst who tried the company’s Frankfurt service after first using Uber on a business trip in Chicago. Mr. Müller said he liked the convenience of paying through his smartphone, but soon turned against the company after reading that it had continued operating in violation of court orders and did not directly employ its drivers, who are independent contractors. “That might work in the U.S., but that’s not how things are done here in Germany,” said Mr. Müller, 37. “Everyone must respect the rules.”Bill Miller Is Misfiring on Twitter Options After Boon on Amazon: Bill Miller turned to an unusual strategy in mounting his comeback as a top stock picker, buying options on hard-hit technology companies to make leveraged bets with a big impact on his returns. The tactic paid off in 2013 and 2014 as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. rebounded and helped lift Miller’s $2.3 billion Legg Mason Opportunity Trust to a top ranking. The veteran manager is having less success so far with a similar wager on Twitter Inc. that he escalated last quarter, when he owned options allowing him to buy $350 million of the stock -- equal to 15 percent of the fund’s assets. The massive wager highlights how some managers are using derivatives to boost profits in mutual funds, tightly regulated investment vehicles that have strict limits on what they can invest in. The technique allows funds to make big wagers with relatively little money up front, though they can lose that money should their bet go wrong. Proponents of the strategy include bond manager Bill Gross, who has said managers need to use leverage to juice up gains in a low-return environment. “You are going to get a much bigger pop to the upside,” said Abraham Goodfriend, founder of Yedid Capital Management, a Miami Beach, Florida-based firm that employs options. “The downside is, if you are wrong you are going to lose all your money” paid for the contracts. Miller bought options on 9 million shares of Twitter in the third quarter, filings show. The drop in value of the options may be one reason the fund lost 4.6 percent over the past month and ranked among the bottom 5 percent of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, though it’s still ahead of 95 percent for 2015. Buying options frees cash to invest elsewhere and allows a fund to bet on a large number of shares with a small down payment, boosting returns if the underlying stock gains. Miller said in an e-mailed response to questions that options occasionally provide more potential reward for the amount of risk being taken than the underlying stocks. “This almost always happens after the stock has gone down significantly, which was the case with” Amazon, Apple and Twitter, he wrote.Few Computers Are Powerful Enough to Support Virtual Reality: VR headsets are almost ready to hit stores, but less than 1 percent of PCs will be capable of running them. Virtual reality has a very real problem. With several technology giants preparing splashy introductions for the first VR headsets in 2016, few people own hardware capable of fully supporting Facebook’s Oculus Rift or other systems. Just 13 million PCs worldwide next year will have the graphics capabilities needed to run VR, according to an estimate by Nvidia, the largest maker of computer graphics chips. Those ultra-high-end machines account for less than 1 percent of the 1.43 billion PCs expected to be in use globally in 2016, according to research firm Gartner. VR headsets, which create immersive 3D environments the wearer can interact with and explore, are poised to be a star of CES 2016. The massive consumer electronics trade show, which kicks off in Las Vegas on Jan. 6, will have more than 40 exhibitors demonstrating VR products, a 77 percent increase from 2015. Taiwanese gadget maker HTC is expected to show off a new version of its Vive headset at CES before releasing it in stores in April. Facebook is still on track to sell its first VR product to consumers by the end of March, Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey tweeted on Dec. 22. “I think the technology has significant potential, but I also think we have to be realistic about how strongly it will be adopted in the short term,” Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst for researcher IHS, wrote in an e-mail. “The hype is somewhat understandable considering the investment some big technology companies are making in VR. However, VR headsets come to market with a number of specific challenges.” IHS estimates that 7 million VR headsets will be in use by the end of 2016. The Consumer Technology Association, which organizes CES, forecasts VR headset sales of 1.2 million units in 2016. While that's a sixfold increase from last year with total revenue of $540 million, that’s a ways short of covering the $2 billion Facebook paid for Oculus VR in 2014. There’s a very good reason why VR demands such processing power: Anything less, and you might hurl. Early VR prototypes caused many testers to suffer from motion sickness due to slight delays in the screen’s responses to the user’s movements. A standard PC game runs at 30 frames per second. But to deliver the fluid, natural motion our brains need to be convinced an image is real, VR needs to achieve 90 frames per second on two video projections (one for each eye). Right now, that means a $1,500 laptop.App differentiates a baby's crying sounds: Why's this baby crying? Well, there's an app that can tell us. It's called the 'Infant Cries Translator'. It was developed at Taiwan's National Yunlin University of Science and Technology by a team led by Chang Chuan-Yu. \"The Infant Cries Translator can differentiate four different statuses of sounds of a baby's cry, including hunger, a wet diaper, sleepiness, and pain.\" An audio recording of the baby crying is uploaded to a Cloud Drive. It's then analyzed in a database of around 200,000 crying sounds Chang and his colleagues collected over two years. And moments later, the results are in......This baby's hungry. Chang warns the app is not foolproof yet. But the results, he says, are promising. So far, according to our user feedback, the APP's accuracy can reach to 92 percent for the babies under two weeks. As for the babies under one to two months, the APP's accuracy can also reach up to 84 to 85 percent. Even for a four-month-old baby, the accuracy can reach up to 77 percent.\" The accuracy rating varies because over time the baby adapts to new conditions. But for new parents, the app can be a valuable resource. With Car-Sharing Service Via, Sharing More Than Just a Ride: The back seat of a Via functions as Joanne Gamel’s mobile office. It is where Ms. Gamel, a New York real estate agent, checks email, calls clients and gets listings, all while being chauffeured to appointments in Manhattan. But the best part of a shared car service like Via is the business she does with fellow brokers who are also in the back doing the same thing. “I’ve gotten at least 15 different business cards from other agents,” said Ms. Gamel, 35. “It’s great for networking, especially if they share their listings or refer a client. I love getting in the car with another agent. And if he has a nice smile, even better.” Inside an UberPool car last month, Tanner Wells met the woman of his dreams. He was riding from a Brooklyn party back to his apartment in Manhattan when she hopped in. “We flirted on the way back to the city,” said Mr. Wells, 37. “She was telling me about some guy she was going to visit. We were talking about goofy stuff. When we got to her stop, she said, ‘It was nice meeting you,’ and got out. The driver turned to me and said, ‘Why didn’t you get her number?’” The next day Mr. Wells created a “missed connections” post on Craigslist in the hope she would find him. (So far, no answer.) Within the last year, ride-sharing services like Via, Lyft Line and UberPool have exploded onto New York streets as an alternative to pricey taxi rides and unreliable public transportation. Their fleet of S.U.V.s has created a new vision of car-pooling that is luxurious, cost-effective and timesaving. Executives are taking them to work. Parents are taking them on school runs. Packs of young professionals are taking them home after happy hour. Compared with taxis, where rides are on the decline, the price of a shared ride is worth the middle seat and constant pickups. A Via ride costs just over $5 for any two points throughout Manhattan south of 110th Street. But convenience aside, these shared cars are also prime breeding grounds for scandalous, titillating exchanges, where New Yorkers sandwiched together are networking, flirting and sparring in a seemingly consequence-free environment where nearly anything goes.Instacart’s crazy-growth days may be coming to an end: the $2 Billion Grocery Delivery Startup, Lays Off 12 In-House Recruiters:  The grocery delivery startup, which investors valued at $2 billion last year, laid off 12 in-house recruiters earlier this month, according to multiple sources. A spokeswoman confirmed the layoffs, but did not disclose how many recruiters the company still employs. In a statement, CEO Apoorva Mehta attributed the job cuts to the company’s plans to be less aggressive in hiring in 2016 than it was in 2015, when its staff tripled, from just under 100 employees to a little more than 300. A person familiar with the move, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said the company likely should have employed fewer full-time recruiters and more contractors since it was unlikely that last year’s pace of hiring would continue indefinitely. Those affected by the cuts will be paid through the end of January, this person said. Instacart delivers groceries in 18 American cities from big chains like Whole Foods, Costco and Target and smaller grocers like Fairway and Zabar’s in New York City. Customers place orders through Instacart’s website or app, and the goods are whisked from local stores to customer doors, usually within an hour. A substantial portion of Instacart’s revenue originally came from marking up the in-store price of a given item, but the company now often charges the same price as the grocer, but takes a cut of the sales from the store. Earlier this year, Instacart finally began being transparent about when it was charging higher prices than its partner grocers.First Look at New Foldable Google Glass for the Workplace: The division of Google responsible for wearable technology, Project Aura, has been hard at work on numerous iterations based on the original Glass headset. Now we’ve got a glimpse at what one of those devices may look like. In FCC filings published today, a version of Glass designed for the workplace shows a familiar-looking device with a glass prism, but equipped with a hinge so that it can be folded and placed in pockets like a standard pair of glasses.Sidecar Squeezed Out by Uber and Lyft, Will Shut Down on Dec. 31: Sidecar, the third-biggest U.S. car-hailing service, said it will end its ride and delivery operations as the company is squeezed out by better-known competitors Uber and Lyft. One of the pioneers of the ride-sharing concept, Sidecar will end its service on Dec. 31, co-founders Sunil Paul and Jahan Khanna wrote in a blog post. The move will help pave the way for the \"next big adventure in 2016,\" according to the letter. Founded four years ago, Sidecar created one of the first apps to try ride-destination tracking, discounted carpooling and deliveries that placed people and packages on the same route, according to its founders. The closely held San Francisco-based company shifted from transporting passengers to goods after struggling to compete with Uber and Lyft, according to CB Insights. \"They’re competing with very heavily funded companies, and they didn’t have the same pull with drivers that these other companies might have,\" said Nikhil Krishnan, a technology analyst at CB Insights. \"Even when it pivoted to transporting goods, it still had to compete with Postmates, and even Uber is transporting goods.\" Sidecar has raised about $35 million, according to Margaret Ryan, a company spokeswoman. That number pales in comparison to venture capital raised by Uber and Lyft. Bloomberg News reported earlier this month that Uber is seeking $2.1 billion in a financing round that would value the car-booking company at $62.5 billion. Lyft, the No. 2 ride-hailing service, is currently seeking to raise $500 million, according to fundraising documents obtained by Bloomberg last month. Sidecar’s investors include Union Square Ventures, Google Ventures, and Richard Branson.Foodpanda India to sack about 330 employees: Foodpanda India is laying off one in seven staffers, continuing its clean-up drive after allegations of operational irregularities rattled the Rocket Internet-owned food ordering marketplace. The company said on Tuesday it will sack 15 per cent of its employees, or 330 people, as increased automation of 98 per cent in order processing has reduced the need for staffers. Foodpanda joins a raft of food-tech startups such as Zomato and TinyOwl in laying off employees amid a tightening in fund flow from investors due to high cash burn and growing profitability concerns. Before the job cuts, Foodpanda had 2,200 employees on its rolls. The company said it will provide affected employees due remuneration and help them explore job options.Universities Race to Nurture Start-Up Founders of the Future:  Ten years ago, it may have sufficed to offer a few entrepreneurship courses, workshops and clubs. But undergraduates, driven by a sullen job market and inspired by billion-dollar success narratives from Silicon Valley, now expect universities to teach them how to convert their ideas into business or nonprofit ventures. As a result, colleges — and elite institutions in particular — have become engaged in an innovation arms race. Harvard opened an Innovation Lab in 2011 that has helped start more than 75 companies. Last year, New York University founded a campus entrepreneurs’ lab, and this year Northwestern University opened a student start-up center, the Garage.

Some of that spirit was on display at Rice in October. In an engineering department design lab, teams of students in the university’s global health technologies program were working on assignments to develop products for real clients — many of them for hospitals in Malawi, in southeastern Africa, seeking low-cost medical devices.LinkedIn Rival Viadeo Exits China: Viadeo, the French rival to LinkedIn, is to exit China in order to focus on becoming a profitable business. In a further cost-cutting move, it will also shutter its data center in California and migrate to the cloud. The company moved into China eight years when it acquired local professional social network Tianji.com, but that site will cease to exist on December 31. Viadeo claims that Tianji has 25 million users, but it has struggled to attract the “very considerable development resources” necessary to drive it forward in “China’s fiercely competitive market”. Viadeo had planned to use one-third of the proceeds from its 2014 IPO to develop Tianji.com, but the listing didn’t raise enough capital and the firm wasn’t able to pull in money from private investors. Post-China, Viadeo said it will refocus on its home market of France and other French-speaking countries, while putting great emphasis on its B2B sales model. Viadeo’s foray into China was a fascinating one, since it doubled down on the country in 2011, a time when Twitter and Facebook were heavily linked with opening local operations there. The company two-sided play — having a global site (Viadeo.com) and a China-only one (Tianji.com) — was a model that both of the U.S. social networks had reportedly shown interest in. In contrast to Viadeo’s troubles in China, LinkedIn seems to be finding some success there. The U.S. social network opened a joint-venture with Sequoia China last year. LinkedIn China isn’t a totally separate site, but it does block some content from China based on the country’s web censorship regulations.Apple Pay Seeks Growth in Asia, Europe After Slow U.S. Adoption:  After a sluggish start in the U.S. since its debut more than a year ago, Apple Pay is ramping up in markets where people are more comfortable with so- called contactless payments. The service, which lets consumers pay in an app or by tapping their iPhone on store terminals, will be introduced next year in China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Spain. Apple is counting on its brand recognition as it enters markets that are further along than the U.S. in all things mobile payments, particularly in advanced technologies needed to accept them in retail outlets. Still, it won’t be easy. The iPhone maker will compete with local banks and Internet companies that already offer the service -- not to mention Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s leader in smartphones. The mobile-payment service, which only works with Apple devices, is a way for the company to make products more appealing and spur customer loyalty. After Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook called 2015 the “year of Apple Pay” in January, the service has been slow to take off domestically, partly because of a lack of promotion and a limited number of store terminals able to accept it. China: Apple said its service will be rolled out as soon as early 2016.   Last week, Apple teamed up with Chinese bank-card association UnionPay, which will make Apple’s market entry “a lot easier,” said James Wester, an analyst at researcher IDC. Still, Apple Pay will compete with services like Tencent’s WeChat and Alibaba’s Alipay that control more than 75 percent of the mobile-payments market. And Apple should be prepared to race with Samsung, which also announced a partnership with UnionPay and plans to bring Samsung Pay to China as soon as early 2016.Jet.com’s Strategy: Low Prices, Fast Delivery, Happy Workers: You can’t accuse Jet.com of timidity. Jet has had some bumps and turns since last summer, when it began selling products as varied as cans of chili, exercise bikes and WowWee personal robots. It changed its business model, dropping a membership fee. It is burning through cash as it continues to scale up, now with more than 900 employees. When it went out to raise more money in the fall, it encountered skepticism. A week before Christmas, it told some customers they would not get their orders in time. Jet said only about 500 shipments out of a million were affected, but such admissions never look good. Yet Marc Lore, Jet’s founder and chief executive, says he is not worried. What will separate Jet from Fab and every other failed company, he says, is happiness. In particular, employee happiness. “I’m constantly asking people at Jet if they’re happy,” he said. “It’s really important for me to know that they love working here and think this is the best place they’ve ever worked.” Jet supplies its employees with typical start-up perks like free food (weekly lunches, plus Red Bull in the refrigerator and protein powder in the kitchen cabinet), four months of paid parental leave, unlimited vacation and an ownership stake that could one day be worth a lot. But it also has some decidedly less common policies, like standardized, no-negotiation pay packages and worker-friendly employment agreements. Employees can see, every day, how the business is doing. “Transparency” is a big word with Mr. Lore. So is “fairness.” Make people feel good, he says, and they will do their best. Trust them and they will reward you. As the holiday shopping season was beginning in late November, Mr. Lore convened his top executives in Jet’s Hoboken, N.J., headquarters for their regular weekly meeting. Here are some of the things that were not on the agenda: warehouse logistics, customer concerns, fine-tuning prices, potential shipping bottlenecks, supplier issues or any of a dozen other topics that could have bedeviled Jet’s first December. Instead, the executives discussed the mood and well-being of Jet’s employees. The preliminary results of Jet’s first “Happiness Pulse” were in. More than 500 employees responded to the survey, which means basically everyone who had been at Jet for at least a month. Two-thirds of them said they viewed Jet favorably. Only 4 percent had a negative opinion. “So only 25 people are basically unhappy,” Mr. Lore said. In an interview a few weeks after Jet’s official debut in July, Mr. Lore pulled out his phone and opened an app. It showed that Jet sold $667,200 in gross merchandise value in one day, up 89 percent in a month. Jet had 6,100 first-time buyers the previous day, and 7,800 orders. The company had $153 million in cash. The app is bulging with data, and it is available to investors and the salaried — but not the hourly — employees. Some information is available even to casual visitors. Dominating one wall in the reception area in Hoboken is a board posting constant updates of the day’s sales by number and dollar volume. For technology companies, this is radical openness. Also radical is a practice to keep salaries the same for jobs grouped together, a process called “leveling.” This is meant to rule out the common ploy “I got a job offer, can you match it?” Extroverts who promote themselves and introverts who keep their heads down are paid the same for jobs of the same value to the company.Common Stock Ownership Spreads Among Start-Up Investors: When institutional investors put money into companies backed by venture capital, they typically end up owning a type of stock called preferred shares. Now, institutional investors are also becoming owners of a different class of start-up stock: common shares. The competition among investors to get into hot start-ups has been so fierce that many hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds and others have been unable to participate when the up-and-coming companies sold preferred shares, a kind of stock that generally comes with many protections. So to make sure they got a stake in private companies like Palantir Technologies, Dropbox and One Kings Lane, the institutional investors instead began buying common stock — generally owned by employees of start-ups — often from workers directly or from platforms that sell employee shares. In doing so, the investors chose to forgo the protections that come with preferred shares. Common stock usually comes with no guarantees and is paid out only after the preferred shareholders get their money. The spreading of common stock may have some unintended consequences, especially as the air begins to come out of the Silicon Valley boom and some companies get sold for modest amounts of money. For one, institutional investors who own common stock could take home much less than other investors in the same company who have preferred shares. That gap, in turn, could lead to more litigation between investors.When a Unicorn Start-Up Stumbles, Its Employees Get Hurt:  On Sept. 4, employees of Good Technology, a mobile security start-up in Sunnyvale, Calif., awoke to discover that their company was being sold to BlackBerry, the mobile device and software maker. Some workers immediately began trying to figure out what it meant for Good to abandon its long-anticipated plan to go public — a move that would have potentially turned their shares in the start-up into gold. They didn’t get firm answers that day, but the prospects did not look great. In an investor document about the sale that was distributed to shareholders, employees discovered their Good stock was valued at 44 cents a share, down from $4.32 a year earlier. In contrast, preferred stock owned by Good’s venture capitalists was worth almost seven times as much, more than $3 a share. The paperwork also showed that Good’s board had turned down an $825 million cash offer just six months earlier, in March. For some employees, it meant that their shares were practically worthless. Even worse, they had paid taxes on the stock based on the higher value. A few nights after the investor document went around, a glass conference room wall at Good’s headquarters was broken, according to an incident report. At a subsequent company meeting, Ms. Wyatt told employees that counselors were available to talk to people who needed to vent. “Many employees may not recover what they’ve lost,” said Matthew Parks, Good’s director of cloud products, who has worked at the company since 2006. His Good shares are now worth a fraction of the six-figure tax bill that he paid for the stock allotted to him before the company was sold. What Good’s employees experienced is an example of who loses out when a company backed by venture capital goes south. While plenty of people — including founders, top executives and investors — are involved in the rise of a start-up, those hit the hardest during a company’s fall are the rank-and-file employees. Investors and executives generally get protections in a start-up that employees do not. Many investors have preferred stock, a class of shares that can come with a guaranteed payout. Executives frequently get special bonuses so they will not leave during deal talks. In Good’s case, the six investors on the board had preferred shares worth a combined $125 million. After the sale to BlackBerry, Ms. Wyatt, who has since left the company, took home $4 million, as well as a $1.9 million severance payment, according to investor documents. In contrast, start-up employees generally own common stock, whose payout comes only after those who hold preferred shares get their money. In Good’s case, the board’s preferred stock was worth almost the same as all 227 million common shares outstanding. Missing out on the upside of the sale was bad enough, but that wasn’t the half of it. Some Good employees actually lost money when BlackBerry bought the company. Good was a unicorn, that is, a private company with a valuation of more than $1 billion. The high valuation increased the paper value of employee shares — and thus the income tax bills levied on their stock when they received the stock grants, or when they bought and sold shares. To pay those taxes, some employees emptied savings accounts and borrowed money. Some of Good’s common shareholders have sued most of the board for a breach of fiduciary duty, asserting that directors looked after the interests of only preferred shareholders.Palantir Technologies raises $880 million from investors: Palantir Technologies, a data analytics and security company that helps government agencies track down terrorists and uncover financial fraud, said on Wednesday it has raised $880 million in its latest financing round. Founded in 2004, Palantir, which is considered Silicon Valley's most secretive company, does highly confidential work for U.S. defense and intelligence agencies. Its data mining system, which uses algorithms to search for patterns and connections, helped the U.S. government track down al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The company's large staff of consultants also work with large businesses, police departments, banks and branches of the U.S. military. Palantir has raised close to $2 billion from investors. Its valuation earlier this month reached $20 billion, up from $15 billion in late 2014, making it the fourth-highest-valued, venture-backed private tech company in the world. The company has bucked growing skepticism among late-stage investors about plowing millions into highly valuable companies. Other \"unicorns,\" or venture-backed companies ostensibly worth $1 billion or more, have watched their valuations come under heightened scrutiny. Palantir's strong government ties and an annual revenue estimated by some at more about $1 billion likely set it apart from other cash-burning startups. The company was co-founded by Peter Thiel and Joe Lonsdale, two of Silicon Valley's more influential investors and entrepreneurs.Elon Musk's SpaceX Successfully Lands Rocket After Launch of Satellites Into Orbit: People living along the central Atlantic coast of Florida have for decades enjoyed the spectacle of rockets headed for space. On Monday night, they were treated to a new sight that may become common: a rocket coming back down to a gentle landing. “It really felt like it was right on top of us,” Elon Musk, the chief executive of Space Exploration Technologies Corporation of Hawthorne, Calif., or SpaceX for short, said during a telephone news conference afterward. For SpaceX, the 8:29 p.m. liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was a threefold success. First, it marked the company’s return to flight after half a year. In SpaceX’s last launch attempt, a rocket taking supplies to the International Space Station disintegrated. Second, SpaceX’s upgraded design for its Falcon 9 rocket worked flawlessly. The liquid oxygen was chilled to minus 340 degrees Fahrenheit, about 40 degrees colder than on earlier flights, and the kerosene fuel was cooled to 20 degrees instead of 70 degrees. Most significant to SpaceX’s ambitions, however, is that after the second stage of the rocket with the satellites continued on to orbit, the engines of the booster stage reignited to turn it around, back to Cape Canaveral. Currently, most rockets are launched just once, the boosters falling back to Earth as expensive junk. Making spaceflight more like air travel, with rockets capable of being refueled and sent up again, is essential for SpaceX’s long-term goal of sending people to Mars. “It’s all the difference in the world,” Mr. Musk said, “absolutely fundamental.”Google, Ford in talks on self-driving car partnership: source: Google and Ford Motor Co are in talks about forming a partnership to develop autonomous car technology, a person briefed on the matter said on Tuesday. The extent of a partnership between the second-largest U.S. automaker and search engine giant Alphabet Inc remains under discussion and the precise framework of any effort is unclear but it could include jointly building and developing cars. The two sides have been talking for months, the source said. A partnership between a major automaker and Google could speed the introduction of self-driving vehicles by giving the car company access to Google's wealth of software development while Google would benefit from the industrial and automotive know-how of a firm such as Ford. Fully autonomous cars could eventually prevent thousands of crashes, deaths and injuries, reduce oil use through better traffic management and extend personal mobility to people unable to drive.Cisco reviews code after Juniper code backdoor found; more scrutiny expected: Networking equipment maker Cisco said on Monday it has launched a product review to look for tampering after rival Juniper Networks's disclosure found code in firewall software that made it vulnerable to cyber attacks. Juniper warned customers on Thursday that it had uncovered \"unauthorized code\" in its firewall software, saying it could be exploited to allow an attacker to unscramble encrypted communications that travel through the security devices. That prompted the code review by Cisco. Security experts said they expect other technology companies to conduct similar investigations after last week's unprecedented news from Juniper. It was the first time a major technology firm discovered the addition of an unauthorized 'back door,\" or code that could be exploited to facilitate cyber attacks, according to security experts. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was investigating how the Juniper \"back door\" might impact government networks.Toshiba Plans to Cut 7,800 Jobs as It Warns of Huge Loss:  Toshiba warned on Monday that it would incur its largest net loss ever as it tries to restructure a stable of unprofitable businesses. The Japanese company, whose financial struggles were laid bare this year in a $1.2 billion accounting scandal, said it would eliminate 7,800 jobs, mostly in its slumping consumer electronics division. That brings the number of job cuts announced this year to more than 10,000 total, or roughly 5 percent of its work force. Shedding workers is expensive in Japan, where the majority of employees enjoy legal protection from layoffs. Toshiba will have to negotiate voluntary buyouts instead, a process it said would contribute to a loss of 550 billion yen, or $4.5 billion, in the financial year ending in March. The bookkeeping scandal has been an embarrassment for corporate Japan. Though wrongdoing by businesses is hardly unheard-of here, Toshiba was among the bluest of blue-chip companies, featuring on a prominent index of businesses believed to combine profitability with clean, modern corporate governance. Instead, it turned out that the company had been massaging its earnings since the global financial crisis took hold in 2008. A committee of investigators hired by the company concluded in the summer that it had engaged in a “systematic cover-up.” The committee found problems in virtually all corners of Toshiba’s business, which encompasses products as various as refrigerators and nuclear power plants. Half the company’s board of directors stepped down. The more than 150 billion yen in profit overstatement discovered by the committee was equal to about a third of the pretax profits that Toshiba reported during the seven-year period under scrutiny.Ericsson signs patent deal with Apple, shares soar: Swedish mobile telecom gear maker Ericsson said it had signed a patent license deal with Apple Inc over technology that helps smartphones and tablets connect to mobile networks, sending its shares up much as 8 percent. The deal ends a year-long dispute with Apple, one of the biggest legal battles in mobile technology and Ericson said it would pave the way for cooperation between the companies on future technologies. Ericsson had said in its filing to a U.S. district court in January that Apple's license to use the technology developed by the Swedish firm had expired, and that two years of negotiations had not led to a new deal. Ericsson on Monday estimated overall revenue from intellectual property rights in 2015 would hit 13 to 14 billion crowns ($1.52-$1.64 billion) up from 9.9 billion in 2014 as a result of the agreement.Uber's Rival Lyft Plans to Raise Up to $1 Billion in New Funds: Ride-hailing company Lyft plans to raise as much as $1 billion in new funds, according to a Delaware state filing, in a round of financing analysts said could sharply boost the valuation of Uber’s largest U.S. rival. Lyft didn’t indicate in the Friday evening filing how much had been raised, who was investing in the round or list a valuation. Sven Weber, a financial filings expert, pegged the pre-money valuation at about $4.5 billion while Justin Byers at VC Experts estimates it closer to $3.9 billion. Lyft was valued at $2.5 billion when it announced a previous funding round in March. The latest fundraising round contained some downside protection for new investors, including the provision of extra shares should Lyft go public at a lower valuation. Lyft is competing aggressively with Uber, which recently filed to raise $2.1 billion at a $62.5 billion valuation. The discrepancies in the valuations reflect Uber’s pole position in the U.S. and its global ambitions. On Dec. 3, Lyft said it was teaming up with Uber’s biggest rivals in Asia, including China’s Didi Kuaidi, Singapore’s GrabTaxi, India’s Ola, to form a global alliance that will make their apps cross-compatible for travelers. Lyft lost $127 million in the first half of 2015 on $46.7 million in revenue, according to fundraising documents obtained by Bloomberg. It said last month it has gained market share in key markets such as San Francisco, and has a gross revenue “run rate” of $1 billion.Alibaba Heads Into 2016 Struggling With Knock-Off Reputation: Cash-strapped Star Wars fans can pick up Darth Vader figurines and light sabers for as little as $4.59. Tom Brady jerseys go for about a 10th of those on the National Football League’s store. A pair of red Beats Solo headphones can be had for just $107 -- about half its official price. It’s bargains galore at Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Taobao: the EBay-like bazaar where buyers meet up with sellers. Billionaire Chairman Jack Ma is struggling to shake the company’s reputation as a haven for cheap knock-offs and unauthorized merchandise, 21 months after calling counterfeits cancerous. He heads into 2016 after a bruising year that saw more than $50 billion wiped off its market value amid lawsuits and criticism from Chinese and U.S. regulators. Cleaning up its image next year is crucial to Alibaba’s goal of winning the trust of merchants and shoppers overseas, from where Jack Ma wants to get more than half the company’s revenue within a decade. A cooling Chinese economy makes that effort even more pressing. At home, JD.com Inc. is winning customers partly because it holds the inventory itself and sells directly to consumers, similar to Amazon, a business model easier to police and regulate, said Michelle Ma, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “By now, management should have eliminated this problem,” said Cyrus Mewawalla, managing director of London-based CM Research. “The fact that they haven’t is a worrying sign forinvestors.”Theranos Founder Faces a Test of Technology, and Reputation: Last year, as the deadly and highly contagious Ebola virus threatened to spread around the globe, Theranos, a Silicon Valley start-up, was scrambling to find a test that could quickly detect if a person was infected. This was exactly the sort of thing the company was supposed to do. Its fundamental promise was to revolutionize laboratory testing by offering hundreds of different blood tests that could be done through a simple finger stick for a fraction of the cost of typical lab blood work. More than that, Elizabeth Holmes, who started the company in 2003, had a higher-minded purpose. She also wanted to defeat epidemics. The company devoted significant resources to the Ebola effort. “We stopped everything for Ebola — for the world,” says Richard Kovacevich, the former chief executive of Wells Fargo, who joined Theranos as a director in 2013. And then, nothing. Even as other companies received approval from regulators, Theranos watched from the sidelines. “I have no doubt we would have” gotten the green light for the tests, Mr. Kovacevich said. But the crisis ebbed, and the company says getting approval for that test is no longer a priority. Now, after a surprise inspection last summer, the Food and Drug Administration is requiring that Theranos’s equipment and individual tests go through the regulatory process and get approval. This will determine whether its foundational technology is a reality — or, like that Ebola test, an unfulfilled grand promise. While Theranos says it has conducted millions of tests, largely through a partnership with Walgreens, the drugstore chain, no one from outside Theranos has ever verified the technology. Institutions whose names were often linked with Theranos, like the Cleveland Clinic, insist they have not yet had a chance to use the technology. It has struggled to forge business relationships with other potential partners, like Safeway.Waze Could Be Google’s Ace in the Hole in a Self-Driving Car War With Uber: It’s 2025. You’re in a big city and have somewhere to be. Fire up an app and an autonomous car — with a driver at the wheel or maybe without one — picks you up. Odds are good the company behind that car will be Uber or Google. The two are set to vie for the reigning position as the transit service platform of the future. Uber has advantages — for one, its name is becoming the verb for ride-hailing, the way Google’s has for search. But Google has the mobile platform, the lead in self-driving tech and deeper pockets. It has another edge: Deep ties with local governments, critical players in making autonomous vehicles a reality. This proximity is thanks to Waze, the mapping startup Google bought in 2013, which has invested heavily in building data-sharing agreements with cities around the world. If autonomous cars are going to work, there needs to be tight coordination of transit data between governments and private companies. Before you can hail a self-driving car, there’ll likely need to be a host of things (designated lanes, re-zonings, ordinances) that let it drive itself. Then there is the planning to ensure they drive effectively. That’s why Google has cut data deals with its flagship mapping product, and why Uber is scrambling to build similar programs. Waze is, from what we can tell, ahead. In its program, called the Connected Citizens Program, Waze hands over info reported by its users, like accidents and road closures, to urban governments free of charge. It has cut deals with 51 cities worldwide; they get fresh data from the app’s users every two minutes. For cities, the program gives them timely, unprecedented data that helps manage traffic flows, safety and (ideally) costs. In Boston, a city not known for its sober traffic design, officials are using Waze data to measure the impact of their planning changes. “We heard that traffic improved anecdotally,” said Connor McKay, a data scientist for the city. “Now we can say that, quantitatively, traffic has improved.” In return, cities give Waze their own traffic data. (This is why you may see some Uber drivers using Waze to get around.) Accurate road information is critical to making self-driving cars work — hence, Uber hurriedly pouring its investor stockpile into a mapping operation. The ballooning ride-hailing startup has had less success currying favor with city officials. It has proved it can get its way in cities, but usually after some messy standoffs. This summer, Waze rolled out its first flirtation with Uber’s turf: A trial in Tel Aviv that lets Waze users pick up passengers along their commute routes. It has since expanded to a few suburbs around the city. A Waze rep would only share that the Google unit is “quite pleased with the results.” Waze also insists that its trial is not like Uber — drivers aren’t making money, and the program is framed as a way for cities to tackle congestion problems. It’s a key framing. When governments begin to approach autonomy, they are likely to turn to tech partners they know best.How Intelligent Lighting Is Ushering In The Internet Of Buildings:  The LED revolution is over. To no one’s surprise, LEDs have won. Solid-state lighting is changing how we light the world, successfully displacing traditional illumination sources across every part of the global lighting market. Over the next few years, billions of sockets will be in play. This transition has kicked off a new phase of LED adoption — the race to connect every socket. The stakes are high for consumers and vendors alike. A trifecta of qualities — ubiquity, network connectivity and access to power — make intelligent lights a perfect platform on which the promise of the Internet of Things can start to come to life. Behind the scenes, this race to own sockets is really a contest to see who will control the infrastructure of the IoT across our built environment. These intelligent, networked, sensor-laden lights of the near future will form the central nervous system of every smart building. Beyond simple illumination, this “Internet of Buildings” built on top of next-generation lighting systems will forever change the way we interact with the spaces in which we live. In your kids’ elementary school, biometric sensors will track students’ alertness, subtly shifting spectrum to automatically boost their focus any time it starts to wane. Around the corner at the grocery store, beacons embedded in connected fixtures will track every movement you (or your mobile phone) make — from produce to dairy — beaming coupons at you along the way. Even the lights around your home will be intelligent, learning from and responding to the steady stream of data generated by your wearable devices — using light to help de-stress you after a long day or to perk you up on a cold, dark winter morning. Consumer-facing tech giants — Apple, Google, Amazon — see residential lighting as a key step toward the connected home. Why settle for one or two thermostats or smart toasters when you can gather data from dozens of sensor-enabled lights scattered throughout every house and apartment? For networking companies — Cisco, Qualcomm and their ilk — intelligent lighting is an infrastructure play. Billions of connected lights will need new routing fabric, if only to handle the massive amount of new data traffic they will produce. Even the largest building management systems companies — Siemens, Honeywell, Schneider, Johnson Controls — see the threat posed to their core businesses in HVAC and physical security as the next generation of intelligent buildings are built on top of new lighting networks. Of course, the traditional lighting players — Acuity, Philips, GE — are deeply engaged in this shift, too. But their success is far from guaranteed. The land grab is on. Who will win?Big IPO, Tiny Payout for Many Startup Workers: Side deals and volatile shares make stock options a bigger gamble for startup employees.The frustrated expectations of early employees have become a common thread in the latest round of technology IPOs. It used to be “the get-rich story happened for people who joined in the early days,” says Saar Gur, general partner at Charles River Ventures. Now they can be among the few left behind. Many executives, early investors, and even later investors are able to cash out before the rank and file, or bargain for guarantees that help ensure a bonanza. Whatever happens with an IPO, executives tend to hang on to enough equity to guarantee huge payouts when they sell their shares. Most early investors get a chance to sell options on secondary markets before a company’s IPO. Later investors increasingly demand preferential treatment, including agreements that if an IPO underperforms the terms of their investment, they’ll be made whole with an equivalent amount of additional shares. Late-stage investors in both Box and Square had such so-called ratchet agreements in place, further devaluing locked-up employee equity. When those kinds of deals are in place, employees often find their payouts disappointing because they’re so diluted, says Clara Sieg, a partner at Revolution Ventures. Box and Square declined to comment for this story. Ordinary employees are typically without meaningful financial protections or even a clear sense of what their equity stakes mean, says Chris Zaharis, who’s worked at startups for about 20 years and as a volunteer teaches people about their equity rights. Options grants often don’t come with information on strike prices (discounts on shares), preferential treatment, or even the total number of shares outstanding. “People on average overestimate what they are going to make by about 10X,” he says.Driverless Cars Have A Crash Rate Twice As High As Regular Cars - Because They Always Follow The Rules. They  The self-driving car, that cutting-edge creation that’s supposed to lead to a world without accidents, is achieving the exact opposite right now: The vehicles have racked up a crash rate double that of those with human drivers. The glitch? They obey the law all the time, as in, without exception. This may sound like the right way to program a robot to drive a car, but good luck trying to merge onto a chaotic, jam-packed highway with traffic flying along well above the speed limit. It tends not to work out well. As the accidents have piled up -- all minor scrape-ups for now -- the arguments among programmers at places like Google  and Carnegie Mellon University are heating up: Should they teach the cars how to commit infractions from time to time to stay out of trouble? “It’s a constant debate inside our group,” said Raj Rajkumar, co-director of the General Motors-Carnegie Mellon Autonomous Driving Collaborative Research Lab in Pittsburgh. Turns out, though, their accident rates are twice as high as for regular cars, according to a study by the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Driverless vehicles have never been at fault, the study found: They’re usually hit from behind in slow-speed crashes by inattentive or aggressive humans unaccustomed to machine motorists that always follow the rules and proceed with caution. Last year, Rajkumar offered test drives to members of Congress in his lab’s self-driving Cadillac SRX sport utility vehicle. The Caddy performed perfectly, except when it had to merge onto I-395 South and swing across three lanes of traffic in 150 yards (137 meters) to head toward the Pentagon. The car’s cameras and laser sensors detected traffic in a 360-degree view but didn’t know how to trust that drivers would make room in the ceaseless flow, so the human minder had to take control to complete the maneuver.Apple names Jeff Williams COO, a job once held by Tim Cook: Apple Inc promoted longtime executive Jeff Williams to the role of chief operating officer, reinstating the title previously held by Chief Executive Tim Cook, as part of a series of changes to the company's leadership team. Williams, who joined Apple in 1998, previously served as senior vice president of operations and oversaw development of the Apple Watch, the company's first new product since the iPad. \"Jeff is hands-down the best operations executive I've ever worked with,\" Cook said in a statement. While it was unclear if the appointment meant Apple was grooming Williams to be Cook's successor, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a source, that the move did not necessarily signal that.Yelp, OpenTable part ways amid heightened competition: Review site Yelp Inc and restaurant reservation service OpenTable have quietly ended a long-running partnership, the companies confirmed on Thursday, as the one-time allies increasingly eye each other's businesses. The companies parted ways in April under mounting competition, with OpenTable facing new rivals to its reservation business and Yelp dogged with questions about stalling growth. Both companies are trying to take charge of the entire customer experience, said an analyst. \"If they have to share that customer with someone else, it threatens their long-term viability,\" he said. The companies halted a deal that since 2010 had allowed users to make OpenTable reservations through Yelp, home to a trove of reviews from diners.Fed Raises Key Interest Rate for First Time in Almost a Decade: The Federal Reserve announced on Wednesday that it would raise its benchmark interest rate, a vote of confidence in the American economy. Policy makers have waited a long time for this moment: Since December 2008 the Fed has held the benchmark rate near zero, the centerpiece of its campaign to revive economic growth and reduce unemployment from the recession. Fed officials predicted that they would raise interest rates by about one percentage point a year over the next three years — an indication that they would be taking a slow-and-steady approach to economic expansion. The cost of borrowing is expected to rise, but only slightly, with variable effects on what banks charge for credit cards, home equity lines of credit, adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and some student loans. Remember, Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, has said the Fed will move cautiously in raising its benchmark rate. Financial markets were encouraged by the Fed’s announcement. Stocks rose, the dollar gained modestly and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose slightly. The Fed’s announcement came exactly seven years to the day after the central bank cut its benchmark rate nearly to zero.Amazon Leads $23M Investment In India-Based Home Services Startup Housejoy: Amazon has led a $23 million investment in India-based Housejoy, a startup that — as the name not-so-subtly suggests — is much like Homejoy, the home services on-demand company that closed its doors this summer. The U.S. e-commerce giant was joined in the Series A round by existing investor Matrix Partners, and new backers Vertex Ventures, Qualcomm and Ru-Net Technology Partners. Unlike U.S.-based Homejoy — which had raised nearly $40 million and was the most visible player in an emerging category — Housejoy offers more than just home cleaning services. It caters to plumbing, electrical/appliance repairs, beauty, fitness, laundry and pest control and more. The startup is less than a year old, it previously raised $4 million, and is currently available in 11 cities across India. With this new funding, CEO Saran Chatterjee told TechCrunch that it plans to expand to cover 25 cities by the end of next year. The involvement of Amazon, which previously invested in India-based deals with financial comparison service BankBazaar and gift card startup QwikCilver, is interesting. Its founder Jeff Bezos hasn’t been shy in admitting that the company is very much focused on growing in India, where it launched two years ago and is rivaled by two home-grown unicorns: SoftBank-backed Flipkart and Alibaba-backed Snapdeal. Last year, Amazon invested $2 billion in its India business and results seem to be going its way after it recently claimed to have beaten its well-backed rivals on monthly traffic for the first time. Chatterjee stressed in an interview that Amazon hasn’t discussed acquiring Housejoy, and that its involvement in the round could unlock a lucrative partnership for the startup. Beyond its expansion, Housejoy plans to use the money to ramp its quality assurance protocols which evaluate and assess the ‘service providers’ who work for the company. In that way, it’s very much like Uber — a marketplace through which independent workers can find jobs. With some customers experiencing issues with the service — including one India-based writer at Tech In Asia — Chatterjee admits that it needs to raise its reliability from (probably) a seven out of ten score, to nine or ten. The company is also planning to spend a portion of its funding on strategic acquisitions. Chatterjee said that around 10 percent of the round — so roughly $2 million — could go towards buying up companies or acquihiring teams that “give us a position of strength in a city or category, or [add to the] team and talent.”In a Self-Serve World, Start-Ups Find Value in Human Helpers: The Internet took off as a way to book travel because the human intermediaries were always a bit suspect — their expertise questionable, their methods opaque and their allegiances unclear. And at first, the machines seemed to improve everything. For uncomplicated trips, booking online is now much easier than in the past. Because we’ve replaced agents with computers whose sole purpose is to ferret out the best deal, and for lots of other reasons, airfares have plummeted over the last three decades. Yet as you suffer through another holiday travel season, you might pause to consider how much we’ve really gained — and lost — in ditching human agents for machines. And you might welcome an emerging trend on the Internet: start-ups that are trying to put human agents, whether in travel, home services or shopping, back at the center of how we make decisions. “A lot of companies pushed hard on the idea that technology will solve every problem, and that we shouldn’t use humans,” said Paul English, the co-founder of a new online company called Lola Travel. “We think humans add value, so we’re trying to design technology to facilitate the human-to-human connection.” Lola, which is currently open only in a limited prerelease version, has an unusual interface: When you’re looking to book a trip, you just send a text. Your request can be vague — “Hey, my family is thinking about going to Europe next summer” — because on the other end sits a human. The agent knows your general travel preferences and has access to many of the same tools you’d use to book a trip. But the agent also has something extra — experience and data to help make decisions about the kind of trip you should take.The Future of Wearables Is Normal Clothes Made Smart: The current crop of wearables has mostly been constrained to your wrist in the form of clunky Apple Watches and Moto 360s. Attempt to vary the where in wearables, like Google Glass — the no-longer-in-production spectacles so nerdy only cast members from The Big Bang Theory dared to wear them out in public — have already been cast to the junk heap of history. When a gadget seemingly straight from the future couldn’t cut it, it speaks to the fact that we need our wearables to be stylish and practical. In the future wearables will most likely be simply known as just clothes. Companies like Intel are already working to make what seems like a far-off vision a reality. \"The most exciting thing is going to be when the technology [becomes] so small and tiny that we'll be able to embed it into anything and everything,\" Aysegul Ildeniz, the vice president of Intel’s New Devices, tells us. \"So we’re talking about potentially, one day, fabrics or the stuff we wear on us will be smart... we could put it in a hat, or shoe, or pants.\"Hudson’s Bay Is Said to Consider Buying Gilt Groupe for $250 Million: Gilt Groupe, a onetime darling of online fashion sales, is nearing a deal to sell itself — albeit at a steep discount to its once lofty valuation. The Hudson’s Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, is in advanced talks to buy the start-up for about $250 million, a person briefed on the matter said on Monday. That is down significantly from the $1 billion valuation that Gilt fetched more than three years ago. A deal could be announced early next year, though people briefed on the talks cautioned that negotiations were still underway and could still fall apart. Gilt is also speaking with a handful of other potential buyers in addition to Hudson’s Bay, according to another person briefed on the talks. Should the two sides reach an agreement, it would cap a long and volatile ride for Gilt, which shook up the fashion industry when it opened for business eight years ago. The company focused on so-called flash sales, in which consumers have a limited amount of time to buy clothes, accessories and furniture sold by the site. The business model was so popular that Gilt raised $138 million from investors like SoftBank of Japan and Goldman Sachs in 2011, even as it remained unprofitable. And the online retailer was regarded as a star in New York City’s start-up community. The company’s early success bolstered the reputations of its founders, including Alexis Maybank, Alexandra Wilkis Wilson and Kevin P. Ryan, the former chief executive of the online ad company DoubleClick, who also served as chief executive of Gilt. But flash sale sites, like Gilt, have lost their luster as consumers become increasingly desensitized to deals, analysts say.In Virtual Reality Headsets, Investors Glimpse the Future: Magic Leap, a secretive company making wearable technology for mixing digital imagery with the real world, is seeking to raise $827 million. Jaunt, maker of a 3-D camera for filming virtual reality video, has nabbed a total of $100 million, including $65 million in September. And 8i, which makes technology that lets people interact with video of humans as though they were in the same room, has raised nearly $15 million. None of these start-ups is a household name. Few members of the public have had an opportunity to interact with — much less buy — the virtual and augmented reality technology that these companies are developing.Yet investors and entrepreneurs believe that headsets made to immerse people in digital worlds are the next giant moneymakers in technology, setting off an investor frenzy rarely seen since the early days of the web and mobile markets. Virtual reality start-ups are multiplying, venture capital is pouring into them and the believers are expressing blue-sky thinking about how the new products could reshape entertainment, communications and work.Diagnosing Yahoo’s Ills: Ugly Math in Marissa Mayer’s Reign: Let’s do some basic math about Yahoosince Marissa Mayer took the helm over three years ago. She paid about $3 billion for acquisitions of companies you’ve mostly never heard of, like Aviate, Polyvore and Distill (and one company you may have heard of, Tumblr). She spent $9.4 billion on stock buybacks; over the last two years, when the stock was trading higher, the buybacks have been a $2.5 billion money-losing trade. About $365 million of compensation went to Ms. Mayer herself, assuming she stays for an additional year and a half. And $109 million to an executive she hired to be her chief operating officer, who was then summarily fired 15 months later. An estimated $450 million on free food for the staff. And, depending on whom you believe, double-digit millions of dollars on parties and events, including a “Great Gatsby”-themed holiday party several weeks ago that was held with no apparent irony. Many of those figures come from a devastating new presentation sent to Yahoo’s board over the weekend by Eric Jackson, who runs a small hedge fund called SpringOwl Asset Management and who has long railed about the company’s missteps.E-Commerce  Retailers in India Battle Devil They Spawned: Deep Discounts: Discounts and cashback offers helped India’s top e-commerce companies from Flipkart to Snapdeal sell a record $11 billion of goods this year online. As the freebies start to hurt, they are questioning a strategy they now find too hard to dump. While scrapping rebates may bring the focus back to profitability from valuations, it may be easier said than done for an industry built on a foundation of cut-price sales. The real dilemma faced by Narayanan and his peers is: Who will blink first? China's Baidu says to develop self-driving buses within three years: China's top online search firm Baidu Inc said it aims to put self-driving buses on the road in three years and mass produce them within five years, after it set up a business unit to oversee all its efforts related to automobiles. The unit will also include its initiative in partnership with BMW AG to develop an autonomous passenger vehicle, which may also be put into mass production within five years, a spokesman told Reuters on Monday. Self-driving cars have emerged as a new battlefront for tech majors globally. Alibaba Group Holding says it will launch its first car in a partnership with China's SAIC Motor Corp, while U.S. tech heavyweights Google and Apple are also developing autonomous cars.Creator of Mathematica, Stephen Wolfram Launches Free Version of Wolfram Language: For nearly three decades, Stephen Wolfram has built software technology that has attracted an avid following among mathematicians and scientists. His Mathematica program for symbolic mathematical computation and its programming language, Wolfram Language, are favorites of the intelligentsia of the quant world in universities and corporations. Wolfram Alpha, his question-answer technology, is available on its own website and serves up many of the answers for Apple’s voice-controlled digital assistant, Siri. His approach to this artificial-intelligence challenge was both innovative and idiosyncratic, and characteristic of Mr. Wolfram, who earned his Ph.D. in particle physics from the California Institute of Technology when he was 20 and soon after received a MacArthur “genius” award. Wolfram Alpha, he explains, is a “knowledge-based system,” which computes answers from its storehouse of knowledge rather than today’s prevailing technique of determining statistical probabilities from poring through vast amounts of data. His Wolfram Language is similarly a tool for what he calls “knowledge-based programming.” And Mr. Wolfram wants to make his technology and his software philosophy available to far more people, including newcomers to computing, like students and children. So he has decided to make a version of the Wolfram Language and development tools available as a free cloud service. To help, he also has published a book, “An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language,” which is free to read online. Wolfram Language is already one of the programming languages distributed with the Raspberry Pi, a credit card-size computer that can be plugged into a computer monitor or television and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. The most popular model is $35. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a British charity founded in 2009 to further basic education in computing to young people of all income levels. Its nonprofit company, Raspberry Pi Trading, sells the inexpensive, general-purpose computers.Why Glass Is Critical to the Future of Tech: One material has emerged that is probably second only to the processor when it comes to the importance of delivering a great user experience in all types of devices, especially mobile ones. That material is the glass screens on billions of feature and smartphones in the market today. Putting glass screens on a table top and turning it into a huge interactive screen could change the way many people interact with their digital content. Making glass walls that can show off all types of video and content, and applications that can be touched to activate them, is exciting. Imagine a glass screen on your refrigerator, or a glass mirror in the bathroom that delivers a touch-based gateway to all of your digital “stuff,” and you begin to see the role glass will play in a much broader way in the near future.Is Acqui-Hiring Dead? Tech Startups Long for the Days of Yahoo’s Binge Acquisitions: Under Marissa Mayer, Yahoo used to be the top company making “acqui-hires,” but such talent acquisitions have fallen out of favor throughout Silicon Valley this year. In 2013 and 2014, Yahoo was the top technology company conducting acqui-hires, an industry term for acquisitions done primarily for the talent, according to research firm CB Insights. Yahoo was tied for third in 2012, Mayer's first year at the company. In 2015, Yahoo has disappeared from the list entirely. When Mayer joined from Google, she was looking for an infusion of technical and entrepreneurial talent to improve the company's mobile and Web services. The fresh blood failed to revive the staid Internet portal, and now Yahoo is considering a spinoff of its core Web business to address investors' tax concerns. \"They made acquisitions, and nothing came out of it,\" said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Co. \"The focus has shifted over the last few quarters to integrate, rather than acquire.\" Sarah Meron, a spokeswoman for Yahoo, declined to comment. The excitement surrounding talent acquisitions has dissipated throughout Silicon Valley, not just at Yahoo. Active acquirers, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, have started to pull back on buying for talent, CB Insights said. U.S. talent acquisitions have declined 48 percent this year from a peak in 2013, the firm's data show. CB Insights compiled the information from company reports, which wouldn't include undisclosed purchases or those not classified as talent acquisitions. Instead of pursuing costly acqui-hires, many companies have returned to old-fashioned recruitment, said Ben Narasin, a general partner at Canvas Ventures. \"All of these top firms need more people, but are you really willing to pay a million-dollar cost of acquisition for a whole bunch of people?\" he said. \"I think acqui-hiring is dead.\"2015 Was The Worst Year For Tech IPOs Since 2009: With just 28 technology companies entering the U.S. public markets, 2015 was the worst year for IPOs since 2009, according to Dealogic. This compares to 62 last year and 48 the year before, with 131 “unicorns” opting to remain private longer. The performance of the tech IPOs has also been subpar. Half of the tech companies that have gone public this year are trading below their IPO price, including Etsy which fell 41%. And both Box and Square, went public at market caps that were beneath the valuation of their last private rounds. Companies which had strong fundamentals, like Atlassian, were able to hit the ground running. Fitbit is up 56% since its June IPO and GoDaddy, which is on the verge of profitability, has risen 68%. “2016 may see 2 types of companies go public,” said Anand Sanwal, CEO of CB Insights. “One are the good companies with solid fundamentals. The other set of companies are those that get pushed into going public because the private markets close up on them.”Adidas’s ‘speedfactory’ hints at the future of shoe manufacturing:  Adidas announced this week that it is setting up what it calls a “speedfactory” in Ansbach, Germany, in an attempt to be at the forefront of manufacturing and offer individualized products that get in customers’ hands quicker. Its goal is to use the latest manufacturing innovations to produce a largely automated process. (From a business perspective, it’s not appealing to shift factories to areas with higher labor costs, unless the operation runs with minimal human labor.) By leveraging recent developments in robotics, Adidas may be able to better serve its customers. In the long run, the model could potentially expand beyond shoes to all goods. For example, after a big sporting event the conversation among sport fans in a given city might center around an athlete’s latest touchdown celebration dance, or a clever quip to reporters. If a company such as Adidas had a factory located near that city, it could rapidly produce and sell related merchandise before the conversation had cooled off.  The first step for Adidas is to produce 500 pairs of concept shoes in the first half of 2016. Those initial pairs will all be one type of running shoes. Down the line Adidas envisions custom-made shoes that might have a sole designed to fit an individual customer’s foot.Alibaba Buys Prominent And Vocal Hong Kong Newspaper For $266M In Bid To Influence Media: The Alibaba Group, the Chinese Internet giant, is making an ambitious play to reshape media coverage of its home country, taking aim at what company executives call the “negative” portrayal of China in the Western media. As the backbone of this effort, Alibaba agreed on Friday to buy the media assets of the SCMP Group, including one of Hong Kong’s most influential English language daily newspapers, The South China Morning Post. Alibaba is acquiring an award-winning newspaper that for decades has reported aggressively on subjects that China’s state-run media outlets are forbidden to cover, like political scandals and human-rights cases.Alibaba said the deal was fueled by a desire to improve China’s image and offer an alternative to what it calls the biased lens of Western news outlets. While Alibaba said the Chinese government had no role in its deal to buy the Hong Kong newspaper, the company’s position aligns closely with that of the Communist Party, which has grown increasingly critical of the way Western news organizations cover China. This coverage, the company said, influences how investors and others outside China regard Alibaba. The company said its shares, which are listed in New York, were being affected by all the negative reports about China. For Alibaba, the financial stakes are not significant. Estimated to be worth $266 million, the deal represents a relatively small amount for a company with more than $12 billion in annual revenue. The bigger risk is reputational, as Alibaba leaps into the realm of politics. In owning The South China Morning Post, Alibaba will control a news organization that operates along a border that separates two systems, one in Hong Kong with a relatively free press and another in mainland China with strict censorship controls. As speculation of a deal began in recent weeks, some critics in Hong Kong had already started to worry about whether Alibaba was seeking to tame the paper’s coverage in order to curry favor with the Chinese leadership. The newspaper, which is not subject to China’s strict censorship rules, has long jumped into controversial issues on the mainland like covering the anniversary of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square and last year’s Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong. The newspaper has delved into scandals among China’s elite, including Ling Jihua, who served as an aide to the former Chinese president Hu Jintao.Wal-Mart adds to mobile wallet frenzy with 'Walmart Pay': Wal-Mart launched its own mobile payment service Walmart Pay on Thursday, potentially dealing a sharp blow to the ambitions of a mobile wallet the company had been co-developing with a consortium of retailers. The mobile payments space in the U.S. has seen a flurry of new launches and partnerships in the past year but has failed to gain traction as customer and merchant adoption have been sluggish. CurrentC - whose developers included Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy among others - was likely to prove strong competition to Apple's Apple Pay because it was developed as a single payment solution that could be used at many retailers and integrate their loyalty programs. But years of delay, a data breach and management changes hurt its prospects. An increasingly bigger worry for CurrentC is the end of its exclusive partnership with most of its members, which means they can now accept other mobile payment options at their stores. A survey released by data firm InfoScout found Apple Pay use to be at its lowest rate since the firm started tracking it. Shoppers used it this past Black Friday for only 2.7 percent of eligible transactions.Rovio’s CEO Steps Down After Just Over a Year: Last August Pekka Rantala took over the role of Rovio CEO from co-founder Mikael Hed, but just over a year later he’s already stepping down. He’s to be replaced by Kati Levoranta, former chief legal officer for the Angry Birds maker. Rantala says that “I feel now the time is right for me to step aside and move on to new challenges.” Despite being in the role for a relatively short period, Rantala presided over a tumultuous time for the game developer. Last October the company laid off 130 employees, and followed that up with 260 more job cuts in August, more than 30 percent of its workforce. The initial, unexpected success of Angry Birds caused the company to expand in many directions, yet it never managed to follow up Angry Birds with another big hit.Big data company Palantir raises $679.8 million: Palantir Technologies, the data firm best known for helping the U.S. government track down al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, has raised $679.8 million, according to a filing on Wednesday. The cash injection, which further expands the $500 million the company originally said it was raising in July, shows that despite shifting market conditions for privately held companies investors still hold confidence in the strongest of them, particularly those geared toward enterprises. Palantir is currently valued at $20 billion, making it the richest venture-backed company in the United States after ride service Uber and accommodation service Airbnb. It works closely with the U.S. government, whose steady business provides part of the reason investors like the Palo Alto, California-based company.Atlassian, the Profitable Aussie Unicorn Going Public Tomorrow: Atlassian is Australian management and workplace software maker. It’s set to begin trading on the Nasdaq tomorrow under the ticker symbol TEAM. Atlassian is looking to raise $440 million at a $4.2 billion valuation, up from the $370 million at under $4 billion it was shopping around last week. The bootstrapped Sydney, Australia-based startup has never taken any VC funding, and says it has been profitable for the last 10 years. The service it offers that people are most likely to have heard of is HipChat, an office chat and workflow management service that’s squaring off against Silicon Valley-adored Slack. CNBC has a detailed rundown on what Atlassian’s IPO prospectus says about its business. Atlassian is an outlier to all this. A decade of profitability buys a lot of credibility with investors, and having never taken venture dollars, it doesn’t have to worry about activating a ratchet if something goes wrong tomorrow.Who won, who lost in Square's IPO? Square’s recent $2.9 billion IPO is either a huge win for its investors or a sign of very bad days to come, depending on whether you believe the “high-five” tweets from prominent venture capitalists (VCs) or the slew of hand-wringing articles — from sources like NPR, The Verge and the Wall Street Journal — essentially saying it marks the end of free-flowing startup capital.The wildly contradictory responses to Square’s Nov. 19 debut on the New York Stock Exchange, when the payments-processing company’s stock was priced below its previous funding round in the private markets, has left a lot of people in the startup community (and beyond) wondering what’s going on. My take is that the IPO is further evidence that the new rules of the hunt for “unicorns” — startups valued at more than one billion dollars — are creating a small class of “haves” and a much larger class of “have-nots.” The lucky ones are the earliest-stage investors that find tomorrow’s unicorns. The less lucky are often the late-stage investors — generally the providers of the bulk of the capital — and the talent that signs on as these companies grow to fighting strength and scale. I think this is likely to cause a rebalancing of late-stage valuations and an increase in transparency in private markets. AT&T is out-building Google Fiber: Consider this: The number of cities where Google Fiber has actually been switched on can be counted on your fingers, whereas AT&T GigaPower is already up and running in some 20 metropolitan areas. Where many of Google's prospective expansions are still in the discussion phase, AT&T has made concrete — though critics might say \"limited\" — investments in many more markets. In short, AT&T is out-building Google Fiber. That's a sign of a broader shift in the industry. What we're seeing now is Google's early lead in the fiber race being eaten away by AT&T's traditional advantage in building networks. Though Google deserves much of the credit for jump-starting the competition in the first place, not to mention blazing a trail for AT&T in important ways, AT&T is on pace to beat Google to many cities in America. And this is why. AT&T is benefiting tremendously from a chain reaction that Google initially began. By now, it's a familiar story: Google went around to cities and basically got them to compete for Google Fiber, handing out a standardized checklist to municipalities laying out all the things they could do to make themselves more attractive to the search giant. In so doing, Google drew attention to many local regulatory processes that otherwise slow down investments in infrastructure. Now, mayors everywhere are scrambling over each other to attract Google. And that has had knock-on benefits for AT&T. In plain English, when Google gets a good deal, so can AT&T. But getting the rights to dig up streets or string fiber along telephone poles is only part of the equation. Then there's the matter of actually doing it. And it can take a long time — in Google's case, as many as 18 months in Kansas City, according to Hunter Newby, chief executive of the company Allied Fiber. And in Austin, Texas, AT&T says it beat Google to market by roughly two years, even though the two companies announced their projects within days of each other. Google declined to comment. Part of what's going on is that AT&T is leaning on decades of expertise in building networks. Many analysts say that Google aims to invest just enough into fiber to encourage more traditional providers to build out their own networks. Then, when consumers subscribe to the better service and take heavier advantage of Google services, Google's core business benefits. In that respect, Google isn't so much going toe-to-toe with AT&T as nudging it to expand.Investors hover as e-tailers boost demand for Indian warehouses: E-commerce in India is booming: the market is expected to grow to $220 billion in terms of value of goods sold by 2025, up from an expected $11 billion this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. With more Indian consumers shopping online, the country's $110 billion logistics and warehousing sector is stretched. e-tailers need to move goods around swiftly with minimal damage. They demand fire sprinkler systems, climate control, levelled loading bays and paved roads to warehouses. Simply adding this in can lift rents by up to 20 percent, according to real estate firm JLL. Existing spaces, known as \"godowns\" - low-rise sheds with poor ventilation and only a shutter to ward off heat and dust - are too old and cramped for firms like retail giant Amazon.com and Indian rival Flipkart. Amazon India has leased 20 fulfilment centres - warehouses where it stores goods and packs and sorts orders - in the last 18 months from multiple landlords. Still, it needs bigger, modern spaces closer to customers; the average size it leases today is 200,000 square feet. To satisfy that, supply of modern warehouses in India is set to more than double by 2020 to 200 million square feet, JLL estimates, fuelled by online retailers. They took up over 20 percent of the space added in the first half of 2015. Overseas firms including Dutch pension fund manager APG and U.S. buyout group Warburg Pincus are looking to invest in India's warehouses, hoping to cash in on demand for modern and efficient storage space from booming online retailers. \"We have got enough people running around with bags of money, and not that many assets,\" said Ben Salmon, head of Singapore-based Assetz Property Group that has raised $50 million from Asian investors to buy warehouses in India.It’s Come to This: Yahoo’s Future Now Hinges on Taxes (And Not Products):  Yahoo is not going to spin off its 15% stake in e-commerce giant Alibaba, according to sources cited by CNBC. Instead, Yahoo is going to look into selling its core Internet business. Yahoo’s core business includes its web properties, apps, search, media, ad business, etc. Yahoo’s 15% stake in Alibaba is worth around $32 billion, while its core Internet business is worth anywhere between $3.4 billion and $4.1 billion, according to analysts. Internet companies are about a lot of things, but primarily their success hinges on making great and innovative products. And unless the execution of getting those offerings out is just abysmal, this trumps all in Silicon Valley. That was the alleged promise of bringing in Google wunderkind Marissa Mayer as Yahoo CEO more than four years ago. Now the company’s fate seems in the hands of tax attorneys, rather than entrepreneurs, which tells you all you need to know about Yahoo at the end of 2015. Last week, Re/code and others reported that the board of the Internet giant was seriously considering pausing the spinoff of its enormously valuable stake in China’s Alibaba Group. The reason: While Mayer and Yahoo CFO Ken Goldman were assured by their pricey tax advisers at Skadden Arps that the transaction would be tax-free, the Internal Revenue Service would not provide any guarantee of that. No spinoff puts Yahoo into play in a very significant way, even if the board does not say so. And none of it has anything to do with creating great products for consumers, which was the only thing that would have saved Yahoo in the first place. Score one for the accountants.Google’s High-End Pixel C Tablet Launches to Tepid Reviews: In September, Google surprised us all when it announced its Surface competitor, the 10.2-inch Pixel C Android tablet with its optional Bluetooth keyboard. Unlike its Nexus line of tablets, this is the first time Google has built its own tablet. If you’re willing to pay the price — starting at $499 for the 32GB model plus another $149 for the keyboard — the Pixel C is a very nice, solid tablet that sits atop the current crop of Android tablets. At that price, it directly competes with the iPad Air 2 (though the basic model of the Air only comes with 32GB of storage space). The Pixel C is now available in the Google Play store in a select number of countries. You can now buy it in the U.S., Canada, Germany, Ireland, Austria, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, France, Spain, Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland. If you think this tablet/keyboard combo sounds a little bit like a Microsoft Surface, or maybe even Apple’s iPad Pro with a keyboard, you’re not alone. It’s impossible not to compare the C with them. While Microsoft’s Surface is essentially a fully featured laptop with a detachable keyboard, Google and Apple are opting for a combination of a tablet and mobile operating system with a keyboard. There is a market for the C, but I think it’ll be a small one. The Pixel Chromebooks were meant to show what you can build when you don’t cut corners to keep the price down — the C is meant to showcase what that would look like for a high-end Android productivity tablet. It’s the Android Tablet for the CEO — assuming your CEO uses Android.In China's O2O tech, today's 'unicorns' risk becoming tomorrow's 'unicorpses': The Beijing offices of Shequ001, a start-up delivering supermarket goods booked via smartphone, stand almost deserted. Leaflets lie scattered on the floor. Nearly 400 former employees, of a workforce that in March topped 2,000, have joined a social network clamoring to get their unpaid wages. Zhang, who gave only his family name, is one of fewer than three dozen workers left at a company that last year was worth 2 billion yuan ($312 million). \"We just wanted to build the market, so we burned through our money,\" he said, adding he hasn't seen the firm's CEO since March. In China's hottest tech sector, hundreds of \"online to offline\" (O2O) start-ups like Shequ001, which draw mobile users to local physical stores and services, have failed as skyrocketing valuations deter investors and put the brakes on fresh funding. Many more are expected to fall by the wayside, or be driven into mergers in what executives and investors say is a market bubble. China now boasts 21 'unicorns' - private start-ups valued at over $1 billion - says CB Insights. But now, those inflated valuations - for companies that rarely make any money - are proving too much for investors and new funding is drying up. O2O has found particular traction in China through a combination of widespread smartphone use, a booming mobile payment sector and cheap migrant labor. Entrepreneurs developing O2O apps - for firms offering anything from ride hailing and food delivery to group discounts at shops, restaurants and cinemas - have had easy access to money from technology giants Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as well as from venture capitalists, private equity, sovereign wealth funds and state-owned enterprises. Start-ups backed by venture capital raised $9.6 billion in July-September alone, four times the level of a year earlier, according to a KPMG and CB Insights report. \"The whole O2O concept is getting too expensive,\" said Han Weiwen, head of Bain's private equity practice in China. \"The valuation is very, very high. There's no traditional way to look at the valuation ... because they don't have revenue.\" The fierce competition and high spending drives start-ups back to their investors for frequent cash injections, pushing valuations higher. But as the financing roller-coaster has slowed, many start-ups have struggled to afford the subsidized discounts they need to keep users. In O2O, user numbers, whether from inflated demand or not, are a key metric to attracting fresh investment. \"This kind of craziness can't go on forever,\" said Liu Jun, who heads Baidu's efforts in O2O and sits on the board of Uber's China unit. \"Enough is enough.\"Apple Executive Seeks a Touch of Chic at Retail Stores: Angela Ahrendts, Apple’s senior vice president of retail, got a private demonstration of the fancy wireless speaker, the Phantom, and its sound quality seven weeks ago. On the spot, she said she wanted the space podlike device, which starts at $1,990, to be sold in Apple’s retail stores. This week, the Phantom will appear in 14 Apple stores in the United States, and the company is discussing how widely to roll out the product next year. The device will get the sort of prominent display treatment that is typically reserved in Apple stores for the company’s Beats audio accessories. The move is an indication of how Ms. Ahrendts, who started at Apple last year, is changing the playbook at some of the iPhone maker’s stores this holiday season and the direction she’s going in: ultraluxe. Apple’s stores typically spotlight the company’s devices, with the most expensive audio accessories topping out in the hundreds of dollars. The Phantom is the first high-end non-Apple gadget that Ms. Ahrendts, the former chief executive of the fashion house Burberry, has brought in since she took the job. It buttresses some of her other recent moves to create more of a luxury Apple retail experience, including initiating private try-on appointments for the most expensive Apple watches, reducing the numbers and types of accessories that are sold, and pushing manufacturers to make special packaging for gadgets carried in Apple’s stores. Apple has traditionally sold the most expensive accessories online only, like the $2,700 B&O BeoPlay A9 MKII speaker. “I asked Tim a very simple question: Why do we do it this way?” she said of her boss, Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive. Mr. Cook told her he didn’t know, she saidAlphabet, the company formerly known as Google, revealed a new name for the company’s Life Sciences division: Verily. Alphabet made the branding announcement with a video and a company website that went live on Monday. In it, Verily laid out a multidisciplinary approach to health and longevity, describing disease as a “continuum” that will be fought with experts from different fields and divisions working on hardware such as medical devices, software that might use algorithms to look for health patterns, as well as clinical studies like the Baseline Study of health and disease. The new name for the business is part of Google’s transition to a holding company structure under the parent entity dubbed Alphabet. For those keeping track of Alphabet’s soup of operating companies, Verily is the division that was the Life Sciences unit of Google’s X lab. Life Sciences “graduated” from Google X shortly after Google announced the Alphabet structure. Verily means “truth” or “truly” and the name, according to the spokeswoman, is meant to underscore the company’s mission to”reveal a true picture of health and disease.” Background: For years, Google has been entering new businesses, but struggling to recreate the success it enjoys in search and advertising. In August, Google announced that it would create a new org structure where its traditional businesses (search, advertising, YouTube, maps) would continue to be called Google, while all other businesses would become separate companies. The parent of all of these companies would be called Alphabet. The idea is that the new businesses would get more room to grow and innovate like startups, while the traditional businesses would get higher stock market valuations because of their incredible profitability and size. Verizon Would Explore Yahoo Deal If It Made Sense, CFO Says: Verizon would explore a possible acquisition of Yahoo! if a deal made sense, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said. Shammo, speaking at an investor conference in New York Monday, said that while it still wasn’t clear what Yahoo’s board has planned for the tech company, Verizon would take a look if it were to be offered up for sale. Yahoo directors met last week to discuss the viability of spinning off its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and whether to seek a buyer for Yahoo’s Web businesses. Verizon acquired AOL for $4.4 billion earlier this year as part of a push into mobile video advertising. Yahoo owns online sports sites, financial and general news and advertising technology including BrightRoll, which Verizon might find attractive at the right price. Impediments to a sale of Yahoo are the fate of its stake in Alibaba, a Chinese e-commerce giant, and the tax implications of a sale of that unit. Dropbox Shuts Down E-Mail and Photo Apps as It Gets Back to Businesses: The cloud storage company is increasing its focus on corporate customers as it tries to develop a sustainable business. Cloud storage provider Dropbox is killing off two applications it introduced to much fanfare, including a photo-sharing app released last year. The San Francisco company has placed more focus recently on creating tools companies are willing to pay for, while these apps were designed with everyday consumers in mind. The photo app, called Carousel, offered to automatically back up photos stored on a phone and display them alongside images already stored in a Dropbox account. The other app, an e-mail and task manager called Mailbox, came through an acquisition Dropbox made in 2013. The company said in a statement that features from each app will make their way into other Dropbox services. After achieving a valuation of $10 billion in a financing round last year, Dropbox is under pressure to increase its revenue and eventually go public or sell itself. Fidelity Investments and BlackRock wrote down the stakes of their Dropbox investments this year. Dropbox has tried to straddle two missions in recent years: to build a product beloved by consumers and to create a service that satisfies businesses' unique needs. The former strategy, which includes these apps, has fallen somewhat out of favor since the company brought in Chief Operating Officer Dennis Woodside from Google last year. Both Carousel and Mailbox competed unsuccessfully with much more popular services from Google and Apple. Mailbox will shut down on Feb. 26, 2016, and Carousel on March 31, 2016. Airbnb Officially Confirms Gargantuan $1.5 Billion Funding Round in SEC Filing:  Home rental service and unofficial sharing economy mascot Airbnb has made its $1.5 billion funding round official in an SEC document today. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the equity offering back in June, writing that it set the company’s value at more than $25 billion. The round makes Airbnb the third-most valuable privately held tech company in the world, after Uber (worth $62.5 billion) and the Chinese phone maker Xiaomi (valued at around $45 billion). Airbnb’s lead investors in this round were reportedly General Atlantic, Hillhouse Capital Group and Tiger Global Management, which together composed a third of the Airbnb shares sold. Airbnb is raising giant sums like this and putting off an IPO because the startup — like other highly-valued darlings of Silicon Valley — wants to put its resources into emerging markets around the world, especially China. The company is also busy putting out political fires in its more well-saturated markets like San Francisco and New York City, and is in the process of building a (likely expensive) global political organizing operation to protect its revenue streams. Onstage at the Code Conference earlier this year, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky said that he thinks an IPO is still a couple years away. Mother-Son Team Demo Translate For Code: Meet Roslyn Scott and Dalton Scott, a mother and son team who just demoed a neat idea for making code more accessible, here at the Disrupt London 2015 hackathon. Their hack, called the Human Code Project, uses several IBM Watson APIs, including its Natural Language Classifier, to power a search interface for translating JavaScript code terms into plain English. It’s designed much like a language translation interface, so someone who’s trying to understand what a piece of code is doing can search for a particular Javascript word or phrase within that code to see a definition of what a term such as ‘onclick’ might mean in that particular context. The interface returns a percentage breakdown of how confident the system is in its definition for that term. During the hackathon they uploaded a training document to Watson, and created two classifier sets — one for definitions of code terms and one for phrases, explains Roslyn.Samsung to finally pay Apple $548 million in patent dispute: Samsung fought until the bitter end to avoid paying Apple, but the company now says it will finally hand over the more than $548 million it owes for infringing the patents and designs of its biggest smartphone rival. In papers filed in federal court in San Jose, California on Thursday, Samsung Electronics said it will make the payment by Dec. 14 if Apple sends an invoice on Friday. Asked if it had done so, Apple declined to comment on Friday. The payment comes after a U.S. appeals court last May reduced a $930 million judgment against Samsung by $382 million, stemming from a 2012 verdict for infringing Apple patents and copying the look of the iPhone. Another trial over remaining damages relating to some of Samsung's infringing products in the case is set to go ahead next spring. Even though the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. had authorized damages to Apple in May, Samsung again appealed the final figure to the same court, and was rebuffed twice more. Now agreeing to pay, Samsung told the San Jose court that it expects to be reimbursed if it eventually succeeds in a forthcoming appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court over its liability for copying the patented designs of the surface, bezel and user interface of the iPhone, which accounted for $399 million of the total award.Google Ventures Owns Part of Several Unicorns, but the Biggest (and Trickiest) Is Uber: The venture firm has $2.4 billion under management and has invested in 300 companies, a number of which have secured billion dollar valuations (a.k.a. unicorn status). According to new figures released on Sunday, the VC shop added 39 new startups in 2015, including significant bets in commerce (Jet.com), biotech (Editas) and agricultural software (Farmer’s Business Network), a new terrain. Most investments during the year, nearly a third, went into life sciences and health companies, followed by consumer and enterprise startups. It is hard to anticipate that any of these investments will be bigger than Uber — in dollars sunk in or payout. In 2013, Kara Swisher reported that Google Ventures spent $250 million for 1.8 million Series C-1 preferred shares in the ride-hailing app startup. At a then $3.5 billion valuation, that put its stake just north of 7 percent. (Google Ventures declined to comment on this or the size of any other investment stakes.) Uber is now reportedly en route to a valuation of $62.5 billion. Its many subsequent rounds since 2013 have likely diluted Google Ventures’ share, although a source familiar with the deal terms says not by much. Even at the low end of analyst estimation, around 2 percent ownership, the Google Ventures share would, at Uber’s current valuation, hit fivefold return. And who knows how Uber will climb before an IPO. Increasingly, however, it’s a sticky situation. As Uber balloons, many of its ambitions — in mobile app integrations, mapping and self-driving cars — are aimed squarely at Google. The startup is partly driven, several sources said, by a concern the search giant could one day clobber it. Google should be worried if it can’t.Uber Valuation Put at $62.5 Billion After a New Investment Round - Tiger Global, Investor in Uber's Rivals, Joins In: Uber’s fund-raising efforts are showing no signs of slowing down. The company, based in San Francisco, is close to completing the raising of a $2.1 billion round of venture capital, according to people briefed on the company’s plans, the company’s single largest round to date. Once completed, the investment will value the company at $62.5 billion, according to three people briefed on the plans, securing Uber’s place as the world’s most valuable private start-up. Tiger Global Management participated in the newest round, led by its partner Lee Fixel, as did T. Rowe Price, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the terms are still private. Talks of the funding plans were previously reported by The New York Times in October. On Thursday, Bloomberg News reported the $62.5 billion valuation. Competition is intensifying in the global ride-hailing market, as rivals like Lyft, Didi Kuaidi and other companies raise billions of dollars in to expand as quickly as possible. Lyft, another ride-hailing start-up, is in talks to raise a further $500 million in funding, according to four people briefed on the round, which could value the company at roughly $4 billion. Didi Kuaidi, to date, has raised more than $4 billion in private investment. The participation of Tiger Global, however, is particularly interesting. Tiger Global is an investor in Ola and GrabTaxi, two of Uber’s largest competitors in India and Southeast Asia. It is perhaps the first time a major institutional investor participated in the rounds of both Uber and its major competitors. And on Thursday, Ola and GrabTaxi announced a strategic partnership with Lyft, which is also based in San Francisco and is Uber’s major competitor in the United States.Why would anyone want to buy Yahoo? Now, that question may be the key to understanding the parlor game of rumor and conjecture currently swirling around the company. Depending on which speculating analyst you talk to, Verizon, Microsoft, Time Inc., Comcast, AT&T, and even IAC — the company that owns Tinder, OkCupid and Match.com — could all jump in as potential buyers.To be specific, what we're talking about is a possible sale of Yahoo's \"core business,\" but even that term belies the dizzying range of things that Yahoo actually does. Is it a search company? A media company? An advertising company?In truth, it is all of those things, which is one reason we've seen so many names come out of the corporate woodwork. But it turns out there's one metric that makes Yahoo really attractive here: The number of eyeballs that Yahoo commands on a monthly basis.This might seem obvious in an era where clickbait and traffic seem to rule with an iron grip. But if you take Yahoo apart piece by piece, you start to understand why snapping up the company would benefit some firms more than others.Take Microsoft, for instance. It actually tried to buy Yahoo before, in 2008.Microsoft was worried about Google dominating a new market, search. Microsoft tried to build its own competitor, Bing (then known as Windows Live Search), but it didn't take off with users. So Microsoft figured it would buy the No. 2 player, Yahoo, and combine its search and search ad business with Microsoft's.Fast-forward to today, and Bing is no longer lagging behind Yahoo. In fact, what you have is a market where Bing actually covers more than 20 percent of search, compared to Yahoo's 13 percent. Both have been helped, no doubt, by a joint partnership on search.Combining the two might get Microsoft a bit closer to Google (which commands 64 percent of the market), but it still wouldn't be within striking distance. And Microsoft would also be inheriting all of Yahoo's other Internet businesses, potentially slowing the company down as it tries to execute a shift toward offering more cloud services, especially for corporate clients.But let's shift to some of the other names that have been floated. Three are providers of fixed or mobile Internet — four, if you count Softbank, the Japanese parent company of Sprint. That isn't a coincidence; Internet providers increasingly view original online content as the way to turn their networks into cash cows. Carrying data over simple pipes is no longer as lucrative as before.Lyft Joins With Asian Rivals to Compete With Uber: The anti-Uber global alliance of ride-hailing companies has now officially taken shape. On Thursday, Lyft, a ride-hailing start-up based in the United States, announced a coalition with GrabTaxi, Ola and Didi Kuaidi, three of the largest ride-hailing companies in Asia. Under a partnership, the companies can operate in one another’s home countries, forging new pathways for each in markets they have yet to tap into. Many of Uber’s competitors are far smaller and operate in just one or two markets. Lyft, which is currently seeking $500 million in funding at a valuation of $4 billion, operates in more than 60 cities in the United States, for instance. By banding together, the companies aim to achieve more scale and more service adoption in relatively short amounts of time. Partnerships are less expensive than having to spend to establish operations in multiple markets. The companies declined to reveal financial details of their partnership. The alliance has been forming over the last few months. In September, Lyft teamed with Didi, the Chinese ride-hailing behemoth, to provide service to Chinese Didi Kuaidi app users who enter the United States. The move also lets Lyft users find rides in China using the Lyft app; the requests are fulfilled by Didi Kuaidi drivers. Ola is a ride-hailing company in India, and GrabTaxi operates in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. Under the partnership, Lyft users traveling to India will be able to open the Lyft app there and have local rides supplied by Ola. In Southeast Asian countries, Lyft will have a similar arrangement with GrabTaxi.Startup Founders Sound Just as Pessimistic About a Bubble as Tech Journalists: There has been a lot of kvetching of late about whether or not we’re in the middle of another tech bubble, and most of the pontificating has come from venture capitalists and tech media. But what do people who launch startups actually think? According to First Round Capital’s new State of Startups Report — a survey of more than 500 founders of VC-backed companies — founders are also largely convinced we’re in a tech bubble of some sort. First Round’s findings indicate that startup leaders are having a harder time raising money and that they think it’s only going to get tougher. The report also says they believe bitcoin is one really overhyped technology, whereas self-driving cars don’t get enough attention. We’ve embedded the report in a slideshow below, but here are some key facts and figures from First Round: 80 percent of founders say they were able to raise what they wanted to in their last rounds, but virtually all of them say that it will be harder to do so in the next year. 73 percent of startup founders believe we are in a bubble, but enterprise startup leaders are twice as likely to say we aren’t (twice as many enterprise tech founders also say they’ll be profitable in the next year). No one has a clue about what the IPO market will look like in 2016: One third says there will be more IPOs, one third says it’ll be about the same and one third says there will be fewer. 90 percent of founders expect to see more tech mergers and acquisitions over the next year, which is also what’s generally expected by industry analysts and experts.Crazy Like a Box: Going Public Can Give Start-Ups Outsize Power: In early 2014, when the cloud storage company Box filed for an initial public offering, many on Wall Street looked at its numbers and laughed. Box’s revenues were soaring, but its losses were growing nearly as quickly. It was pouring vast sums into sales and marketing, it had less than a year of cash remaining, and executives did not anticipate making a profit for years. When Box eventually went public this January — after raising another round of private funds to delay its I.P.O. — its stock price briefly surged but has since lost about 40 percent of its value. The company reported on Wednesday that in the third fiscal quarter, it again increased sales, and it projected slightly higher sales in 2016 than it had previously expected. Now, with a stock market valuation of about $1.7 billion, Box is technically in league with the “unicorn” private companies valued at more than a billion dollars — but compared with some of those highflying start-ups, it could easily be mistaken for a pony. Dropbox, a cloud storage competitor that remains private, was valued at about $10 billion in its last fund-raising round. To many in Silicon Valley, Box’s inauspicious debut on the stock market, like several other recent tech offerings, serves as a cautionary tale. While floating an I.P.O. was once seen as a rite of passage in Silicon Valley, in the last few years it has become a much bemoaned annoyance to many tech founders. Companies are waiting longer to go public, and thanks to a surge of money from hedge funds and mutual funds looking to get in on the start-up scene, young companies have been given resources to stay private for years on end. Go out to the public markets before you’re bulletproof, the thinking goes, and you’ll get crushed. No one wants to be the next Etsy, Hortonworks or Box, all of which now trade below their I.P.O. price. But what if Box gets the last laugh? Despite the company’s languishing stock price, it’s possible that a few years from now, many in the Valley may come to look back on Box’s I.P.O. as a masterly timed bit of corporate strategy — an initially painful move that ultimately rewarded investors, improved employees’ financial stability, provided executives with independence from unpredictable private investors and pushed the company to adopt a more structured path toward profitability. To understand why, it helps to look at the market for private tech funding, and how it is affected by public valuations. Several unicorns have recently discovered that taking money from mutual funds and other large investors brings surprising public scrutiny. The mutual fund company Fidelity and others must regularly report assessments of their private-company holdings, and lately they’ve calculated that start-ups like Snapchat and Dropbox are worth less than what the funds paid for them. Dropbox’s valuation, in fact, may now be tied directly to Box’s, since large investors look at comparable public companies to help determine the value of their private investments. The same logic applies to employees. If you’re an engineer looking to work at a cloud storage company, you could go to Dropbox, where you’ll receive stock options at a lofty $10 billion valuation that you’ll have a hard time turning into actual money. Or you can go to Box, in which you’ll get shares at a relatively reasonable valuation that can also be traded on the public market.Ballmer Chides Microsoft Over Cloud Revenue Disclosures:  One major Microsoft Corp. investor wasn’t happy with the level of disclosure Wednesday at the company’s annual shareholder meeting: Steve Ballmer. The company should disclose profit margins and sales for its cloud and hardware businesses, Microsoft’s former chief executive officer said. “It’s sort of a key metric -- if they talk about it as key to the company, they should report it,” Ballmer, who is the company’s biggest individual shareholder, told Bloomberg at the software maker’s annual meeting in Bellevue, Washington. Microsoft reports an annualized revenue run rate -- or sales at a certain point in time carried out to a yearly rate -- for its commercial cloud business and has said it is aiming to reach $20 billion on that basis by 2018. Ballmer, who handed the reins to Satya Nadella in 2014, derided the use of run rate as “bulls---.” “They should report the revenue, not the run rate,” he said. Margin -- a measure of profitability -- is important because while gross margins for software are very high, they are far lower for things like hardware and cloud services, Ballmer said. Microsoft also said in April it would end its fiscal year with a commercial cloud gross margin of 44 percent. Though it reports revenue and margin for some of its cloud businesses, it doesn’t provide a total sales number for cloud. Ballmer said he has discussed the issue with the company and that after almost two years out of the CEO job, he can’t even guess what these numbers are. “We enjoy a regular dialogue with Steve, and welcome his input and feedback, as we do from our other investors.” said Chris Suh, Microsoft’s general manager for investor relations. Ballmer also criticized Nadella’s answer to an audience member questioning the lack of key apps, like one for Starbucks, on the company’s Windows Phone. Nadella responded by citing the company’s plan to appeal to Windows developers by allowing them to write universal applications that work on computers, phones and tablets, targeting a larger array of devices than just Microsoft’s handsets that have just a single-digit share of the mobile market. “That won’t work,” Ballmer commented as Nadella spoke. Instead, the company needs to enable Windows Phones “to run Android apps,” he said.Uber launches taxi-hailing button for third-party apps:  Online taxi-hailing service Uber [UBER.UL] said it would allow third-party app developers to add a 'Ride Request' button within their apps for free. Developers would need to register their apps on Uber's website to get access to the code to add the button, which users can tap to request a ride. To entice developers to use the feature, Uber said it would pay $5 for every new U.S.-based customer that uses the button from the developer's app. Earlier this year, Uber had partnered with Zomato, an India-based restaurant finder, to add a \"Ride there with Uber\" button on the restaurant page. Last year, Google Maps also integrated Uber within its app to allow users to book a ride.Yahoo shares spike 6% on reports board to weigh selling core business, Marissa Mayer's future role: WSJ. The board of Web giant Yahoo is set to discuss the company's future, and that of high-profile Chief Executive Marissa Mayer, when it meets this week, The Wall Street Journal reported late on Tuesday. People familiar with the matter told the newspaper the board was expected to discuss during meetings from Wednesday through Friday whether to proceed with a plan to spin off more than $30 billion in shares of Alibaba or find a buyer for its core business of web properties, or both. Yahoo's core business, which includes popular services like Yahoo Mail and its news and sports sites, could attract private equity firms, media and telecom companies or firms like Softbank  analysts have said in the past. The news comes as Mayer faces growing pressure over the company's performance. Mayer came to Yahoo after a long stint at Google. The company's shares were up more than 6 percent in extended trading.Zuckerberg Vows to Daughter He’ll Donate 99% of His Facebook Shares: Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and chief executive of Facebook, announced on Tuesday that he and his wife would give 99 percent of their Facebook shares “during our lives” — holdings currently worth more than $45 billion — to charitable purposes. The pledge was made in an open letter to their newborn daughter, Max, who was born about a week ago. Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, said they were forming a new organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, to manage the money, through an unusual limited liability corporate structure. “Our initial areas of focus will be personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities,” they wrote. Mr. Zuckerberg’s charitable plans are the latest indication of a growing interest in philanthropy among Silicon Valley’s young billionaires, who unlike previous generations of business tycoons, appear eager to spread their wealth while they are still young. Mr. Zuckerberg is 31, and Dr. Chan is 30. Yet they are entering largely uncharted waters with a charity effort of such scale. They have not yet detailed how the money will be spent and the pace in which the money will be given out indicates they plan to take their time.AppDynamics Raises $158M; Now Valued At $1.9 Billion: Last month, based on an SEC filing, we told you that seven-year-old, San Francisco-based AppDynamics had raised a fresh $83.4 million in funding as part of a round that was targeting up to $150 million. Turns out the company met that target and then some. CEO David Wadhwani — who joined the firm in September after spending more than a decade as an executive at Adobe, including as its digital chief — says the company has just closed on $158 million in a round led by General Catalyst and Altimeter Capital. Other participants in the round include Adage Capital, Industry Ventures, Goldman Sachs, and Cross Creek Advisors, as well as earlier backers Institutional Venture Partners, Greylock Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners. AppDynamics makes software to monitor the performance of business applications, competing with some traditional firms like IBM, as well as younger outfits like New Relic, which went public last December and has seen relatively steady stock performance since. (New Relic, which raised $214 million in venture funding, has a current market cap of $1.8 billion.) AppDynamics had previously raised roughly $206 million in debt and equity, including a $120 million round — $70 million equity and $50 million of debt — that closed in July of last year. At the time of the funding announcement, the company told VentureBeat that the money represented “pre-IPO growth financing.” Asked today what this new round means, Wadhwani said he “won’t speculate on the exact timing” of an IPO but added, “I was brought in to take this company public, and that’s what I intend to do.” The new funding, he said, “represents freedom. We can [execute on our plans for the company] on this money and effectively choose when we want to go public.” Wadhwani declined to discuss the company’s post-money valuation, but a source close to the company pegs it at $1.9 billion.In a Global Market for Hacking Talent, Argentines Stand Out: Want to learn how to break into the computerized heart of a medical device or an electronic voting machine? Maybe a smartphone or even a car? Thanks to the legacy of military rule and a culture of breaking rules of all sorts, Argentina has become one of the best places on earth to find people who could show you how. As Silicon Valley’s talent war has gone global, particularly for those skilled at breaking into things, this Latin American nation has become a rich recruiting ground for corporations and foreign governments. Companies need hackers to help defend against online criminals and state-sponsored spies. And as the world’s critical infrastructure moves online and the threat of war moves into cyberspace, governments are desperate to acquire hackers’ tools. Within Latin America, Brazil has become known in recent years as the world leader in Internet banking fraud. But Argentina’s hackers have a reputation for creativity. In particular, they are known for their ability to find so-called zero-day flaws, which are unpatched holes in widely used technology that can be used to spy on or even destroy adversaries’ computer networks. Technology companies like Apple, Facebook and Google have encrypted their products and services so that in many cases the only way to monitor a target’s communications is to hack directly into its device. As a result, there is a new urgency among governments in acquiring zero-day exploits. A mix of executives from around the world, government officials, contractors and — or so it was rumored — spies gathered here in October in an industrial building converted into a cultural center to watch hacking done the Argentine way at the 11th annual EkoParty, the largest hacking conference in Latin America. Long before foreign companies came calling, hacking things was a life skill in Argentina, a way to get by through decades of repressive military rule and a volatile economy. Argentines have a saying, “atado con alambre,” which translates roughly as “held together with wire,” to describe the inventive nature of so many here who learned to do much with little. The country still has one foot in the tech industry’s past because of stringent import rules. Amazon will not ship to your door here. BlackBerry has more market share here than Apple. A new iPhone costs $2,000 or more on MercadoLibre, an online auction site, but many iPhone owners said they had been able to persuade a friend traveling from abroad to sneak one through customs. To get their hands on the latest, greatest devices, Argentines often have to think like a hacker — or even become one. “You make do without resources, without high-end technology, with poor Wi-Fi connections,” said Sergio Berensztein, an Argentine political analyst. “We improvise creative solutions, for lack of other options, and many have applied these same procedures to the technical industry.”FAA Permit for Drone Flight School May Help Amazon, Google Speed Up Delivery Plans: The Federal Aviation Administration is plotting how to regulate drones. Tech companies with plans for drones — Amazon, Google, DJI, GoPro and a bevy of others looking to tap a potential multi-billion dollar market — are itching for the FAA to get on with it already. Last week, the agency made a small legal maneuver that advocates hope indicates more leniency to come on the commercial applications of drones. The FAA authorized the Kansas State University Polytechnic campus to train students and outside companies on flying unmanned aircraft. This type of authorization, called a Section 333 exemption, is common; construction sites, news outlets and disaster relief groups have received them. Amazon scored one in April. The notable difference here is in how close the FAA lets drones get to people. Even with flight authorization, drones must stay 500 feet from people, unless the craft meet some stringent safety and logistics requirements. The only exception had been on closed film and TV sets, which deploy drones for movie magic. But the FAA lifted the 500-foot restriction for the Kansas school, even though it didn’t ask for the specific closed-set exemption.Target and PayPal Sites Report Problems on Cyber Monday: Cyber Monday, the online version of Black Friday, is not immune to traffic jams of shoppers rushing to take advantage of post-Thanksgiving sales. Some of the most popular websites experienced an overload on Monday, similar to a crowd pushing its way into an already packed brick-and-mortar store. Shoppers were for a period of time unable to gain access to the site of Target, the discount chain,and PayPal, the online payments processing service. Both are now back online after an onslaught that reflects the shifting trends in the way consumers are looking for shopping bargains. Foot Locker, Groupon and Victoria’s Secret also experienced brief outages or slowdowns Monday afternoon, according to Catchpoint Systems, a web monitoring firm. In a statement on Monday, Target said it was experiencing its biggest online volumes ever in response to a 15 percent online discount that it had announced previously. Visitors to the site early Monday got a message saying: “Please hold tight. So sorry, but high traffic’s causing delays. If you wouldn’t mind holding, we’ll refresh automatically & get things going ASAP.” According to a statement from Target, the company said it placed online shoppers in a queue in order to manage the volume of users, but it then allowed them to keep trying to gain access by refreshing their browser. A heat map on downdetector.com showed most of the problems with PayPal were reported in North America and Europe. Problems started around 8:30 a.m. Eastern time. PayPal said in an emailed statement that the “brief, intermittent interruption” in service was resolved. It did not provide a reason. The holiday buying frenzy has evolved over the years as more stores offer sales before and sometimes on Thanksgiving Day. It has also shifted away from physical stores as Americans have increasingly turned to online shopping. For many people, Monday was their first day back at work after the long Thanksgiving weekend, so some shopping was presumably being done surreptitiously while at work.Thanksgiving Final Results – OmniChannel Strikes Back: This morning we are releasing the final results from Thanksgiving 2015. What stands out is the Omnichannel players with stores and online marketplaces (Best Buy, Sears, etc.) did extremely well.  This indicates that these ‘Brick and Clicks’ retailers were really able to tie their store and online promotions together with great success. This data is date-shifted to compare Thanksgiving this year  (Nov 26) vs. last year (Nov 27).  In summary, Thanksgiving 2015 blew the doors off, coming in at 43.4% y/y growth compared to 20.1% last year – more than twice the rate of growth.  The trick is while we know that Thanksgiving 2015 was very strong, we don’t know if this will continue through the entire Cyber Five and through all of Holiday 15, or if consumers are shopping much earlier than last year and will taper off as we get past Thanksgiving.  Omnichannel marketplaces led the pack with Google Shopping and Amazon also outperforming. From a device perspective, Smartphones were 58% of traffic compared to last year’s Thanksgiving 35% and a new high water mark for this device type in our data.  From an order perspective, smartphone came in at 37% which was also more than double last year, although conversion rates continue to lag desktop and tablet considerably. Conclusion: consumers not only increased their Thanksgiving sales, but they utilized their smartphones heavily and favored omnichannel retailers.Judge Dismisses Yelp Suit Brought by Shareholders: Yelp won the dismissal of a lawsuit by shareholders who claimed they had been fraudulently misled about the authenticity and quality of its reviews, and who accused Yelp of manipulating those reviews to favor paying advertisers. In a Nov. 24 decision, United States District Court Judge Jon S. Tigar in San Francisco said reasonable investors would understand that not all Yelp reviews are real, particularly given the company’s admission that its technology to screen user-generated content is not foolproof. In April, Judge Tigar dismissed an earlier version of the complaint, which sought class-action status. He said the plaintiffs could not sue again because any amendment would be “futile.” Yelp lets users rate restaurants and other businesses on a five-star scale. Positive reviews can bolster sales and negative reviews can harm sales, especially if viewers perceive the reviews as unbiased. Shareholders led by Joseph Curry accused Yelp of inflating its share price by falsely promoting the reliability of its reviews, as part of a calculated strategy to extort businesses into buying ads or making payments in exchange for removing bad or fake reviews. But the judge said only 11 of the complaints accused Yelp of offering to manipulate reviews in exchange for fees, a small number.India’s Grofers Grabs $120M To Bring Offline Merchants Into The On-Demand World: The race for on-demand delivery services in India is on, and today one of the bigger startups in the market has picked up a large cash injection as it goes for pole position. Grofers, an Instacart-style app that links up with local, offline merchants to delivery groceries, medicine, flowers, and other daily items to customers, has raised $120 million led by new investor SoftBank. The Series C round also included existing backers DST’s Apoletto Managers, Tiger Global and Instacart investor Sequoia Capital. Grofers CEO and co-founder Albinder Dhindsa and SoftBank have both directly confirmed the round and investors to TechCrunch. Grofers has been on a fundraising tear to aid its expansion. This is the third round raised by the company this year alone, after earlier rounds of $10 million and $35 million. It brings the total to just under $166 million including an earlier seed round. Japan’s Softbank has been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars of investment into Indian startups like Ola, Snapdeal and more, and as part of this round it will take a seat on Grofers’ board. The Times of India, which first reported the raise, cites sources that say Grofers now has a post-money valuation of over $300 million. Dhindsa, who cofounded the company with Saurabh Kumar, would not comment on the valuation and said he hadn’t even wanted to make this fundraise public. “Very honestly it’s just a distraction for the team,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re in the middle of trying to build a business.” Today, that business is currently live in 26 cities in India, with some 1.6 million downloads of the mobile apps that are used to order its services. While Grofers looks on the surface like another Instacart clone, there is more going on under the hood. The company originally started as a B2B provider of a supply chain platform it built to help larger brands distribute consumables to smaller merchants, and for those smaller merchants who are almost completely offline to better keep track of their stock. “In India, retail is very unorganised, so we see an opportunity in helping small merchants come online,” Dhindsa says. Still, perhaps to tap into a more mass market prospect, it recently pivoted — or expanded may be the more accurate term — to make its business more consumer-facing, by offering those small, offline businesses an additional service: a way of showing their stock to consumers, who can order and have items delivered. Typically, Grofers offers some features to businesses for free, such as its inventory management system. It then takes a cut on other business software and services, as well as on the delivery, which can range at prices to consumers of between $1 for groceries to $0.40 for medicines (not as cheap sounding in India as it may be in the U.S.). Dhindsa says that the funding will be used to continue growing its supply-chain management development, but also to continue building out its last-mile infrastructure. Today, Grofers uses a mix of its own employees and contractors to deliver goods. Perhaps cleverly, it has chosen not to make delivery the cost-and-profit focus of its whole operation. In fact, it’s even considered partnering with others for that aspect of its business.Xiaomi's $45 Billion Valuation Seen `Unfeasible' as Growth Cools: Things were going so well for Xiaomi Corp. Customers were lining up, investors were swooning and the Beijing-based startup closed funding at a $45 billion valuation. That was last year. Now the high-flying smartphone maker is stumbling. Founder Lei Jun’s latest business, one of China’s most exciting startup stories of the past few years, is likely to miss its own goal of selling 80 million smartphones this year, according to two people with knowledge of its production plans. Suppliers also cut their internal targets for Xiaomi in anticipation of the shortfall, they said. Xiaomi’s falter shows the startup’s challenge in trying to maintain momentum after a meteoric ascent past Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. in China. Investors bought into the company’s story of youthful disruption and online sales, yet the subsequent lowering of China’s growth target and the copying of its sales strategy by rivals have neutralized Xiaomi’s first-mover advantage, putting its high price tag in doubt. \"All those expectations of growth aren’t being realized, which now makes that $45 billion valuation unfeasible,\" said Alberto Moel, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein in Hong Kong. \"The argument was that their business is kind of like Apple and they’re growing very fast, but they’re no longer growing so fast and they’re not as good as Apple.\" Domestic shipments of Xiaomi smartphones, including its premium Mi 4 and more economical Redmi series, dropped 8 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, its first-ever decline, according to researcher Canalys. IHS, another research firm, estimates that Xiaomi shipments dropped 3.9 percent, barely maintaining the lead over Huawei Technologies Co. That’s a big change from the bold growth projections used to justify Xiaomi’s tag as one of the world’s most-valuable technology startups. In March of last year, Lei predicted selling 100 million smartphones in 2015. Through the first nine months of this year, Xiaomi shipped about 53 million smartphones. With its optimistic forecast, Xiaomi secured $1.1 billion in December from investors including GIC Pte., All-Stars Investment Ltd. and DST. Xiaomi drew comparisons to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company that months earlier held the largest initial public offering ever.All In: Why Nikesh Arora Bet $483 Million on SoftBank's Future: It began late one night this year when he and Son were talking about people’s tolerance for risk and how it tends to decline over time. Arora took a chance as a kid by leaving India for the U.S. with only $200 in cash, but he had since gone on to a lucrative career. So Son prodded him. “Masa said, ‘How much risk appetite do you have?”’ Arora says. “‘Do you believe you can transform SoftBank into a company two, three, five times its size? Now is the time to take the risk.”’ A week later, Arora came back with a plan to buy 60 billion yen ($483 million at the time) in SoftBank shares, more than any insider purchase by an executive in Japan in at least 12 years, according to Bloomberg data. He would become the company’s second-largest individual shareholder and borrow heavily to do it. Arora says investors don’t yet appreciate what SoftBank is becoming. The company has been battered recently because of struggles at two major holdings, the China e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and the U.S. wireless operator Sprint Corp. SoftBank is still valued at less than the public shares it owns, meaning investors deem its operating businesses practically worthless.Arora professes not to be worried. He says investors will come around once the company makes progress in reviving Sprint, lets Alibaba recover and demonstrates that it’s more than a Japanese telecommunications company with a spotty investment record.“I’m very relaxed,” Arora said. “I’m here for at least the next 10 years.”  Arora was hired last year after a decade at Google Inc. and promoted to president in June. Since then, he has been quietly building his own operation within SoftBank, an investment arm that will take stakes in technology companies around the world. Though SoftBank put money into startups for decades, including a tumultuous foray during the dot-com bust, the effort had dwindled in recent years to what Son called a “hobby” next to his wireless and broadband businesses. Arora is reviving the venture push and making it much more ambitious. He is hiring a team of 15 to 20 outsiders and plans to put about $3 billion into startups each year. Arora’s recruits, from companies such as Google and LinkedIn Corp., are hand-picked for the expertise they can offer startups in key areas like personnel, product development and acquisitions. He says SoftBank will hold a competitive advantage by operating at a financial strata few can reach. He plans to make five to 10 investments a year of $100 million to $1 billion. The idea is to back startups that have proven products and need to expand -- the rapid phase of growth Arora helped manage at Google.Morgan Stanley Said Struggling to Sell EBay Enterprise Deal Loan: Morgan Stanley is struggling to unload $640 million of loans backing the private-equity buyout of EBay Inc.’s enterprise business after investors shunned the debt, according to people with knowledge of the deal. The bank has been trying to sell the loans since mid-October and continues to hold the debt even after EBay said on Nov. 2 that the sale was completed. Morgan Stanley has discussed a steeper discount to lure buyers and has been probing investors in recent days about the price at which they may be willing to buy the debt, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. One concern investors have raised is that the company’s projected earnings may be too optimistic. Buyout targets often make adjustments to forecast earnings, called add-backs, that can reduce a borrower’s leverage.Zenefits Under Investigation For Allegedly Allowing Unlicensed Brokers To Sell Health Insurance: Cloud HR platform Zenefits may have allowed salespeople to illegally act as insurance agents in at least seven states. According to a BuzzFeed investigative report, the startup let unlicensed brokers sell health insurance, leading to at least one commissioner to investigate in Washington State. Those unlicensed solicitations go back to at least the summer of 2014, and the Washington State office of the insurance commissioner started looking at the potential violations earlier this year, according to the report. This is not the first time Zenefits has faced legal scrutiny for possible insurance violations. The Utah Insurance Department took the startup to task over claims it was illegally giving insurance software away for free. Regulators at the time said that the company violated local laws and that it was unfair to traditional insurance brokers. Utah legislators threw out the complaint and let Zenefits get back to business after both the Utah House and Senate overwhelmingly voted to let the startup continue operations. The broker license violation looks a bit more serious and could be considered a Class B felony, under Washington State law. Violators may be subject to a prison sentence of up to 10 years as well as face a $20,000 fine. According to the report, Zenefits execs may have known about the violations and were aware of the consequences, but were prompted to get sales agents licensed in the state only after learning of the insurance commission’s investigation. State records show 22 agents became licensed brokers just days after the report said Zenefits realized there was a state inquiry. The startup has since launched a “license management system” to help track which sales agents are properly licensed.Apple plans to launch Apple Pay in China by February: WSJ Apple Inc (AAPL.O) plans to launch its mobile payment system Apple Pay in China by early February, the Wall Street Journal reported. The iPhone maker has struck deals recently with China's big four state-run banks, the newspaper reported late Monday, citing people familiar with the discussions. When launched, Apple Pay will mainly compete with Alipay, the online payment platform run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, and UnionPay, a state-controlled consortium that has a monopoly on all yuan payment cards issued and used in the country. Apple's plans could still face regulatory hurdles in China, where banking and e-commerce are overseen by a number of government agencies, WSJ said. Launched in the United States in October last year, Apple is bringing its payment service to China, the most important market for smartphones. The company's sales nearly doubled in Greater China in its fiscal fourth quarter from a year earlier. The amount Apple would make off such transactions has been a sticking point in negotiations to bring Apple Pay to China, the Journal quoted the people as saying.Alphabet Trying to Mix Heft With Start-Up Agility: Alphabet was created to separate Google, the search giant, from the constellation of appendages — the self-driving cars, the pharmaceutical company, the two venture capital funds — that many current and former employees say had made the company too sprawling to manage. The last three months of 2015 were the first quarter of the new holding company’s life, and the contours of the organization are starting to fall into place. It has hired new leaders, such as an auto industry veteran who was recently tapped to run the self-driving-car project. It is developing new processes, like an internal system that would have Alphabet companies pay Google for dull but important services like human resources, accounting or access to Google’s technological infrastructure, according to people familiar with the matter, something first reported by The Wall Street Journal. These are normal processes in large companies, used to make sure business units have a handle on expenses. But the company is also asking questions about how it might achieve the dream that has eluded so many other big companies: find a way to take advantage of its heft while being nimble like a start-up. Larry Page, Google’s co-founder and chief executive of Alphabet, has said that he wants his company to be a home for entrepreneurs. If the Alphabet concept plays out as advertised, company chiefs would have more autonomy to make strategic decisions on such matters as whom they hire and how they spend money, or even to raise their public profiles. But the pitch — in particular to acquisition targets — is also about what they would not have to do. They would not have to worry about building a large server infrastructure for their technology to run on. They would not have to worry about whether to use their money to hire another accountant or another engineer. In the case of more mature companies, they could skip the mounds of paperwork and reporting requirements that come with going public. That broad idea — that entrepreneurs do best when they are focused squarely on new technology rather than distracted by corporate building blocks that every company needs but also take lots of time to build — has taken root across Silicon Valley. It is why, in addition to money, venture capital firms now give their companies access to all kinds of marketing, sales and other services in hopes that their start-ups can more quickly become grown-ups. The first good glimpse of all this will come early next year, when Alphabet, for the first time, will separate Google’s search and advertising businesses from Alphabet’s more speculative divisions. But it will take months or years for Alphabet to figure out how to create the best of all possible worlds. If such a thing exists.The U.S releases draft regulations for drones: Proposed Regulations for Drones Are Released in the US: On Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration, scurrying to prepare for hundreds of thousands of more drones flying into the air, released a list of recommendations for how to better monitor recreational use of the machines. Under the proposal, most drone owners would have to register the machines with the federal government, which would place the information in a national database, the first such requirements. The recommendations, from a task force created by the agency, would be the biggest step yet by the government to deal with the proliferation of recreational drones, which are usually used for harmless purposes but have also been tools for mischief and serious wrongdoing, and pose a risk to airborne jets. The F.A.A. is widely expected to approve the bulk of the recommendations in the next month, just in time for Christmas. On Monday, the Federal Aviation Administration, scurrying to prepare for hundreds of thousands of more drones flying into the air, released a list of recommendations for how to better monitor recreational use of the machines.

The F.A.A. is widely expected to approve the bulk of the recommendations in the next month, just in time for Christmas. The government already has rules that limit the use of drones for commercial purposes, like delivering packages. But attention has turned to recreational use more recently, as drones, many of them the size of a laptop computer, have emerged as a must-have item for thousands of people. The Consumer Technology Association, a trade group, has estimated that 400,000 drones will be sold this holiday season in the United States.Deliveroo, an On-Demand Food Delivery Service, Raises $100 Million: On Monday, Deliveroo, an on-demand food delivery service based in London, announced that it had raised $100 million from investors, including DST Global, an early backer of Facebook, to help push the service into new markets, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. In total, the start-up has now raised roughly $200 million since its creation in 2012. Just about four months ago, Deliveroo raised $70 million to expand beyond its British roots. The company provides a one-size-fits-all offering for nontech savvy restaurants that includes food packaging, delivery drivers and other support so individuals can order the restaurants’ food through smartphones. As part of the new fund raising, Deliveroo expects to branch out into highly populated cities across Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore. Mr. Shu said there were no plans in the short term to offer the service in the United States, though the start-up now operates in 50 cities in 12 countries, primarily in Europe. While online food delivery companies like GrubHub and Just Eat, its European counterpart, have allowed people to order food through smartphones for years, a new generation of start-ups like Deliveroo are trying to extend that offering to restaurants that do not have their own delivery logistics. That group includes Delivery Hero, based in Berlin, which also offers a fleet of drivers and other logistical support to restaurants looking to expand into online orders. Delivery Hero is valued at $3.1 billion and operates across Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. Other tech companies, including Uber, the ride-booking service, now offer similar products. Yet for Mr. Shu of Deliveroo, these rivals are only a small fraction of his overall competition, which also includes people cooking for themselves at home and traditional restaurants.Once Valued At $4.5B,  LivingSocial Offers a Cautionary Tale to Today’s Unicorns: The first thing you see when walking into the headquarters of LivingSocial is row upon row of mostly empty desks, broken up by small street signs that employees once needed to find one another when the office teemed with people. One row, “BYFAD Lane,” was named after a start-up, BuyYourFriendADrink, which LivingSocial acquired to get into the daily deals business. Other signs, such as “Sky Diving Street,” were named for some of the hottest discount coupons that the company once provided. On a recent visit, some desks were piled high with boxes of employee belongings, the detritus left behind after a round of layoffs that eliminated one-fifth of the work force. In one refrigerator, the milk was six months old. The technology industry’s boom over the last few years has been defined by the rise of “unicorns,” the private companies that investors have valued at $1 billion or more. Before the term came into vogue, LivingSocial was among the biggest unicorns of its day. It now offers a glimpse of what some of today’s unicorns might look like several years down the road if things go awry. Just four years ago, LivingSocial and its larger rival Groupon grew rapidly on a simple pitch: The companies would match customers to local businesses with a daily deal in users’ inboxes, like half off at a local deli or a two-for-one massage promotion. LivingSocial and Groupon would take a cut of each transaction. Venture capitalists anointed daily deals as the way that the Internet would invade local business, and by late 2011 LivingSocial had raised more than $800 million and reached a valuation of $4.5 billion, according to data from the research firm VC Experts. The company counted Amazon and the mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price among its investors. LivingSocial spent heavily, blanketing the airwaves with TV ad campaigns. Riding a wave of momentum, the company explored going public. Today, LivingSocial is more unicorpse than unicorn. The company never filed for an initial public offering and consumer fervor for daily deals has cooled. T. Rowe Price has written down its stake in LivingSocial to nearly zero, data from Morningstar shows. The company’s work force has shrunk to around 800 employees from 4,500 at its peak in 2011. Groupon, which did go public, is trading at more than 85 percent below its I.P.O. price.Airbnb raises $100 million in funding, Valuation stays flat at $25.5B: source: Apartment-sharing startup Airbnb Inc has raised over $100 million in a new round of funding, a source close to the company said. Airbnb, once a startup selling cereal, expects to achieve profitability in 2016, the source said. Airbnb revenue doubled to $340 million in the third quarter on bookings of $2.2 billion, the source said. The company expects revenue of $900 million this year. The round was done at the same $25.5 billion valuation as the previous funding round over the summer, indicating that unicorns, or private tech companies worth $1 billion or more, are finding it tougher to convince investors to buy shares at continuously escalating valuations.Jawbone Lays Off 60, 15% Of Staff Globally, Closes NY Office. Some difficult news this week for Jawbone, maker of fitness trackers, speakers and Bluetooth headsets. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that the company yesterday laid off around 60 employees, or 15% of staff. It’s a global round of layoffs affecting all areas of the business; and as part of it Jawbone is also closing down its New York office (which was concentrated on marketing) and downsizing satellite operations in Sunnyvale and Pittsburgh. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson said the layoffs are part of a wider “streamlining.” From what we understand, there are no specific product areas being cut as part of this restructuring. The company, in other words, will continue to sell its Jambox speakers and the Era headset, along with related accessories. More generally, however, Jawbone has been increasingly focusing is R&D, product and marketing attention on its range of UP fitness trackers.Successful Tech IPO#1: Shares of Square Soar by 45% After Public Offering: Square began trading as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, at one point surging more than 64 percent above its initial public offering price of $9. It ended the day up 45 percent, closing at $13.07. The first-day pop followed a turbulent I.P.O. process for the six-year-old company, one that was marred by questions over pricing and valuation and that arrived in the face of a precarious public market for technology offerings. On Wednesday, when Square had priced its shares at $9, that was lower than the $11 to $13 range it had set, putting its valuation at $2.9 billion, well below the $6 billion price tag that private investors had valued the company at last year. As recently as Wednesday, advisers laid out options for Square including pulling the deal, three people briefed on the discussions said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, but for Square, that was not a consideration.  “We have a great beginning,” said Jack Dorsey, Square’s chief, striking an upbeat note in an interview on Thursday, which was his 39th birthday. “I don’t see negativity as necessarily something that detracts from our work.” The I.P.O. ordeal illustrates the difficulties — some might say guesswork — of accurately valuing companies, both when they are private and when they go public. And Square, which closed its first day trading with a market capitalization of $4.4 billion, now faces the challenge of moving on from the fund-raising event, solidifying its business and building itself up. “I want to get back to a steady state and back to business,” Mr. Dorsey said. He added that Square’s strategy now was “to continue to save people trips to the bank. We’re not going out there to say we’re getting rid of the banks or card networks. We’ve just put a much cleaner face on that infrastructure.”Sucessful Tech IPO#2: Investors 'swipe right' in Tinder-owner Match's debut: Shares of media mogul Barry Diller's Match Group, the owner of popular dating site Match.com and mobile app Tinder, jumped as much as 24 percent in their market debut on Thursday, valuing the company at $3.57 billion. Match Group, which touts itself as the world's No. 1 dating company, is seen as the crown jewel of Diller's media properties and has driven parent IAC/InterActiveCorp's (IACI.O) profit and revenue in recent quarters. The U.S. online romance market, worth more than $2 billion a year, has thrived as instant messaging, photo-sharing and geolocation services grow in popularity. One of Match Group's most popular offerings is Tinder, a mobile app on which people \"swipe right\" or \"swipe left\" to signal their willingness – or not – to meet prospective partners.Patron of Indian start-ups Tiger Global to tone down current aggressive style; to come up with two-track approach in giving money to companies: Tiger Global Management, the most prolific backer of startups in India, has decided to tone down its current aggressive style here, several people aware of the thinking at the US firm said, in a reflection of the limits of its strategy so far as well as the changing investor mood. Tiger, which is based in New York with private investments led by Lee Fixel, is coming up with a twotrack approach when it comes to giving money to companies in its portfolio, conversations with founders and investors reveal. The ones that are in leadership positions in the market can expect Fixel to keep his purse strings open, but not the laggards which have been told to fend for themselves. They must obtain validation from investors other than Tiger to lead new rounds and get unit economics right with positive operating margins. One of the founders who met Fixel recounted the conversation thus: \"I will be leading very few investments in the next six to eight months, but if you use your cash and survive this cycle, then the pressure will ease out.\" Tiger, which is the main backer of India's most valuable startup Flipkart and owns significant stakes in the country's largest cab aggregator Ola, has invested around $2 billion (Rs 13,000 crore) in over 35 Indian companies. This year it has been even more active than in the past, but that has changed along with the onset of a more cautious mood about throwing large sums of money at consumer internet ventures. Square prices shares at 52% discount to last valuation in disappointing turn to long-awaited IPO: sources: Mobile payments company Square Inc priced shares at $9 late on Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter, further discounting the company's valuation before it begins trading Thursday morning. Square has raised $243.5 million in its Wall Street debut, about $80 million less than expected. The price set on Wednesday puts Square's market capitalization at $2.9 billion, a 52 percent drop from the $6 billion valuation it had earned at its last private funding round. San Francisco-based Square, led by CEO Jack Dorsey, earlier this month set a price range of $11 to $13, well below the $15.46 per-share price of its most recent private financing. The steeper discount to $9 - a 42 percent drop from what investors were willing to pay a year ago - suggests widespread uncertainty about the profitability of the payments industry and the future of Square itself, which has seen slowing revenue growth. \"The way that Square was valued as a private company is they were just going to disrupt everything and change payments,\" said Andrew Chanin, CEO of PureFunds, an exchange-traded fund for mobile payments companies. \"And the reality is not that.\" Compounding concerns is Dorsey's dual role running Twitter Inc., a social media company struggling for a turnaround. Founded in 2009, the company started as a way for small businesses to accept credit card payments through mobile devices. It has evolved to a suite of small business services, relying on partnerships with companies such as Apple and Visa. The valuation cut triggered a ratchet, or protection investors wrote into previous funding rounds, that requires Square to sell several million additional shares. Square will begin trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"SQ\". Square is one of the most prominent \"unicorns,\" or private companies valued at $1 billion or more, to plan a public debut this year. Many have held up Square as an example of how fleeting - and at times nonsensical - private market valuations can be. There are more than 140 \"unicorns\" globally.Match Prices Its IPO at Bottom of Proposed Range as Tinder CEO Breaks Quiet Period Rule with a Bizarre Interview (\"Models Beg Me For Sex\") Match has priced its IPO at $12 per share, raising $400 million . The company will begin trading on the Nasdaq tomorrow, under the ticker symbol ‘MTCH.’ The $12 per share is at the bottom of the anticipated $12 to $14 proposed price range and gives the company a market cap of roughly $2.9 billion. Square, which is also going public tomorrow, just priced its IPO at $9, below the $11 to $13 price range. Match owns a group of dating companies, including OkCupid and the infamous Tinder. That particular subsidiary came under fire today after its leader gave a bizarre interview that may have broken SEC-mandated “quiet period” rules. Tinder CEO Sean Rad: Models Beg Me for Sex:, Dick Pics Aren’t Cool: Tinder’s parent company, the IAC-owned Match Group, is going public tomorrow. As the most attractive and valuable part of the company, it makes sense that Tinder’s CEO, Sean Rad, is talking to media outlets to drum up excitement for the IPO. This morning, a fresh Tinder PR disaster dropped in the form of an interview with journalist Charlotte Edwardes in the London Evening Standard. In it, Rad talks about the number of women he’s slept with (“Is 20 low?”), confuses the word sapiosexual for sodomy and condemns fame-hungry journalists. It makes sense that Rad would say some really, really stupid things in an interview. Rad was the dude who mishandled a sexual misconduct scandal (and the resulting lawsuit) that led to the exit of co-founder and CMO Justin Mateen last year. Rad stepped down as CEO last November, but got a second chance at the top job after his successor, former Microsoft exec Chris Payne, was canned in the wake of a memorable Twitter meltdown. The interview is very long and there are many different great parts. Below is perhaps the best selection from it (here’s another one: “I do not condone penis pictures — that is just not who I am”). I’m sure it will inspire a lot of confidence in investors looking to buy Match Group stock tomorrow: He’s desperate to impress on me how gallant he is, citing the fact that a “supermodel, someone really, really famous” has been “begging” him for sex “and I’ve been like, no.” She’s “taunted” him, he says, and “called me a prude.” “She’s one of the most beautiful women I’ve ever seen but it doesn’t mean that I want to rip her clothes off and have sex with her. Attraction is nuanced. I’ve been attracted to women who are …” he pauses “… well, who my friends might think are ugly. I don’t care if someone is a model. Really. It sounds clichéd and almost totally unbelievable for a guy to say this, but it’s true. I need an intellectual challenge.” He continues: “Apparently there’s a term for someone who gets turned on by intellectual stuff. You know, just talking. What’s the word?” His face creases with the effort of trying to remember. “I want to say ‘sodomy’?”Goldman Says to Buy Apple Because It's Becoming a Services Company: It's time to stop thinking of Apple as a hardware company and start thinking of it as a service company. At least, that's what Goldman Analyst Simona Jankowski and her team are telling clients as they add the stock to their \"conviction buy\" list and call for a price of $163 in the next 12 months.  \"We expect that over the next year, the focus will shift from unit growth (which is slowing given a maturing smartphone market) to installed base monetization and recurring revenues (“Apple-as-a-Service”). Apple’s model has already tilted that way with its new iPhone 6s installment plans, and we see the upcoming TV service as a powerful next step.\" Due to Apple's large and loyal customer base, the team argues that there is a \"significant multi-year opportunity\" for the tech giant to boost monetization. Jankowski's team estimates that over 90 percent of those purchasing iPhones are repeat customers, which will make it much easier for Apple to become a service-like company, especially as it launches a TV service. The timing might prove perfect for a foray into the TV space as well, with Goldman pointing towards acceleration in cord cutting as millennials are more apt to use what it refers to as \"over-the-top media consumption,\" and the skinny bundles such as Sling TV and Vue become more common. \"Theoretically, Apple could transition other products to installment plans as well, and charge customers a monthly bill that also includes its other services such as Apple TV and Music. We think a potential live TV service from Apple would be a key enabler of this transition to an “Apple-as-a-Service” business model.\" The shift to a service model could prove to dramatically increase Apple's average revenue per user (ARPU). Jankowski estimates that Apple's current ARPU would be $42 operating with a service business model.As Lyft Seeks $500M in New Funding, Leaked Lyft Financials Show the Struggles of Being No. 2 Behind Uber: In the first half of the year, the ride-sharing company generated less revenue, lost more money, and added fewer customers than projected in February. Ride-sharing pioneer Lyft is heading back to the fundraising till, but its numbers may not look that rosy to investors. The company lost $127 million in the first half of 2015 on $46.7 million in revenue, according to private fundraising documents obtained by Bloomberg. Lyft, the second-biggest U.S. ride-hailing service, is raising roughly $500 million as the company burns through tens of millions of dollars a month, according to a fundraising presentation compiled by Credit Suisse. It highlights tepid financial performance at Lyft and reveals that the company has repeatedly underperformed its own expectations. In the first half of the year, Lyft generated less revenue, lost more money, and added fewer customers than projected in February. The numbers suggest Lyft has had to burn through cash as it chases growth in a competitive industry. The willingness to spend big on growth is a costly strategy that’s becoming increasingly common in Silicon Valley. Public market investors have expressed concern about the high valuations of private technology companies recently. Fidelity Investments, BlackRock, and others wrote down their stakes in some startups this year.In the first half of 2015, Lyft spent $96.1 million on marketing. That’s more than twice Lyft’s net revenue during the same period. In one document, Lyft promotes its ability to attract new drivers and riders, even as it does so at a sizable loss. Customer discounts represent a big portion of Lyft’s marketing costs. This year, Lyft has also purchased billboards in New York’s Times Square and on Market Street in San Francisco, in addition to paying drivers big bonuses.Earnest, Fueled by Growth in Student Loans, Raises $275 Million: At the start of this year, Earnest was an intriguing but small entrant in an emerging field of start-ups using new tools of data and software to analyze credit risk and make consumer loans. Its loans were typically a few thousand dollars for things like relocation expenses and professional training. But today, the lender, based in San Francisco, is growing at a torrid pace, and on Tuesday it announced a $275 million round of debt and equity to fund further expansion. Already this year, Earnest has made 50 times as many loans as last year, and it is lending from $2 million to $5 million every day, said Louis Beryl, a co-founder and chief executive. In this round, $75 million is equity investment, and $200 million is debt funding. The debt portion is led by New York Life. The new financing brings the total raised by Earnest, founded in 2013, to $325 million. Earnest now employees 165 people, up from 30 at the start of this year. Mr. Beryl says he plans to hire about 200 more employees over the next year, especially technical people like software engineers, data scientists and user-experience designers. The long-term goal, he said, is to “build a platform for the next generation of consumer financial services.” The financial service that has carried Earnest so far is refinancing student loans, which it began at the end of January. It is by far the largest part of the company’s business, and Earnest’s success points to the opportunity in services to ease the burden on the nation’s debt-laden students and recent graduates. Student loan debt is more than $1.2 trillion, growing by about 10 percent a year. Student loans are held by 40 million Americans. Earnest is focusing on the more indebted recent graduates. The size of its average refinancing loan is $70,000. The start-up says the average saving, on its refinanced loans, is $18,000, typically over 10 years. Other online lenders, like SoFi and CommonBond, have also done well in the market for refinancing student loans. But Earnest says its approach is particularly data-intensive, which it says allows it to tailor rates to individual circumstances. It asks its customers for digital links to their bank, credit card and retirement and investment accounts, and information on all their loans. “They are willing to share their data for a better consumer finance experience,” Mr. Beryl said. Earnest says it has read-only access to the information. It pledges not to store personal data or sell it. Earnest has made individual loans of more than $250,000. Traditional credit scoring, Mr. Beryl said, tends to punish high student debt loads. But such Earnest borrowers, he said, are in fields like brain surgery and dental surgery, where education is lengthy and costly. “These are people with great jobs, great educations and great earning potential,” he added. Earnest borrowers average a bit over 30-years-old — young people with slender credit histories and thus charged higher rates by traditional banks. Mr. Beryl said Earnest has had no delinquency problems on its student refinancing loans. And Mr. Beryl, 34, is one of those prompt-paying customers. Having attended Princeton, Harvard Business School and Harvard‘s Kennedy School of Government, he had $100,000 in student loans at the start of the year. He has paid down some, but still holds student loan debt, he said.Latest Craze for Chinese Parents: Preschool Coding Classes: Wu Pei began teaching her 6-year-old son to code this year, thinking he’d enjoy learning a skill that might boost his future job prospects in an increasingly digitized world. Now, she runs classes in Nanjing, China, and is helping more than 100 parents introduce their children to coding. The 35-year-old former computer programmer with Foxconn Technology Group is tapping growing demand from parents intent on preparing their preschoolers for a world in which Oxford University researchers predict half the jobs in some countries may be eliminated by robots and computers. Similar classes are taking off across China. Reynold Ren has taught about 150 primary school-age children in Beijing to use Scratch, a project developed by the MIT Media Lab and Arduino, which enables users to create interactive objects such as robots. In Hong Kong, about 2,500 students have taken courses that Michelle Sun runs at her First Code Academy. “Teaching the next generation coding is something that should be elevated to a strategical national importance,” said Wang Jiulin, the Xi’an-based creator of Kidscode.cn, a website that shares free information and courses. “Even today, the majority of programmers in China can only perform very basic-level tasks and there’s huge demand for top notch coders.”  Lyft executive says on track to hit $1 billion in gross revenue: Ride-hailing app Lyft, Uber's biggest competition in the United States, expects to reach $1 billion in gross annual revenue, the company's co-founder told Reuters. Hitting a $1 billion run rate suggests privately owned Lyft has increased market share in some U.S. cities, despite competition from Uber, a larger and better-financed ride-hailing app. Lyft's net revenue was estimated at $130 million in 2014, according to company financial documents cited by Bloomberg. By comparison, Uber's gross bookings are projected to rise to $10.84 billion this year and $26.12 billion the next, according to a presentation for potential investors seen by Reuters earlier this year. Based on those figures, Uber's 2015 net revenue would be $2 billion. Lyft, founded in 2012, calculated its $1 billion run rate from its gross bookings in October, when the company made about $83 million off of 7 million rides. That did not include Halloween, Zimmer said, which will be counted in November's figures and is one of the ride-hailing industry's busiest nights of the year. Lyft has more than a 40 percent market share in San Francisco, its hometown, and in Austin, Texas, Zimmer said. The majority of rides in San Francisco and New York City are through the Lyft Line service, a carpool feature that brings several passengers together to share a car, Lyft co-counder and Chief Executive Logan Green said last week. However, Lyft's continued growth also hinges on its ability to tap investors for money. A recent pullback in late- and mid-stage investing and the cooling IPO market are expected to make capital tougher to raise for high-priced companies.Microsoft sheds reputation as easy mark for hackers:  Microsoft was once the epitome of everything wrong with security in technology. Its products were so infested with vulnerabilities that the company’s co-founder, Bill Gates, once ordered all of Microsoft engineers to stop writing new code for a month and focus on fixing the bugs in software they had already built. But in recent years, Microsoft has cleaned up its act, even impressing security specialists like Mikko Hypponen, the chief research officer for F-Secure, a Finnish security company, who used to cringe at Microsoft’s practices. “They’ve changed themselves from worst in class to the best in class,” Mr. Hypponen said. “The change is complete. They started taking security very seriously.” Microsoft estimates that it now spends more than $1 billion a year on security-related initiatives, including acquisitions. It acquired three security start-ups in the last year alone, and the number of security employees at the company increased 20 percent during that time. Soon after he became Microsoft’s chief executive in February 2014, Mr. Nadella instituted a monthly meeting with security leaders from across the company. They meet to discuss industry trends and analyze threats. He also altered how Microsoft watched the Internet for hacker attacks, an effort that had been splintered among different product groups and other divisions within the company. Microsoft now pays hackers more when they find and turn over a security hole.Chip-Only, or Chip-And-Pin? Credit Cards Give Retailers Another Grievance Against Banks: The employee perched on a stepstool by the checkout at Trader Joe’s in Union Square in Manhattan is like an air traffic controller: Register 6 for one customer. Register 9 for the next. The routine helps move traffic quickly through the store, where the lines can often snake around the aisles of whole grain cereal, mixed nuts and Fair Trade coffee. Trader Joe’s, like many retailers around the country, recently upgraded its payment terminals around the Oct. 1 deadline to accept debit and credit cards with a new security chip. The timing, retailers say, could not be worse. The new terminals are often slower, meaning that the long lines during the busy year-end holiday season will grow longer. The new chip cards are also at the center of a growing dispute that has pitted two of America’s most prominent industries — banking and retailing — against each other, and pulled in attorneys general and even the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the process. But the debate involves more than whether consumers will be adequately protected during a season that has been rife with security breaches: The battle could affect the long-simmering war over the billions of dollars in interchange fees that merchants pay to process credit and debit transactions. “That is the crux of the matter,” said David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a payments industry publication. “The real savings is not about fraud, the real savings is about interchange.” Last year, merchants paid about $61 billion in interchange fees, Mr. Robertson said, compared with about $30 billion in fraud losses. The fight involves new payment cards, issued over the last year, that come with a small square security chip that can help make in-person transactions more secure. Retailers complain that they have spent billions of dollars upgrading their payment terminals to accommodate a system that cuts down only on the fraud shouldered by banks, not merchants. Chip and PIN, long the standard in Europe, would help retailers verify not just the card, but the person using it. Writing to their colleagues in October, two attorneys general sounded a warning bell: The new security chip would not go far enough to make transactions safer. Credit cards needed a PIN, too. “If we continue to settle for weaker standards here, we will continue to pay the price,” wrote Sam Olens, the Republican Georgia attorney general, and George Jepsen, his Democratic counterpart in Connecticut. They urged top prosecutors in other states to sign a separate letter to Visa, MasterCard, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and other institutions, pushing them to adopt the chip-and-PIN technology. Banking groups were swift to issue their own statement, saying that merchants had been “spreading an outdated narrative.” In November, a spokesman for Mr. Olens confirmed that he had taken his name off the letter.Pandora To Buy Music Streaming Provider Rdio Assets For $75M In Cash, Rdio Files Ch.11, Will Shutter Service: That was fast: just as soon as it was reported that Pandora was in talks to buy Rdio, the two sides have confirmed that an acquisition is indeed taking place. Pandora has acquired “key assets” from Rdio for $75 million in cash, the company has just announced. But as part of it, the Rdio service as we know it is tanking: the streaming service is filing for bankruptcy. “The transaction is contingent upon Rdio seeking protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. Upon approval of the proposed transaction by the bankruptcy court, Rdio will be winding down the Rdio-branded service in all markets,” Pandora noted in its statement. Separately, Rdio said in a blog post that it will shut down in the coming weeks. More immediately, however, Rdio will continue uninterrupted. In digital music market with constrained economics, we are likely to see yet more consolidation or outright closures. And with Rdio, there is still a chance that someone could step in right now and buy the company instead of Pandora, Rdio noted in its own statement: “While we are filing for bankruptcy, because the planned sale to Pandora is contingent on such a filing, by law Rdio is required to entertain competitive offers during the bankruptcy process that is being managed for us by Moelis & Company,” it noted. But, if Pandora’s pland does go ahead, it sounds like Pandora’s plan will be to create its own flavor of on-demand streaming to exist alongside its radio-style service. The assets it is planning to buy include technology and intellectual property. Additionally it’s taking on several members of Rdio’s team, but that will not include Anthony Bay, who is staying on with Rdio to wind down the business, Brian McAndrews confirmed on a conference call about the news today.For Indian tech startups, 'Winter is here… and why this is a great time to invest':  The horizontal e-commerce Unicorns in India – Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon, and adding ShopClues and even a more diversified Paytm – are in a dogfight with no end in sight. It doesn’t help that Amazon keeps on growing from strength to strength and getting more aggressive. The online classified players have even bigger issues. Unlike the e-commerce Unicorns, Quikr, OLX, the real estate and car classified firms and other listing-related ones like Zomato have yet to see a serious revenue jump that matches their astounding valuation surge. They all have a serious dogfight coming with no one being particularly dominant in their segment (well Zomato is, but is revenue growth justifying valuation?). Ola and Uber? Ditto, serious dogfight with no end in sight. Ad-tech? Tough for InMobi and Pubmatic to claim resilience and justify high valuations when Facebook and Google want to eat it all. Payments? Paytm has an extraordinary franchise but is it too distracted with other possibilities? Probably the only secure privately-held Unicorn in India is MuSigma – no surprise there as it has real profits and real cash generation. All the rest of the Unicorns are work in process. For early-stage startups, good news and very bad news. The good news is that several Series A funds have lots of dry powder – Accel, Kalaari, Matrix, Nexus, SAIF, Sequoia, etc. will all continue to invest and there will be some fantastic opportunities as the extraordinary customer adoption, benefits of a hyper-connected world and improvements in broadband infrastructure will continue. This is a great time to invest, much like 2008-2011 when many Unicorns of today were created. Many investors have seen such down cycles before and they will not retreat. We also plan to continue investing at our regular rate of one to two deals per quarter. However, Series A investors have to be prepared to fund fewer deals and fund the winners more as Series B/C will not be easy to come by as the ‘hedgies’ boosting up this market and valuations are more or less gone. Indian startups are not a good ‘trade’ anymore! The really bad news is that funding will be available to only a small number of players, as investors get overly conservative. There will be mass closures or scale downs and heavy bleeding for many angel, seed and Series A investors. Capital will vanish for not only the vague and fluffy ideas but even for some good ones as they will get washed away with the tide and sink.The War on Campus Sexual Assault Goes Digital: According to a recent study of 27 schools [in the United States], about one-quarter of female undergraduates and students who identified as queer or transgender said they had experienced nonconsensual sex or touching since entering college, but most of the students said they did not report it to school officials or support services. Some felt the incidents weren’t serious enough. Others said they did not think anyone would believe them or they feared negative social consequences. Some felt it would be too emotionally difficult. Now, in an effort to give students additional options — and to provide schools with more concrete data — a nonprofit software start-up in San Francisco called Sexual Health Innovations has developed an online reporting system for campus sexual violence. Students at participating colleges can use its site, called Callisto, to record details of an assault anonymously. The site saves and time-stamps those records. That allows students to decide later whether they want to formally file reports with their schools — identifying themselves by their school-issued email addresses — or download their information and take it directly to the police. The site also offers a matching system in which a user can elect to file a report with the school electronically only if someone else names the same assailant. Callisto’s hypothesis is that some college students — who already socialize, study and shop online — will be more likely initially to document a sexual assault on a third-party site than to report it to school officials on the phone or in person.As Bubble Deflates, A Cottage Industry Emerges Around Startup Investors Trying to Cash Out: With Silicon Valley startups staying private longer these days, investors, company executives and rank-and-file employees are increasingly eager to cash out early. In recent weeks, growing fears of a bubble have given insiders even more incentive to sell their shares. Typically company founders try to limit such transactions, but a cottage industry has sprung up to help facilitate the sales on the quiet. Selling shares early isn’t entirely new. Before Facebook Inc. went public in 2012, a secondary market emerged that helped early employees and investors cash out to buy houses, cars or build a nest egg. A network of brokers helped facilitate the private deals, and firms such as DST Global Ltd., run by Russian billionaire Yuri Milner, were eager to amass positions in the growing social network. Many of the current crop of promising startups -- among them Palintir, Dropbox, Flipboard -- have reached or surpassed their fifth year of existence. That’s when early employees increasingly need the cash, said Mark Dempster, a partner at Founders Circle, which buys officially sanctioned secondary shares. Adding to the anxiousness among those with equity in startups is a drop in valuations for some high-profile companies. Fidelity cut the valuation of Snapchat Inc. by about 25 percent in the third quarter, BlackRock Inc. trimmed the value of storage-company Dropbox Inc. and payments company Square Inc. is seeking an IPO market capitalization that’s significantly lower than its valuation as a privately held company. There’s no shortage of eager buyers attempting to buy a stake in a hot startup. Some aspiring investors even cold call insiders asking to buy shares. organized sales clearly aren’t meeting all the demand to cash out. Many employees and investors are finding other ways to sell shares on their own. Several companies have sprouted up to help find buyers for their shares. EquityZen, based in New York, offers “forward contracts,” where an employee trades the rights to their stock in exchange for cash now. The company sends out regular e-mails offering stock in companies such as Spotify, AppDyanmics and Chartboost. The sellers “get the cash they are looking for,” said Chief Executive Officer Atish Davda said in an interview. More traditional financial institutions also are participating in the secondary market, with mutual funds, hedge funds and asset managers like BlackRock Inc. occasionally buying shares this way. Last month, Nasdaq bought Secondmarket Solutions Inc., the operator of a software platform that helps facilitate the sales of shares in private companies.After Outcry, Ireland Adjusts Its Corporate Tax Draw: While lawmakers often play down its importance, Ireland’s 12.5 percent tax rate (versus 35 percent, before deductions, in the United States) has been a mainstay in the country’s decades-long strategy to attract the world’s largest companies. With few natural and manufacturing resources, Ireland and its politicians instead have turned to one of the world’s lowest corporate tax rates as the country’s primary competitive advantage in the global economy. In recent years, other European countries have accused Ireland of acting like an unfair low-tax haven. The European Commission, for example, is investigating whether Ireland gave Apple a preferential tax deal that broke the region’s tough state-aid rules. While lawmakers and the company have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, the country is already phasing out the most controversial loopholes. Ireland has since turned to a new inducement: a low tax rate on revenue generated from patents and other intellectual property held in Ireland. Such an incentive — announced last month to be 6.25 percent, or half of the country’s corporate tax rate — could be most attractive to patent-heavy industries like technology and pharmaceuticals. But many tax experts say the benefits will be significantly smaller than many had expected, particularly for global tech giants. Because of recent changes to global agreements, Ireland must limit what type of intellectual property can be included in these low-tax structures, known locally as a “knowledge development box.” Such restrictions have been demanded by several European countries, particularly Germany, which raised concerns that Ireland and other countries would turn to such structures to unfairly bring down corporate tax rates. Under international law, Ireland and other countries like Britain and potentially the United States can offer the tax breaks only on intellectual property derived from research carried out in their national borders. Much of the research and development for technology companies is done outside Ireland. So revenue from global patents like those linked to Google’s search algorithm, many of which were developed in the United States, will not be eligible for the reduced tax. Still, for regulators who have tried to limit Ireland’s tax advantage, the restrictions placed on the country’s knowledge development box represent a victory in the global push to close unfair tax loopholes. Some companies in Ireland had lobbied for a wider definition of what type of intellectual property, especially linked to online advertising and search patents moved from other countries to Ireland, could be included in the tax mechanism. Those efforts, though, failed.Sensor and Chip Makers stand to win as automakers battle for high-tech dominance: Automakers hope semi-autonomous features will, over time, help drivers and regulators get over fears of riding in vehicles that accelerate, steer and stop themselves, making potentially life-or-death judgments. Shorter term, car companies want these features to make driving more convenient - and cars more profitable. Ford's Active Speed Limiter comes at 560 euros ($602.78), and it's too soon to tell how popular it will be. Among the biggest winners for now are the companies that produce electronic sensors, cameras and software that make self-driving features possible. The growing list includes the high-tech units of traditional automotive suppliers such as Germany's Continental AG, Israel's Mobileye Vision Technologies, and consumer-technology giants Google, Apple, Samsung Electronics Co, Sony Corp and more. At Silicon Valley's Nvidia Corp, for example, video games remain the biggest market, but automotive revenue is the fastest-growing segment.Uber Signs Digital Mapping Deal With TomTom: Uber, the ride-hailing service, agreed on Thursday to use digital maps provided by the Dutch technology company TomTom in its smartphone applications. The move is the latest foray into digital mapping for Uber, which had offered to buy Nokia’s mapping business for around $3 billion early this year but lost out on the deal to a consortium of German automakers. Uber, which is increasingly using digital maps to run its fast-expanding global operation, has also acquired a portion of Microsoft’s map technology and hired a number of engineers from Microsoft’s mapping team. As part of the latest deal, Uber will license TomTom’s mapping and traffic management services in the more than 300 cities where it operates. Uber did not say how much it would pay for the licensing rights. The agreement represents a lift for TomTom, which also provides the core mapping services used in Apple’s Maps app, as well as in its own mapping products. TomTom has faced stiff competition from the likes of Google Maps and Nokia’s former mapping unit, called Here, which is now owned by Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler. Both of those competitors have greater financial resources to invest in their mapping services, though analysts said the Dutch company could benefit as people who do not want to rely on Google or the German carmakers look for alternatives. That appears to be the case with Uber, which has shown increased interest in developing its own mapping operations despite maintaining close ties to Google. In February, for instance, Uber announced plans to open a research and development center in Pittsburgh, where the company said it would study autonomous cars.Apple is working on a person-to-person payments service that may give iPhone owners another reason to use their Apple Wallets. The company is in talks with banks about the new service, which would let people use their smartphones to send money to one another as easily as they send messages, according to a person with knowledge of the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The service, which could be ready as soon as next year, would compete with PayPal’s peer-to-peer payments app Venmo, and Square’s Square Cash. Apple started Apple Pay, a mobile payments service, in October 2014. This summer it combined payments with Passbook, an app that stored digital tickets and airline boarding passes, as the rebranded product Wallet. Apple has said that it wants a bigger slice of the payments industry. Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said at the company’s annual developer conference in June that Apple’s goal was “replacing the wallet.” Peer-to-peer payment services, which can foster consumer loyalty, are growing. This year, users of Facebook Messenger were offered a payment service akin to one that users of China’s popular messaging app WeChat use to send payments to friends. Google has also experimented with payments in its messaging service. Banks are trying to create peer-to-peer payment products within their own mobile banking apps using a bank-owned digital payments network called clearXchange, which covers about 80 percent of all of the banks. And Square Cash has processed more than $1 billion in money transfers since the peer-to-peer program was introduced about two years ago, according to Square’s recently filed prospectus for its initial public offering. Venmo, the money transfer app owned by PayPal and popular among younger users, processed nearly $2.4 billion in 2014. To date, few of these efforts are direct moneymakers for the companies. Square Cash and Venmo are free to use when linked to a customer’s checking account, and consumers are charged only a small fee when using a credit card. For companies like Apple and Facebook, peer-to-peer payments are a way to involve customers more deeply with their products and to encourage them to leave their wallets at home.After Square and DropBox, possible decline in Snapchat valuation signals trouble for unicorns: The worth of hot technology start-ups seemed for years to go in only one direction: straight up. Now there are signs of growing unease over the dizzying valuations of some of the most richly priced private companies. The latest sign has emerged with one such favorite, Snapchat, being discounted 25 percent by one of its more recent investors, Fidelity, the mutual fund giant. Another start-up, Dropbox, the widely used file storage service, was devalued by the giant asset manager BlackRock this year. The funds’ markdowns may tap the brakes on a fast-growing market. Investors, in the hopes of getting a piece of the next Facebook or Google, have been pouring billions of dollars into young private companies. Yet the public stock market has cooled for new technology companies: witness the current effort by Square, a mobile payments company, to go public at a valuation lower than what its last private investment gave it. The moves by Fidelity and BlackRock reflect how mutual funds can create challenges for technology’s favored start-ups, just as they helped inflate valuations in the first place. Over the last few years, mutual funds fought to buy pieces of appealing venture-backed companies like Snapchat and Dropbox. The idea was that public investors wanted to own these start-ups because their value was growing faster than that of many publicly traded companies. By owning the private shares, the large mutual funds would also get to know the start-ups and be well positioned to buy their shares when they went public. As mutual fund and venture capital investors jockeyed with hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds to invest, their abundant capital pushed prices for private shares into the stratosphere. Snapchat, for example, is valued at more than $16 billion and Dropbox at around $10 billion. The biggest prize of them all, Uber, is now seeking a round of investment that would value the company at $60 billion to $70 billion. Uber’s success with that round would be a further test of investors’ appetite. The competition among investors also helped create a herd of dozens of “unicorns,” a term for private companies valued above $1 billion, coined when such a phenomenon was still considered rare. Yet unlike venture capital firms, mutual funds are legally obligated to value each of their portfolio holdings every day, including hard-to-value assets like shares in private companies, and they must report these values at least every half year. A spokesman for the Investment Company Institute, one of the largest mutual fund associations, said that the process was a “good faith determination” of what an owner could get in a sale of the asset.Match Is Seeking $3.1 Billion Value in I.P.O.: The Match Group is seeking a valuation of about $3.1 billion as it prepares for an initial public offering. The company, which owns the online dating brands OkCupid and Tinder, said on Monday that it planned to sell 33.3 million shares for $12 to $14 apiece. Those terms indicate an offering size of $433 million and a market valuation of $3.1 billion at the midpoint. In setting these terms, Match begins a roadshow, meeting with investors who will help the company set an official I.P.O. price in a few weeks, based on demand. The media conglomerate that owns Match, IAC/InterActiveCorp, whose chairman is Barry Diller, has been acquiring a number of dating sites over the last few years. As the online-dating industry increased in popularity, legacy sites like Match.com started facing more competition from free models like OkCupid. Mr. Diller’s strategy was to build scale by acquiring a portfolio of brands – now 45 in all – and eventually spin them off under the Match umbrella.Google Offers Free Software in Bid to Gain an Edge in Machine Learning: A race is underway toward the future of computer technology with advances in a branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning. Machine-learning software is trained to handle vast amounts of data, and then learns as it goes, often on its own. Machine learning has been around for a long time, and it has been a crucial technology in the success of Internet giants like Google, Amazon and Facebook — used in the development of search, ad targeting and product recommendations. But in the last few years, machine learning has made huge improvements in computer vision, language translation and speech recognition, largely by applying the techniques of deep learning, which is inspired by theories about how the brain recognizes patterns. Every major technology company is investing aggressively in artificial intelligence and machine learning. And not just computer companies. Last Friday, Toyota announced it would spend $1 billion for research and development on artificial intelligence in the United States over the next five years. Google announced on Monday a bold step to establish its leadership in the field of machine learning, accelerate the pace of innovation in the field and potentially strengthen its business. It is making the software of its new machine-learning system, TensorFlow, which was developed over years, open-source code. The software will be freely available for outside programmers to use and modify.Square Takes an IPO Bullet for All of the Overpriced Unicorns: Square announced plans on Friday morning to price its IPO at $11 to $13 a share, meaning an IPO in that range would value the company at much less than the valuation it secured in its last round of private financing. If the company prices at $13, Square would carry a value of about $4.2 billion based on the approximately 323 million shares it says will be outstanding. Square, Jack Dorsey’s payments company, was valued by private investors at about $6 billion in its last round of private financing, according to insiders. To be sure, Square’s bankers could increase the price range before the IPO if they get feedback from investors that demand is higher than expected. But the range would have to jump a fair bit to even match what Square thought it was worth in its last round of funding.Verizon Says Time Is Right for Kids to Get Smartwatches: While smartwatches have yet to really become a hit for adults, LG and Verizon say the time is right to strap them onto little kids. Verizon has started selling two new GPS-connected wearables that allow parents and kids to stay in contact and also to alert parents when their children leave a predefined area.The $125 GizmoGadget aims to mimic the look of adult smartwatches and has a touchscreen interface, apps and a choice of different themes and watch faces. It also features a pedometer and the ability for kids and parents to exchange text messages with emojis, voice clips or preset messages. GizmoGadget allows kids to call one of nine preset phone numbers. The more basic GizmoPal 2, which sells for $55, has LED lights to alert kids when a caregiver is calling.NYT VR: How to Experience a New Form of Storytelling From The Times: Today, The New York Times takes a step into virtual reality. NYT VR is a mobile app that can be used — along with your headphones and optionally a cardboard viewing device — to simulate richly immersive scenes from across the globe. To start, The Times Magazine presents three portraits of children driven from their homes by war and persecution — an 11-year-old boy from eastern Ukraine named Oleg, a 12-year-old Syrian girl named Hana and a 9-year-old South Sudanese boy named Chuol. “This new filmmaking technology enables an uncanny feeling of connection with people whose lives are far from our own,” writes Jake Silverstein, editor of the magazine.Indian startups cut jobs as funding slows down: “I don’t know what is going to happen now,” said Ankit Agarwal (name changed), a TinyOwl sales person who was sacked last week. His words summarise the predicament of around 1,700 persons who lost jobs in the Indian startups in the last three months. “We got a mail on Tuesday saying there will be a meeting to discuss future plans. We first thought it had something to do with our half-yearly appraisals,” Ankit explained how he and 24 others at TinyOwl’s Pune office lost jobs. He did not want to reveal his real name, fearing it would affect his future job prospects. After much publicised 36-hour drama involving gherao of a co-founder, police intervention and local politicians’ entry into the startup’s premises, the sacked employees managed to get their full and final settlement that 15 of their colleagues who were fired in the previous month have not got yet. However, all of them will have an uncertain Diwali since their frantic job searches are met with stoic ‘we-will-get-back-to-you’ responses. The actual number of job cuts could be even higher than the estimated 1700 lay-offs across well-known internet startups such as Housing, Zomato, TinyOwl and LocalBanya, as many such cases go unreported. Firings and shutdowns happen rather routinely among many 50-100 employee startups.Why Health Care Start-Ups Like Theranos Need Investing Expertise: The Silicon Valley start-ups that often grab headlines are typically in the Internet and consumer technology world. But there’s another part of start-up land that is also highly active: health-related technology, which includes biotech, health care services and medical devices. Venture capitalists have been pouring money into health-related start-ups, with funding jumping 34 percent to $9.4 billion in 2014 from a year earlier, according to the National Venture Capital Association. What’s often left unsaid about these companies is that they behave very differently from the typical consumer start-up or business software company. The health-related start-up sector has produced fewer unicorns, which are the private companies with $1 billion-plus valuations, largely because it takes a long time to develop new medical tests, drugs or insurance systems. Regulators often weigh in. Even if an idea behind a start-up is truly great, it’s bound to fail if the science doesn’t work out, if the regulators don’t like what they see, or if insurers and the government won’t pay for the product.People doing ‘crazy things’ with Tesla’s autopilot are spoiling it for everybody: Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is warning that some new limits may be coming to the company's autopilot feature because of \"some fairly crazy videos on YouTube\" showing drivers behaving dangerously while the car is in control. Tesla doesn't recommend taking your hands off the wheel while the car is in autopilot mode. Yet that's exactly what some people are doing, leading to things like near-misses with other vehicles:Even the New York Times' video review made a big deal out of being able to drive hands-free. \"This is not good,\" Musk said on an earnings call this week. \"We'll put on some constraints on autopilot to minimize people doing crazy things with it.\" Musk didn't elaborate on what kinds of new restrictions autopilot users could soon face, though it's likely that they would show up in the form of another software update.In a first, the FCC is fining a major cable company for getting hacked: In the first such case against a U.S. cable company, federal regulators are slapping Cox Communications with a $595,000 fine after Cox allowed hackers from Lizard Squad to penetrate its systems and steal private customer information. By posing as an IT administrator and tricking a couple of Cox employees into giving up their login credentials, a hacker known as \"EvilJordie\" broke into Cox's databases and gained access to customer names, addresses, password recovery information and even \"partial\" Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers, according to the Federal Communications Commission. They also got hold of some customers' telephone records. As many as 61 current or former Cox customers were affected by the breach, which occurred between Aug. 7 and Aug. 14 of 2014. The hackers changed 28 of these customers' passwords, locking them out of their own accounts, and posted eight people's personal information on social media.Add a Fund to Amazon Cart? You Have Indian Regulator's Support: Indians are estimated to spend about $9 billion this year shopping online for everything from smartphones to cupcakes. The nation’s stock market regulator wants them to add another product to their shopping cart: mutual funds. The Securities & Exchange Board of India plans to change its regulations to allow online marketplaces such as Flipkart Online Services Pvt. and Amazon.com Inc. to offer funds alongside other products, Chairman U.K. Sinha said in an interview at his office in Mumbai. Mutual funds have gained popularity among Indian savers, receiving more money in the past 17 months than they did in the preceding 12 years. Yet just 3 percent of the nation’s 1.2 billion people invest in them, with majority preferring bank deposits or gold, according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India. Allowing e-commerce sites to sell funds will help money managers reach out to young investors accustomed to shopping online, providing the industry with a new distribution channel, Sinha said.In India, Tiny Owl Founder Reportedly Detained for Two Days By Laid-Off Employees — and the Police: Well that was strange — and scary. Hours ago, one of six cofounders of Tiny Owl, a two-year-old, Mumbai, India-based food ordering software startup, was released after being held captive for two days by disgruntled former employees at the company’s office in Pune. Tiny Owl had earlier this week announced $7.67 million in fresh funding from earlier backers Matrix Partners and Sequoia Capital. But the funding came with the understanding that Tiny Owl would follow through on a major restructuring to control its burn rate.As part of that restructuring plan, the company is shutting down its operations in four cities, including Pune. Which leads us to what happened to company cofounder Gaurav Choudhary. Choudhary had traveled to Pune earlier this week to oversee the office’s closure, while his fellow cofounders – all of whom are graduates of IIT Bombay — traveled to sites in Gurgaon, Chennai and Hyderabad to do the same. But according to various media accounts, soon after Choudhary informed Tiny Owl’s Pune-based employees of the layoffs, he was asked to pay them immediately. When he said he couldn’t, they reportedly refused to let him leave the building and return to Mumbai.Airbnb and Uber Mobilize Vast User Base to Sway Policy: Over the last few years, so-called sharing companies like Airbnb and Uber — online platforms that allow strangers to pay one another for a room or a ride — have established footholds in thousands of communities well before local regulators have figured out how to deal with them. Now, as cities grapple with the growth of these services and try to pass rules for how they should operate, the companies are fighting back by turning their users into a vast political operation that can be mobilized at any sign of a threat. Airbnb offered the latest and most vociferous example of this on Wednesday. Fresh off defeating a San Francisco measure that would have severely curtailed the company’s business in its hometown, Airbnb staged a news conference that functioned as a warning shot to other cities thinking about proposing new regulations. The event was billed as a debriefing to discuss the defeat of Proposition F, which would have toughened existing rules for the service by, among other things, cutting the number of nights people could rent out rooms in their homes. In this city of about 840,000 people, roughly $8 million was raised by groups opposed to Proposition F — about eight times the amount raised by the proposition’s backers, according to records filed with the San Francisco Ethics Commission. Airbnb is preparing for more fights. Mr. Lehane said the company was working to organize voting blocs in other cities where it operates. By the end of next year, he said, the company has a goal of creating 100 “clubs” made up of Airbnb home-sharers — sort of like local unions. Companies like Airbnb and Uber have become multibillion-dollar companies by employing a kind of guerrilla growth strategy in which they set up a modest team of workers in a city and immediately start providing their services to the public, whether local laws allow them to or not.Jet.com to Raise Funds Valuing the Amazon Rival at $1.5 Billion: Jet.com, the much-hyped Amazon.com competitor, is close to raising $500 million to $550 million in a funding round led by Fidelity Investments, according to a person familiar with the plans. The investment would give the year-old online shopping startup a valuation of at least $1.5 billion, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the deal isn't finalized. Founded by a former Amazon executive, Jet is aggressively trying to undercut its chief rival’s prices and attract customers quickly. To achieve that goal, it had raised $220 million before selling a single product and abandoned its subscription membership fee a few months after opening its doors in July. Jet is attracting a loyal following by offering customers unique ways to save on orders, including discounts for paying with a debit card or waiving their right to return products they buy, said Scot Wingo, chairman of ChannelAdvisor. Customers can also amass savings by loading up their carts with more items, which minimizes the number of shipments.Alibaba, Baidu Turn `Kingmakers' as China Sees Dealmaking Surge: To understand why China is in the midst of a surge in dealmaking and why that won’t slow down anytime soon, consider the arranged marriage of two of the country’s largest travel websites. Qunar Cayman Islands Ltd. and Ctrip.com International Ltd. were bitter rivals for years, bickering in public and sacrificing profits to grab customers in the growing China market. Then Qunar’s largest shareholder, Baidu Inc., forced it into a deal that gave Ctrip control over the combined entity, according to a person familiar with the matter. Qunar’s management learned their fate only two days before the announcement, the person said. China’s Internet market, after a surge in startups and record venture-capital investments, is entering a new phase of consolidation as investors grow weary of money-losing battles for customers and push for profitability. Acquisitions by Chinese companies rose 75 percent this year to $413.2 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, with domestic deals in the Internet industry nearly quadrupling to $55.6 billion.Gmail’s Inbox app will now write (some of) your e-mails for you: Google just gave a little bit of help to anyone tired of typing out the same reply to e-mails over and over again. Now, software will do some of the work for you. An updated version of Inbox, one of Google's mail apps, will \"read\" your e-mails and offer up suggested replies. In a company blog post, Gmail software engineer Bálint Miklós said Tuesday that the feature \"uses machine learning to recognize emails that need responses and to generate the natural language responses on the fly.\" The goal is to have options good enough that a user will send short messages in just two taps. And the suggestions are designed to get better as you use the feature more often, and Inbox learns your personal quirks.Tesla’s autopilot will soon become an ‘in-app purchase,’ Elon Musk says: Tesla owners will soon be able to add autopilot functionality to their vehicles if they weren't able to sign up for it earlier, company chief executive Elon Musk said Tuesday. Drivers will be allowed to unlock Tesla's autopilot with a $3,000 payment, Musk told investors. That's about $500 more than what early adopters paid for autopilot's most powerful capabilities. \"That's something we'll be allowing people to do at some point in the coming months,\" said Musk. \"Sort of like an in-app purchase, I guess.\" All Tesla vehicles already benefit from some autopilot safety features, thanks to a recent software update. Automatic emergency braking, collision avoidance and collision warning have now rolled out across the fleet, Musk said. But only about 40,000 Teslas have autopilot enabled, he added. Those vehicles are collectively logging a million miles of driverless driving a day, giving Tesla valuable usage data. The decision by Tesla to allow \"in-app purchases\" of a sort highlights the company's growing habit of using software to upgrade its vehicles, equipping them with new powers on a rapid update cycle.Uber's China Rival Says Cash Burn Has Slowed With Lower Payouts: Didi Kuaidi, the ride-hailing service competing in China with Uber Technologies Inc., said it has slashed the subsidies it pays out to drivers and riders since the middle of this year, reducing its cash burn as the rising number of orders reduce the need for enticements. The level of financial incentives last month were about a third of the level in June and July, Stephen Zhu, vice president of strategy and head of taxi services at Didi Kuaidi, said in an interview in Beijing on Tuesday. Some of its services like taxi-hailing are close to breaking even, he said. The decline in subsidies comes as the transport ministry released draft guidelines that prohibit Internet ride-booking companies to offer their services below cost in order to gain market share, describing such tactics as disruptive to “normal market order.” The proposed regulations also codify requirements that vehicles used in hailing services must be registered for commercial use and that drivers have to obtain qualifications before being allowed to ferry fares.Dell eyes $10 billion asset sales ahead of EMC merger: Dell Inc is preparing to sell around $10 billion in non-core assets, including software and services, to reduce the heavy debt load it will be taking on to buy EMC Corp (EMC.N), according to people familiar with the matter. Dell, which will assume $49.5 billion of debt once the merger with EMC is completed, has communicated the plan to credit rating agencies in recent days, the people said on Monday. Assets Dell could sell include Quest Software, which helps with information technology (IT) management; SonicWall, an e-mail encryption and data security provider; back-up solutions unit AppAssure; as well as IT services provider Perot Systems, the people said. The divestitures will not include Dell's hardware assets such as servers, which are crucial in its quest to dominate the large enterprise market through its merger with EMC, as well as compete more effectively with the likes of Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), the people added.Google Says Chromebooks and Chrome Operating Systems Aren’t Going Away: Rumors of the demise of the Chrome operating system have not just been exaggerated but are simply untrue, Google said on Monday in a rare public response to an earlier report. A report on Thursday in the Wall Street Journal claimed Google is preparing to merge its Chrome OS, which powers the Web-centric Chromebook laptops, with its mobile OS Android. After the story landed, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google’s SVP who runs both Android and Chrome, pushed back on it, tweeting that the company is “very committed” to the desktop operating system.Meg Whitman Seeks Reinvention for HP as It Prepares for Split: When HP splits in two on Sunday after a year of planning, what is left will bear little resemblance to the engineering-driven company founded more than 75 years ago in a garage not far from Stanford University. On one side will be HP Inc., which will largely consist of personal computers and printers. On the other, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, or HPE, which will sell the computer servers, data storage, networking, software and consulting services that run a modern company. Each company is expected to have annual revenue of about $50 billion and will be among America’s 500 largest public companies. Neither will have the standing as one of the most innovative operations in the world that the old HP enjoyed for decades.Uber Germany retreats to Berlin, Munich: Taxi-hailing service Uber Technologies is making a retreat in Germany to the cities of Berlin and Munich as it grapples with a ban from using unlicensed cab drivers. Uber will for now suspend services in Hamburg, Frankfurt and Duesseldorf, it said in a statement on Friday, citing a difficult regulatory environment. A German court in March banned Uber from running services using unlicensed cab drivers and set stiff fines for any violations of local transport laws by the pioneering online taxi firm. The company in Germany has since limited itself to drivers that hold a passenger transport license, among other legal requirements, through its UberX and UberBlack smartphone apps, but it has run into a shortage of suppliers of ride services.Zomato CEO warns may not meet revenue goal, pulls up sales team: Zomato, the restaurant listing and services company which is valued around $1 billion, might fail to meet its sales target for the current financial year, according to an email co-founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal sent to the staff on Friday. In a long mail that Goyal first sent to the company’s sales team and later forwarded to all employees, he talked about the underperformance of the sales team and how it might result in the company missing its revenue targets. “We are far behind the numbers that we promised our investors for this financial year (year ending March 2016) – our investors have said that so far, we have always delivered what we have promised. We are close to not living up to that for the first time in the last 5 years,” Goyal said in the email. The email came a fortnight after the company sacked about 300 employees globally, or 10 per cent of its total workforce. Zomato has also been facing difficulties in retaining top-level staff as a number of senior executives have left the company after short stints.Alphabet Edges Toward Settling the Android or Chrome Question: For years, Google, now known as Alphabet, has supported two operating systems on two very different tracks: Android and Chrome. But now the company is nodding in the direction of Android. Google is working toward allowing its low-cost Chromebook computing devices to work on the popular Android operating system. The work will take place over the next year, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Google is not indicating it plans to stop development of Chrome OS, but making Android work on Chromebooks opens the door to one of the few products that Chrome OS, the lesser-known operating system, had to itself. Chrome OS should not be confused with Google’s popular Chrome web browser. The first Android operating system for mobile devices was introduced about seven years ago as a direct competitor to Apple’s iOS mobile operating system. Since then, it has become the most widely used operating system in the world. Its development was led by an executive named Andy Rubin, who went on to lead much of the company’s robotics efforts before leaving Google last year. Google introduced Chrome OS about a year later, surprising some who wondered why the company needed two operating systems. Interestingly, its early development was led by Sundar Pichai, who is now the chief executive of the part of Alphabet that is still called Google. Chrome OS has gained a following in academia but very few other places. According to IDC, a market research firm, about 3.9 million Chromebooks were shipped to the American education sector last year. If Google should drop the Chrome OS, it will follow in the footsteps of Microsoft. The latest version of Microsoft’s flagship Windows operating system is meant to run on both PCs and mobile devices. Apple still supports separate operating systems for mobile devices and PCs.Microsoft Sells $13 Billion of Bonds in Month's Busiest Day: Microsoft tapped the bond market for $13 billion Thursday, its biggest sale ever, in the busiest session of the month for high-grade issuers. The seven-part deal eclipsed a mark set just eight months ago by the tech giant as it raises money to repurchase stock and repay existing debt. It sold its longest portion, a 40-year bond, at a yield that was 1.8 percentage points more than comparable government debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company sold $3 billion of 10-year notes at a spread of 0.18 percentage point more than its similar maturity debt in the secondary market on Wednesday. “This is a banner year for tech issuance, so they needed to price wide to get people to take down $13 billion,” CreditSights Inc. analyst Jordan Chalfin said in an interview. “For Microsoft, an extra five-10 basis points doesn’t really matter. Their debt-funded share buybacks are very accretive for equity holders.” Microsoft, one of only three non-financial companies with top AAA credit ratings, said in a filing on Thursday that it will use the proceeds for anything from working capital to stock repurchases and repayment of existing debt.Flipboard's Fanfare Fades as Executives Exit, Sale Talks Stall: Flipboard Inc. debuted in 2010 with the kind of fanfare any startup would envy. The news-reading app piggybacked perfectly on the debut of Apple’s iPad tablet and Steve Jobs’s promise of a new era for digital media. Critics loved Flipboard’s magazine-like layout, created by one of the first software designers of the iPhone, and investors poured money into the company. Almost five years later, Flipboard is struggling to live up to the praise. Several senior executives have departed, including co-founder Evan Doll, and talks to sell the company haven’t reached the finish line, according to people familiar with the plans, who asked not be named discussing private matters. Flipboard’s woes are indicative of a larger malaise gripping startups across the technology landscape as questions emerge about the sustainability of the tech-investment boom. Flipboard is performing well enough -- and, after raising more capital earlier this year, is at no risk of going out of business -- but is no longer a breakaway hit. People are finding media through their Facebook or Twitter feeds, limiting the need for a stand-alone application like Flipboard. Meanwhile, advertising rates -- the company’s main revenue stream-- have been in decline. While Flipboard’s reading app was a showpiece for the iPad five years ago, the company is now working to adjust to a changing digital-news market and live up to its $800 million valuation. Other companies facing similar questions about whether they can make good on early investor expectations -- and lofty private-market valuations -- include online storage service Dropbox Inc., note-taking company Evernote Corp., music-streaming service Deezer SA and blood-testing company Theranos Inc., said Anand Sanwal, chief executive officer of CB Insights, a firm that tracks startup investing. The companies face a challenge in that they could be too expensive for another company to buy, yet may not have the business fundamentals to justify their valuations to public investors through an initial public offering, he said.Verizon says Internet of Things revenue at $500 million year-to-date. Aimed at connecting to the Internet everything from household devices to industrial machines, the business is growing at a \"double-digit\" rate, Mike Lanman, senior vice president of enterprise products at Verizon said at an event in San Francisco. \"A large portion of our revenue comes through connectivity but a significant part of it comes from the application layer already,\" he said in a phone interview after introducing a platform to help customers develop applications in healthcare, agriculture, utilities and connected cars. Last year, Verizon's annual revenue from the business totaled $585 million. The global Internet of Things market is expected to grow to $1.7 trillion in 2020 from $656 billion in 2014, according to market research firm IDC. Examples include Verizon's fleet management tracking application and a partnership with Intel Corp (INTC.O) to provide water management sensors in vineyards, Lanman said. At the event, Verizon also unveiled a chip that Lanman said halves the cost of connecting low data usage devices like dog trackers to high-speed networks. AT&T has also been working on growing its \"Internet of Things\" business and previously launched initiatives such as a cloud-based data-analytics platform for companies and a global SIM card for connected cars. AT&T said last week it added 1.6 million connected devices including 1 million connected cars in the third quarter of 2015.Alphabet, Indonesian companies to expand Web access via balloons: Alphabet, the new holding company for Google, has teamed up with three Indonesian telecommunications companies to expand Internet access in that country using solar-powered balloons. Alphabet officials, including co-founder Sergey Brin, and representatives from Indonesian companies Telkomsel, XL Axiata Tbk PT (EXCL.JK) and Indosat Tbk PT (ISAT.JK) signed an agreement Wednesday to bring so-called Project Loon to the nation of 250 million people. The project sends solar-powered balloons 16,000 feet (5,000 meters) into the air to deliver Internet access through radio frequency signals to antennae connected to buildings on the ground. The balloons use algorithms to find the best winds to carry them along their charted course. Project Loon is part of Alphabet's secretive X division, where the company experiments with far-off technologies dubbed \"moonshots\" such as its self-driving car technology. Alphabet and its partners will deploy hundreds of balloons in 2016 over the country of more than 17,000 islands in an effort to determine where gaps in service lie as part of the tests before full-scale service is launched. The U.S. tech company has already tested the project in Brazil, New Zealand and Australia but with only a single carrier. Project Loon Vice President Mike Cassidy said the Indonesian partnership marks the first time it will send signals from multiple telecommunications companies through a single balloon, and that it will be the service's largest deployment to date and could eventually reach 100 million users. Cassidy said the effort is also a model for how Alphabet will move the product into the commercial market. He said the telecommunications companies will use the trial period to determine pricing and billing while Google works out technical issues.PayPal says makes $1 billion in small-business loans in first two years: PayPal Holdings, the online payment processor, said on Tuesday its small-business lending program has processed $1 billion in loans in the first two years of its launch and more than doubled loan growth in that span. PayPal Working Capital is extending short-term loans totaling more than $100 million per month, or $3 million per day, to a mix of sellers on eBay and standalone small- to medium-sized merchants, the company said at a payments conference in Las Vegas. PayPal separated from eBay earlier this year, and Chief Executive Officer Dan Schulman has stated he is looking to use PayPal's size to offer affordable financial services widely.Even As Oracle and AWS Circle Each Other, Oracle Will Not Build a Giant Cloud System Like AWS: Counter to the expectations of many industry watchers, Oracle, the world’s largest maker of software for businesses, is not planning a global computing system to rival Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, the other big global cloud companies. While it has built out a network of 20 data centers, largely filled with Oracle equipment, it now plans to go after customers by offering faster updates of its core products, new ways of customizing applications and a much younger, retooled sales force. “We’ve made our investments,” Mark Hurd, co-chief executive of Oracle, said in an interview. Compared with A.W.S., he said, “the place we like is one of higher profit margins.” Besides applications, Amazon sells raw computing and data storage, which are generally lower-margin businesses. Oracle is expected Tuesday to announce better security inside its cloud because of changes from its proprietary hardware, but won’t sell access to the machines on their own. Oracle’s better margins, Mr. Hurd said, will come from selling large-scale software that can be customized by its buyers to suit local markets and products. He hopes to lower his sales costs and bring in younger companies with salespeople recruited straight from college and given crash courses in selling Oracle cloud products. In the last four years, he said, the company has hired 1,000 graduates a year. “We train them in products, sales skills and processes,” said Mr. Hurd. “They’re selling within a year, with a much lower cost of sales.” Oracle’s sales force, some 30,000 people globally, is considered among the most aggressive and highly compensated in the tech business. Now, Mr. Hurd said, “we have to do some branding” to entice the kind of smaller companies and start-ups the new sales team is chasing. The ease of modification and the faster sales force illustrate how, while still far apart, Oracle and A.W.S. are becoming more like each other as cloud computing goes mainstream. For its part, a few weeks ago A.W.S. dropped all pretense and made a direct bid for Oracle’s customers. A.W.S. even put up a thinly disguised picture of Oracle founder and executive chairman Larry Ellison.Japan's Carmakers Proceed With Caution on Self-Driving Cars: At this week’s Tokyo Motor Show, Nissan Motor Co. will display a concept car with retractable steering wheel and message-flashing windshield, joining Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. in exhibiting vehicles with autonomous modes for changing lanes and avoiding collisions on highways. But while Tesla deployed its Autopilot system this month and Google aims to have fully self-driving cars on the road by 2020, Japan’s automakers see a wait for such vehicles, with introductions coming only after 2025. The unwillingness to take a software-testing approach -- with beta versions used for trial periods and ongoing updates -- and apply this to car-making divides traditional auto companies and tech-industry challengers, said Tatsuo Yoshida, an auto industry analyst with Barclays Plc. Whereas Tesla beamed Autopilot into Model S sedans with the promise the system would continually learn and improve itself, Japan’s automakers view such an approach as putting features on the road before they’re ready. They’re also wary of exposure to liability if they introduce safety features that fail. Each of Japan’s three biggest automakers have set targets to start deploying the technology around 2020. Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk told reporters this month the company can probably develop a completely self-driving car in about three years, while Google has forecast about a five-year time frame.Rackspace Launches Carina, A Hosted Environment For Running Docker Containers: Rackspace is getting deeper into the container game. The company today announced the beta launch of its Carina container service. Carina gives developers access to a fully managed container environment that offers bare-metal performance and still allows them to use the same native Docker tools they are used to from their local development environments. Right now, the service — which will remain available for free during what the team expects to be a long beta period — focuses on Docker’s tooling, but over time, the idea here is to use the flexibility of Magnum and OpenStack to give developers the ability to use other container orchestration engines like Kubernetes and Mesos, as well. The team believes that the combination of a multi-tenant environment and (near) bare-metal access will allow it to deliver the right mix of a high-performance system and low cost. Otto acknowledged a multi-tenant system may not be the right choice for workloads that are highly security sensitive, but the service also gives users the choice to also run containers on Rackspace’s private cloud service. The service provides users with a set of defaults based on the company’s experience, but users can then tweak these as necessary. Otto believes most users will opt to stay with Docker Swarm as the container orchestration engine, simply because it gives users more control (and in an imperative way) than Kubernetes, which is far more opinionated. Because of the way the company architected the service without using a traditional hypervisor (using libvirt/LXC instead), containers will start significantly faster than on a similar service that uses more traditional virtual machines. Because there are still some advantages to running containers on virtual machines — especially when it comes to security — Rackspace also plans to support virtual machines. It’s no secret that large public cloud vendors like Google, AWS and Microsoft now all offer their own container services. The Rackspace team believes that it has an advantage over them in terms of speed, but also because they don’t abstract away the containers from developers. In addition — and this is no surprise coming from Rackspace — the company believes it can offer a level of service that is significantly higher than its competitors. Rackspace already worked with a number of partners to test the service in a private beta. These include O’Reilly Media, which is using containers to power parts of its online learning tools, as well as the Drupal and WordPress hosting service Pantheon, which has long used containers at the core of its platform.Reuters Exclusive: Wal-Mart seeks to test drones for home delivery, pickup: Wal-Mart applied Monday to U.S. regulators for permission to test drones for home delivery, curbside pickup and checking warehouse inventories, a sign it plans to go head-to-head with Amazon in using drones to fill and deliver online orders. The world's largest retailer by revenue has for several months been conducting indoor tests of small unmanned aircraft systems – the term regulators use for drones - and is now seeking for the first time to test the machines outdoors. It plans to use drones manufactured by China's SZ DJI. In addition to having drones take inventory of trailers outside its warehouses and perform other tasks aimed at making its distribution system more efficient, Wal-Mart is asking the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to research drone use in \"deliveries to customers at Walmart facilities, as well as to consumer homes,\" according to a copy of the application reviewed by Reuters. The move comes as Amazon.com, Google and other companies test drones in the expectation that the FAA will soon establish rules for their widespread commercial use. FAA Deputy Administrator Michael Whitaker said in June that the agency expected to finalize regulations within the next 12 months, faster than previously planned. Commercial drone use is currently illegal, though companies can apply for exemptions.JPMorgan Chase says it is building a rival to Apple Pay: JPMorgan Chase said on Monday it will soon launch its own competitor to Apple Pay that will allow consumers to pay retailers using their smartphones in stores, and it has already won the endorsement of a major group of merchants. The largest U.S. bank is the latest company to try to profit from the prevalence of smartphones, which many financial executives believe will one day be consumers' preferred way to pay for everything from milk and eggs at the supermarket to a rental car at an airport. The companies that figure out how to convince consumers to stop pulling credit cards out of their wallets and start paying with their phones stand to earn vast sums by taking a percentage of the trillions of dollars that consumers spend annually. No clear front-runner has emerged in the business yet. Chase believes its smart phone application, known as Chase Pay, has one key advantage: the caliber of retailers it has brought on board, Gordon Smith, chief executive of the bank's consumer business, told Reuters. Chase has signed a deal with the Merchant Customer Exchange, a group of major retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, (WMT.N) the largest U.S. retailer, and Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) to accept payments through the bank's technology. Retailers included in the Merchant Customer Exchange ring up more than $1 trillion of sales per year and have over 100,000 outlets. Rivals like Apply Pay have struggled to sign up retailers to accept their payments. In June, Reuters interviewed the top 100 U.S. retailers and found that two-thirds said they did not plan to accept Apple Pay this year. Apple Pay's website lists Best Buy in its \"Coming Soon\" section but has no mention of Wal-Mart. Chase signed up the Merchant Customer Exchange mainly by promising to cut retailers' costs, Smith said. Whenever a consumer pays for something with plastic, the retailer pays fees to banks and credit card networks to process the transaction. Chase is willing to accept a lower fee for Chase Pay transactions than for other transactions, and hopes to make up the difference by getting more volume over its network, Smith said.Google's first earnings amid a change of guard led to this headline: The New Google: ‘All the Assholes Have Left’Rumor: Uber Refueling Its Warchest Yet Again, At A Valuation Of Up To $70B: Another month, another billion for Uber… The ride-hailing business is reportedly raising yet again — planning to raise close to $1 billion in new investment according to the NYT citing “people close to the matter”, with investors looking at a valuation of between $60 billion and $70 billion for the six-year-old startup. If the NYT’s report is on the money, it comes mere months after the WSJ reported Uber had raised almost $1 billion in new financing, with a valuation then, in July, of more than $50 billion.Microsoft Goes Upscale With Fifth Avenue Flagship Store: Most of the luxury brands on the storefronts of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, one of the world’s most famous shopping thoroughfares, seem to belong together, like the notes of a song. There are Tiffany & Company, Gucci, Armani, Valentino, Rolex and — cue the sound of a record needle sliding off vinyl — Microsoft? Yes, the company that brought us Windows and Office is opening a store on the street that brought us $5,000 handbags and $20,000 watches. The doors of the striking new flagship Microsoft Store will open to the public on Monday. It’s an expensive gamble on a retail strategy that is still a long way from paying off. It does not take a detective to see that the foot traffic is often light at the Microsoft stores the company has opened — the Fifth Avenue store will be its 113th — over the last six years. That’s a contrast with the jamborees usually found over at Apple’s stores, inevitably a few blocks away or across the mall from Microsoft’s electronics boutiques. I got a preview tour of the store last week. It’s clear the building renovation cost a fortune, though Microsoft executives wouldn’t say how much. The company gutted a building from the 1930s that was previously a Fendi store, replacing all but the top of its facade with huge sheets of glass. Walking into the store, what hits you first are the Microsoft devices arrayed on large open tables in the middle of the room. There is a collection of Surface Books, the company’s first laptop, which has received positive reviews and goes on sale Monday. Nearby is the Surface Pro 4, the latest version of the company’s popular tablet computer. An Xbox set up in the front corner of the store — an area Microsoft calls the living room — lets people play Halo 5: Guardians, the science-fiction shooter game that goes on sale Tuesday. Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, is showing more patience with the company’s stores than he has with other unfulfilled initiatives begun under his predecessor, Steven A. Ballmer. Mr. Nadella shut down a Microsoft group that made television shows for people with Xboxes, and he cut the staff working on Microsoft’s phone hardware to a fraction of its former size. Why do Microsoft Stores survive? The bricks-and-mortar alternatives for showing new Microsoft products in their best light are not great. The number of electronics stores has dwindled, leaving just one giant in the United States, Best Buy. And while the stores of wireless carriers are good for putting smartphones in front of the public, category-bending tablets and laptops often require explanations from more-trained specialists.Hackers Demand Ransom From TalkTalk, British Telecom Firm ...BAE Hired to Investigate: The chief executive of TalkTalk, a British telecommunications provider, said on Friday that she had received a ransom demand from hackers who had claimed responsibility for stealing data on some of the company’s four million customers. TalkTalk, which offers cable and fixed-line services in Britain, said local authorities had opened a criminal investigation into the widespread data breach. The hackers may have gained access to personal data on the company’s customers, including sensitive information like credit card details, dates of birth and addresses. TalkTalk’s shares fell as much as 11 percent in morning trading in London, but recovered by the afternoon and were down 2.3 percent in midafternoon trading. Despite the claims of responsibility, it remained unclear whether the group that had contacted TalkTalk was behind the breach or whether the ransom demands were credible. Yet TalkTalk’s data breach — the third successful attack on the company in the past 12 months — is the latest in a number of online hackings that have affected a wide range of companies, including Target, Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase. It also potentially represents a high-profile example of hackers’ efforts to ransom stolen online data to companies or individuals. Such tactics, commonly known as ransomware, have often involved hackers encrypting people’s computer data and holding it hostage until a fee is paid. In certain instances, hackers have also stolen data directly from companies and demanded payment for not publishing the material online.Netflix falls 9% as weak subscriber additions at odds with lofty valuation: Investors questioned Netflix Inc's premium valuation after the video-streaming service reported U.S. subscriber additions below its own expectations, a sign that competition from the likes of Hulu is intensifying. Netflix shares fell more than 9 percent to $100.11 in early trading on Thursday. While Netflix blamed the disappointing numbers on the mandated transition to chip-based debit and credit cards, some analysts said the reason seemed unconvincing since these cards have been around for a while. \"The Netflix excuse is laughable,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, who is rated four stars on a scale of five on StarMine for the accuracy of earnings estimates of Netflix. \"Credit cards expire all the time, and people know how to deal with it. Netflix is seeing declining demand, and churn is a part of that,\" he said. Netflix doesn't disclose churn or subscriber attrition numbers. The video-streaming service provider had forecast a net addition of 1.15 million subscribers in its home market in the quarter, but ended up with just 880,000. Netflix's stock has more than doubled this year. It trades at 356.6 times forward 12 month earnings, versus a peer median of 12.9.Tesla Adds High-Speed Autonomous Driving to Its Bag of Tricks: It is not every day you get to open a door and step into the future. But to pull the handle on a newly updated Tesla Model S this week and slide into the driver’s seat was to catch a glimpse of the auto industry’s plans to soon let cars drive us, rather than the other way around. The updated Tesla, an already high-tech electric car that starts at about $75,000, was equipped with what the company calls Autopilot — a semi-autonomous feature that allows hands-free, pedal-free driving on the highway under certain conditions. The car will even change lanes autonomously at the driver’s request (by hitting the turn signal) and uses sensors to scan the road in all directions and adjust the throttle, steering and brakes. It is the first time that a production vehicle available to consumers will have such advanced self-driving capabilities. Or more to the point, the first time they will be unleashed for driving 70 miles per hour along twisty, though clearly marked, highways for long stretches. (Other manufacturers like Volvo and Mercedes-Benz recently introduced their own semiautonomous features, but limit the functions to lower speeds or require the driver to constantly touch the wheel.) And it’s perfectly legal. Among the states, only New York has any law prohibiting hands-free driving.Yahoo Mail Eliminates Passwords as Part of a Major Redesign: Seven months after replacing traditional passwords with single-use SMS codes, Yahoo is taking the next step toward blowing up the password altogether. The company today announced Yahoo Account Key, which links your account to a mobile device and then asks you to approve new logins through push notifications. It’s part of a broad redesign of Yahoo Mail designed to make the service faster and easier to search, and also lets you use the app with accounts from Outlook, Hotmail and AOL for the first time. (No Gmail, though, at least not yet)Music-streaming site Deezer files for $345M Paris IPO: Deezer SA is seeking at least 300 million euros ($343 million) in a Paris share sale, valuing the music-streaming site at as much as 1.1 billion euros as it tackles Spotify Ltd.’s bigger and better-known service and Apple Inc.’s more recent products. The initial public offering would value the French company at 900 million euros to 1.1 billion euros. Started in 2007 by Marhely, who quit school at 16 to work as a developer for Internet startups, Deezer had 6.3 million subscribers at the end of June, according to the IPO filing. The company, whose largest shareholders also include Leonard Blavatnik’s Access Industries, is smaller than Swedish rival Spotify, which has more than 20 million paying subscribers and was said to be valued at $8.5 billion in its most recent financing round.  As the competition in music streaming intensifies, companies are branching out into events and merchandising to make their services more appealing to consumers and artists. Last week, Pandora Media Inc., the world’s leading online radio service, paid $450 million for Ticketfly, a ticketing service. Deezer said Thursday it will partner with BandPage Inc. to include concert listings in artist profiles and alert fans to upcoming offers.Square, the Mobile Payments Company, Discloses I.P.O. Plans - Lost $77M on revenues of $561M in H1 2015: Jack Dorsey is about to get even busier. On Wednesday, one of the companies Mr. Dorsey runs, Square, the mobile payments start-up, made its initial public offering prospectus public, indicating it is close to a road show to sell stock to investors. The move follows an action-packed 10 days for the technology executive, who was named permanent chief of Twitter last week and who on Tuesday announced that he was laying off 8 percent of the staff at the social networking company as he tries to attract more users to the service. The disclosure of Square’s I.P.O. prospectus is set to quicken the pace for Mr. Dorsey. While the filing revealed that Square’s revenue jumped to $850 million last year, up 54 percent from a year earlier, losses increased to $154 million in 2014, more than in 2013. For the first six months of this year, Square lost $77 million on revenue of $561 million. That means Mr. Dorsey, 38, will need to sell a money-losing Square to investors when I.P.O.s — including recent technology offerings like Pure Storage — have been met with a lackluster reception. In addition, Mr. Dorsey faces questions about whether he can juggle his chief executive roles at Twitter and Square. Taking a company public and navigating the turnaround of another are each tall tasks on their own. Some critics have said Square’s core business does not make enough money to justify the lofty $6 billion valuation that it received from private investors. While Square said that more than two million merchants accepted five or more Square transactions last year, the company’s revenue is not as large as some other technology giants that it is often mentioned alongside. The filing also presented a rocky picture of a key partnership with Starbucks, the global coffee giant, which the two companies entered into in 2012. Square ended up losing tens of millions of dollars on the countless credit card transactions it processed for Starbucks customers, the filing showed. The deal, which is expected to wind down in 2016, will winnow away a significant portion of Square’s transaction volume.Square’s IPO Filing: It’s Complicated: Square recorded revenue of about $560 million in the first half of the year, a 51 percent increase over the first half of 2014. For the same period, losses were about flat year-over-year at about $78 million. That doesn’t look great. But a more nuanced look at the numbers, stripping out the Starbucks deal, tells a story of a healthier core business with even a path toward, yes, profitability. As a result, Square is making the case that that deal doesn’t reflect its core business, and it is right: Square loses money on Starbucks transactions, while Square makes money on the transactions it processes for all the other brick-and-mortar businesses it works with. Additionally, the metric subtracts other costs associated with things like stock-based compensation that fast-growing tech companies often argue don’t reflect the health of their main business. In the first half of the year, Square narrowed its Ebitda losses to $19 million from $44 million in the same period last year. And in the second quarter of this year, Square actually recorded an adjusted Ebtida profit, even if just barely. That’s a good sign.Jack Dorsey owns 24.4% - i.e. a lot -  of Square: No wonder Jack Dorsey wants to keep running Square. Dorsey, the payment company's chief executive officer who also just took on the same role at Twitter, is the largest shareholder in Square by a wide margin, with 24.4 percent. The investment firm Khosla Ventures is the second-largest with 17.3 percent, according to Square's registration for an initial public offering filed Oct. 14. Dorsey's sizable stake indicates that he was savvy enough to keep control of the company he co-founded. Dorsey's high-flying reputation as a Twitter co-founder helped him negotiate more favorable terms for Square than an untested entrepreneur trying to raise money could. Contrast Dorsey's position with that of, say, Box CEO Aaron Levie. When the file-storage company filed for an IPO in January, the 30-year-old Box co-founder owned 4 percent. While that still makes for a nice payout, six venture-capital firms owned more shares than Levie when the company went public. Or look at Dorsey's first venture, Twitter. Evan Williams, a Twitter co-founder along with Dorsey, provided the company with early financing, which helped him maintain a 12 percent stake by the time it went public. Meanwhile, Dorsey had 4.9 percent. This month, Dorsey was named \"permanent CEO\" of an ailing Twitter at the same time Square was prepping for an IPO. He's said he can handle both jobs, but investors are wondering how that will play out. In terms of ownership, he's got a lot more eggs in Square's basket. \"There are so many incentives for him to just spend all his time on Square,\" Lemkin said.Behind the Failure of Leap Transit’s Gentrified Buses in San Francisco: Leap, which raised $2.5 million from some of the industry’s best-known investors, charged riders $6 to get across San Francisco, nearly three times the cost of riding a city bus. Its primary draw was luxury. Each bus had a wood-trimmed interior outfitted with black leather seats, individual USB ports and Wi-Fi. The buses also offered a steady stream of high-end snacks, sold via app. The luxury vehicles were up for auction; Leap filed for bankruptcy in July. The end for Leap apparently came so suddenly that its founders didn’t have time to remove much from the vehicles. Inside each bus, sitting in an out-of-the-way parking lot near Oakland, Calif., was a state registration form pinned to the wall, a bundle of iPhone and HDMI cables, and a display case full of snacks. Among the choices were packages of That’s It — vegan, gluten-free, non-G.M.O. fruit bars — and organic, paleo Simple Squares. Leap is one of at least several dozen tech companies that have failed this year. Their deaths are illuminating; dead start-ups show us which investors’ theories are bogus, which technologies aren’t ready for prime time and which common ways founders overextend themselves. In particular, Leap’s death suggests one emerging cause of start-up doom, a problem that also did in the anonymous social network Secret: too close an association with Silicon Valley’s tech-bro sensibilities. Start-up deaths often go unstudied. Silicon Valley stands out for the way it embraces failure, and it’s true that the “We Failed!” start-up post-mortem note has become a staple on publishing sites like Medium. By the time of its bankruptcy auction earlier this month, which attracted only a handful of bidders, Leap was all but forgotten. In its bankruptcy filing, Leap reported that it made nearly $21,000 in the two months during which it offered service. That turned out to be less than two of its buses — which officials told me could no longer start — fetched at auction: One sold for $11,100, and another for $12,100.In Boost to Uber, Ola, India Said to Issue Guidelines for Ride-Hailing Apps: The rules, which aren’t binding, if implemented by the states will be a boost for Uber Technologies Inc. and its bigger competitor Ola that have faced bans in some cities such as capital New Delhi. This month China also proposed rules for ride-booking services that also ask operators to obtain licenses from local authorities and offer cars that are registered for commercial use. The guidelines, prepared by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, mandate ride-hailing companies obtain permits from respective state transport departments to operate in a region, the people said asking not to be identified before a public announcement. The states may set the maximum fares to be charged to provide a level playing field with taxis, according to the advisory. The vehicles to be offered must be equipped with a location tracking device as well as an emergency safety button. Drivers, who offer their services on multiple platforms, will need to have a commercial license and the company will have to obtain a police verification certificate.Apple loses patent lawsuit to University of Wisconsin, faces up to $862M in damages: Apple Inc could be facing up to $862 million in damages after a U.S. jury on Tuesday found the iPhone maker used technology owned by the University of Wisconsin-Madison's licensing arm without permission in chips found in many of its most popular devices. The jury in Madison, Wisconsin also said the patent, which improves processor efficiency, was valid. The trial will now move on to determine how much Apple owes in damages. Representatives for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment. WARF sued Apple in January 2014 alleging infringement of its 1998 patent for improving chip efficiency. The jury was considering whether Apple's A7, A8 and A8X processors, found in the iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus, as well as several versions of the iPad, violate the patent. Cupertino, California-based Apple denied any infringement and argued the patent is invalid, according to court papers. Apple previously tried to convince the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to review the patent's validity, but in April the agency rejected the bid. According to a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge William Conley, who is presiding over the case, Apple could be liable for up to $862.4 million in damages. He scheduled the trial to proceed in three phases: liability, damages, and finally, whether Apple infringed the patent willfully, which could lead to enhanced penalties.Dell buys EMC for $67 billion in largest deal in tech history: Dell announced Monday it had reached a deal to acquire cloud computing giant EMC for $67 billion -- the largest acquisition in the history of the technology industry. The deal signals that Dell believes it is best to go big at a time when many older technology firms such as Hewlett-Packard are paring down and becoming smaller, nimbler companies. Traditionally known as a personal PC-maker, Dell has more recently set its ambitions on the high-tech business world and portrayed itself as an all-in-one provider of equipment and services. Dell and equity firm Silver Lake Partners said in a press release Monday that buying EMC, a major data storage company, broadens its appeal to those lucrative corporate customers. In 2007, Dell returned to run the company he founded and took the company private again in 2013 with backing from Silver Lake Partners. The EMC transaction is expected to close in the “middle of next year,” executives said on a call with analysts Monday morning. It will take time for Dell and EMC to integrate their businesses if the deal closes, Hewitt said. For one, he noted that EMC has carved its niche by offering comprehensive — and not inexpensive — software solutions to businesses, which is where Dell wants to go. But, he noted, Dell's philosophy is deeply rooted in providing cost-efficiency. As Dell has struggled to adapt its PC business for the modern age, EMC has also been under pressure from activist investors to spin off its cloud and virtualization business called VMWare for more than year as its faced heavy competition from flash storage and cloud storage firms. It has also faced pointed questions about its \"federated\" business structure, which strung together three firms -- its traditional business, VMWare and its software development firm Pivotal. Analysts had formerly counted Dell, as well as HP, Cisco and Oracle, as potential buyers for the firm. Financing in the Dell-EMC Deal: Under the terms of the deal announced Monday, EMC has negotiated a \"go-shop\" provision in the preliminary deal that gives it the opportunity to seek out other buyers. Yet analysts say that while the Dell deal may slightly undervalue EMC shares, it's still a good deal. Shares of EMC rose about 1.5 percent during regular trading Monday. While the company will be a private concern after the deal is closed, a portion of its shares will continue to trade publicly. EMC investors will receive roughly $33.15 per share — they will receive $24.05 per share and a type of publicly tradeable stock \"linked to a portion of EMC’s economic interest\" in VMWare. Dell plans to pay $24.05 a share in cash plus tracking stock in EMC’s prize holding, software maker VMware Inc., valued at about $9 for each EMC share. EMC’s stock climbed 1.8 percent Monday to $28.35. Dell will add almost $50 billion to its debt load to complete the purchase, people familiar with the matter said, on top of the $11 billion it already is carrying. The combined company will be run by Michael Dell, the chief executive officer of the company he founded and took private for about $25 billion two years ago. He is financing the takeover with his MSD Partners investment vehicle, Silver Lake and Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek Holdings. He also is using debt, the VMware tracking stock and cash on hand. The deal will combine EMC’s dominance in devices that store data with closely held Dell’s No. 2 position in servers, the powerful machines that help companies handle big computing challenges.Implications for the Data Center Business: The deal will help Dell raise its profile in data centers, the modern factories of the digital age that house servers, networking gear and storage systems. EMC had 21 percent of the storage market last year, about twice what Dell had, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While Dell has been outperforming some of its rivals, the company is grappling with sagging demand for personal computers. During the third quarter, overall shipments declined 7.7 percent, according to Gartner Inc. Still, Dell was able to post a small gain of 0.5 percent while larger rivals declined.Implications for VMWare: EMC investors will receive roughly $33.15 per share — they will receive $24.05 per share and a type of publicly tradeable stock \"linked to a portion of EMC’s economic interest\" in VMWare. VMware declined 8 percent to $72.27 on Monday amid concern that the creation of a tracking stock will weigh on the company’s valuation. Analysts at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. lowered their target price for VMware to $75 from $95. EMC rival Pure Storage Inc. rose 8.8 percent to $18.06, exceeding its public offering price of $17 for the first time since shares began trading Wednesday.Silver Lake Had Explored Sale of Dell’s PC Business Ahead of EMC Deal: Private equity firm Silver Lake, co-owners of Dell, last week approached Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo and Huawei to explore the possibility of selling off Dell’s personal computing business, sources familiar with the matter told Re/code. But by Monday, Dell proposed to pay a combined $67 billion to acquire the data storage company EMC and its subsidiary VMware in what is the largest proposed technology M&A deal in history. It was not immediately clear if Silver Lake acted alone or if Dell was consulted. It is also unclear if Silver Lake or Dell would continue to explore a sale at this point. The approach comes as the once thriving PC industry grapples with declining sales. That’s partially why none of the parties that were approached engaged further. Nearly half of Dell’s annual revenue come from the PC business, or about $27 billion, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs.Apple Is Said to Deactivate Its News App in China: Apple has disabled its news app in China, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation, the most recent sign of how difficult it can be for foreign companies to manage the strict rules governing media and online expression there. The Apple News app, which the company announced in June, is available only to users in the United States, though it is being tested in Britain and Australia. Customers who already downloaded the app by registering their phones in the United States can still see content in it when they travel overseas — but they have found that it does not work in China. Those in China who look at the top of the Apple News feed, which would normally display a list of selected articles based on a user’s preferred media, instead see an error message: “Can’t refresh right now. News isn’t supported in your current region.” Greater China is now Apple’s second-largest source of revenue after the United States, with sales of more than $13 billion in the third quarter. That means the company is most likely taking a careful approach to delivering new content, like that on its news app, within China. Beijing generally insists that companies are responsible for censoring content inside China. In Apple’s case, that would mean it would probably have to develop a censorship system — most Chinese companies use a combination of automated software and employees — to eliminate sensitive articles from feeds. For now, Apple seems to be avoiding the problem by completely disabling the service for users in China.How Do You Value A Company Like Uber? I became interested in Uber after reading a news story in June 2014, which reported the company was being valued at $17 billion in its latest venture capital round. I posted my first valuation of Uber in June 2014, viewing it as an urban car service, with local (but not global) networking benefits. Assuming that it would increase the size of the urban car service market by about 40%, while preserving its low capital-investment business model, I valued Uber at just under $6 billion. While some in the VC community were quick to dismiss the valuation, I will remain grateful to Bill Gurley for a post where he took me to task for having too narrow a vision of Uber’s business model. In his counter narrative, he argued that Uber was not just urban (it could create inroads in suburbia), not just a car service (it was in logistics & transportation) and that it was working with other businesses to create global networking benefits. Since Bill, as an early investor in Uber with access to its internal workings, clearly knew far more about the company than I did, I revalued Uber using his narrative and arrived at $54 billion as the value that reflected the narrative. I was wrong about Uber’s value in June 2014, when my estimate of $6 billion was below the $17 billion assessment by venture capitalists then. Correcting for both my cramped vision and the changes that have occurred since June 2014, my estimated value today is $23.4 billion. I know my estimated value lags the $51 billion value that VCs are attaching to the company today. This may very well be a reflection that my vision is still too cramped to capture Uber’s possible businesses, but it is what it is.SingPost Doubles Down on E-Commerce With U.S., European Services: Singapore Post Ltd., which counts Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as its second-biggest shareholder, plans to expand freight services and warehouses in the U.S. and Europe as Asia’s emerging middle class drives online purchases from overseas. The move comes as other postal companies in Asia also are looking to reinvent themselves. Japan Post Group, a $2.5 trillion behemoth that also function as a bank and insurer, is preparing an initial public offering and looking to expand internationally after buying Australian logistics company Toll Holdings Ltd. earlier this year. SingPost holds a monopoly on mail delivery in its home base, which accounts for about 80 percent of its operating profit, but is looking for new areas of growth as more people use mobile phones and access the Internet. Worldwide business-to-consumer sales could grow 34 percent to $675 billion in 2016 from last year as the global middle class grows, SingPost said, citing data from researcher eMarketer.DocuSign CEO resigns as company heads toward IPO: source. The chief executive officer of DocuSign has resigned, according to an internal memo, signaling a leadership change for a well-funded tech company that is on the brink of an initial public offering. Keith Krach, chairman and CEO of DocuSign, a San Francisco company that makes software to add legally compliant electronic signatures to documents, told employees in a memo the company would begin a search for his successor. Krach became CEO four years ago and has been chairman for seven. Sources familiar with the company say Krach will continue to have a significant presence there. He will stay on as chairman for at least three more years. He is also one of DocuSign's largest individual shareholders. Krach will remain CEO until a replacement is named. A search has begun, and the board is looking at both internal and external candidates. The next logical step for the company is an IPO, according to the source who asked not to be named because the plans are confidential. DocuSign, valued at $3 billion, aims to replace one of the final paper-and-pen aspects of business transactions: the signature. It is available in more than 40 languages and about 188 countries. DocuSign recently closed a Series F funding round that exceeded $300 million and now has well over $500 million in financing.Amazon plays a long game with AWS: Amazon Web Services doesn’t just want to dominate the global business in selling computing online. It also wants to be the rarest thing of all in the technology industry: a long-lived company. Its strategy hinges on an unprecedented level of automation in computer programming and maintenance, coupled with offering new products and services at a rate none of the old-guard companies seem able to match. The idea seems to be to dominate not so much by the traditional “vendor lock-in” of hooking customers on proprietary technology, but by making itself the center of the styles and habits of cloud computing. At least some of its customers seem to think that will work. On Wednesday, Jim Fowler, the chief information officer of General Electric, said, “A.W.S. will be the trusted partner that will run our company’s information technology for the next 140 years.” That’s how long G.E., founded by Thomas Edison, has been around. Mr. Fowler was talking at the annual A.W.S. conference, during a session in which the company indirectly made the case that it would go after all of the existing customers of some of the biggest technology companies around. Among other offerings, A.W.S. plans to send customers machines that will extract an Oracle database, say, and send it to A.W.S. to be transformed to a cheaper cloud product. G.E. had at one point thought of building its own cloud, but it went with Amazon in part because of this know-how. A.W.S. also introduced a range of new technology products, including automated creation of mobile software applications, automated large- and small-scale data analysis systems in real time, and ways of building software that can be managed easily across the globe from a single location. There were, of course, also ways to make these parts fit together, mostly in automated forms that configured and managed most of the underlying technology. To work with it all, last week A.W.S. published a 56-page manual on how to build and run software in A.W.S. “Cloud is the new normal,” Werner Vogels, Amazon’s chief technology officer, said to a roomful of several thousand software engineers on Thursday. “This is how you will build your applications.” Certainly, a good part of A.W.S. software is open source, which means it could be used elsewhere, and companies like Microsoft and Google also have big clouds. But neither of them, nor IBM, which also wants the cloud business, created more than 500 new features and services last year, as A.W.S. did. That raises an interesting prospect. A.W.S. does not have a lot of the proprietary technology or onerous contracts that have traditionally held captive the customers of big enterprise software companies. Amazon may be creating a kind of casual lock-in of its own: All this automation, features and standardization of practices could mean that in several years most young engineers will know how to work in the A.W.S. system, but none other. That’s not exactly a hostage situation, but it would hold companies.Facing China Slowdown, Alibaba and JD Find Solace in Russia: Russia’s plunging currency hasn’t weened consumers off foreign goods. Instead, cash-strapped shoppers are turning to online retailers for imported smartphones, jewelry and clothes, giving an unexpected boost to Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc. Alibaba’s AliExpress site posted a 40 percent increase in Russian visitors to 22 million in July compared with a year earlier, according to researcher TNS. JD.com, which gets more than half its sales from electronics and home appliances, started its first international site in June in Russia, exclusively offering devices such as Xiaomi Corp. smartphones for about $214. That’s less than half of what an IPhone or Samsung Electronics Co. model with similar technical specifications costs locally. Millions of Russians are sinking into poverty as the collapse in crude prices drags down the economy of the world’s biggest energy exporter, sends the ruble into a tailspin and cuts government revenue. In August, wages fell 9.8 percent in real terms and Russians now face significantly lower disposable income than a year ago. While the economy may be in recession, Russians are embracing deliveries from China. Some 80 million people go online in Russia, making it Europe’s largest Internet market by users, according to East-West Digital News. However, the number of Web shoppers is still about a third of that, compared with 70 percent to 90 percent in the U.S. and western Europe.Netflix is raising its prices again. Netflix announced Thursday that it will raise its prices again, this time by $1 to $9.99 a month, giving the streaming video service more money to develop original content. The price increase will take effect on Nov. 11 for new customers. Existing customers will continue to pay the current rate, $8.99 a month, until October 2016. Longtime customers who still pay $7.99 a month will hold onto that rate until at least May 2016. The change may reflect that it is getting more expensive for Netflix and other video distributors to secure deals for television and movie content. In August, Netflix announced it would not renew a deal with cable network Epix, costing U.S. subscribers access to some high-profile movies including \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" \"World War Z\" and \"Transformers: Age of Extinction.\" Rival Hulu quickly swooped in to make a deal of its own with Epix. The price hike will allow the company to offer more original content, said company spokeswoman Anne Marie Squeo. This year alone, Netflix introduced more than two dozen new series or films, including “Narcos,” a popular crime drama focusing on the life of Pablo Escobar and his Medellin drug cartel.Microsoft’s Mission to Reignite PC Sector May Be Taking Hold: Shipments of personal computers fell nearly 11 percent last quarter, to the shock of almost no one. Sales have been declining for so long — 14 consecutive quarters — that it is becoming harder to remember a time when PCs ruled the tech world. Yet despite all that movement — or maybe because of it — something curious has emerged in recent months: optimism. “Initiatives like Surface and Surface Book have helped the industry wake up and say, ‘We’ve got to make the industry cool and sexy again,’ ” said Frank Azor, executive director and general manager of Dell’s XPS line of PCs. The stated reason that Microsoft got into the PC hardware business three years ago, with the original Surface, was not to put PC companies out of business. The company said the goal was to better illustrate the capabilities of its software, providing devices that would inspire PC makers to be more innovative. Analysts and industry executives say the strategy may be starting to work. Dell, which still sells millions of PCs, announced on Thursday several new machines that run Windows 10, a new Microsoft operating system. One of them, the XPS 12, is similar to Microsoft’s Surface Book, a “two-in-one” device that combines the keyboard of a traditional laptop with a touch-sensing screen that can be detached for use as a tablet. The Microsoft event on Tuesday, where the Surface Book was introduced, generated the kind of buzz from the tech press that’s normally reserved for an Apple event. Apple itself generated discussion last month about whether it has begun to imitate Microsoft by announcing a new big-screen tablet with a stylus, the iPad Pro. The Surface has been available with a big screen and a stylus for some time.  It remains to be seen whether these efforts will result in more sales. Microsoft has seen terrific growth in its Surface business, which has jumped to $3.6 billion in annual sales from nothing three years ago. But most other big PC makers have not been able to get customers to spend on PCs as they once did. PC owners are holding on to their machines longer, making do with systems that are good enough for their needs. At the same time, they are relying on mobile devices for more of their computing tasks. On Thursday, IDC, the technology research firm, said that global PC shipments declined 10.8 percent in the third quarter from the same period a year ago, slightly worse than the research firm had expected. (Another research firm, Gartner, had pegged the decline at 7.7 percent.)Singapore Post, Like Amazon, Tests Package Delivery by Drone: Singapore Post Ltd. is testing package delivery by drone, echoing attempts by Amazon.com Inc. to extend the commercial capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles. The company known as SingPost said a drone it developed with the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore carried a packet containing a letter and T-shirt on a five-minute, two-kilometer (1.2 miles) flight. This marks the first time any postal service has successfully used a drone for “point-to-point recipient-authenticated mail delivery,” it said in a statement Thursday. SingPost is looking to such unmanned aircraft as online transactions increase in the Asia-Pacific region and as Singapore plans to develop itself into a so-called Smart Nation through technology usage. There is “immense potential” in drone technology for last-mile mail and e-commerce delivery, Bernard Leong, SingPost’s head of digital services, said in the statement.Snapdeal invests $20M more in logistics firm gojavas: Jasper Infotech Pvt Ltd, which runs online e-com marketplace Snapdeal, has invested $20 million (Rs 131 crore) more in logistics firm QuickDel Logistics Pvt Ltd, which runs operations under the gojavas brand, it said on Wednesday. Snapdeal had first invested in gojavas, which was previously a part of Jabong, a lifestyle e-tailer incubated by Rocket Internet, in March this year. It had not disclosed the investment amount but said it has picked a minority stake in the logistics firm. “The company’s average timeline for delivering Snapdeal orders has reduced by a full 24 hours in the last six months and our teams have worked closely to come up with innovative solutions that are enhancing customers’ shopping experience on Snapdeal. With the freshly infused funds, our aim is to help gojavas become more successful and expand their reach,” said Rohit Bansal, co-founder of Snapdeal. Snapdeal said it has invested $100 million in the last six months to improve it delivery timelines by 70 per cent and it will invest $200 million more in next 12 months to strengthen its supply chain. gojavas will be using the capital for expanding its operations to 100 more cities within 12 months. Vijay Ghadge, COO at gojavas, said the partnership with Snapdeal has helped it become one of the largest independent logistics players in the country with a revenue run rate of Rs 500 crore currently. gojavas currently manages over 1 lakh sq ft of fulfilment centres and helps more than 400 companies reach consumers in close to 350 cities and towns in more than 3,000 PIN-codes. It claims to deliver over 1.8 lakh packages every day and closed FY15 with revenues of over Rs 200 crore. It was originally an in-house delivery venture of Jabong but later spun out as a separate third-party logistics firm.Pandora Buys Ticketfly, a Competitor to Ticketmaster: Pandora Media, the biggest player in Internet radio, has moved into the ticketing business with an agreement to buy Ticketfly, an independent firm that competes with Ticketmaster and is popular with clubs and festivals in the United States and Canada. Pandora announced early Wednesday that it would acquire Ticketfly for $450 million, in a mix of cash and stock. The deal further expands Pandora’s interests in providing services to artists. Last year, it introduced a data system, the Artist Marketing Platform, or AMP, that shows musicians which songs are most popular on the service and where. And in May, Pandora bought Next Big Sound, another data service, which studies the listening and searching patterns of streaming music customers. Pandora, which has nearly 80 million regular listeners, said that its acquisition would benefit artists and listeners. The deal will also add a level of complexity to the sometimes delicate system of alliances in the ticketing world, which is dominated by Ticketmaster, a unit of Live Nation Entertainment. Ticketfly, which was founded in 2008 and was an early proponent of using social media and the web to market tickets, has become a popular choice for promoters that want to avoid the Ticketmaster system. Last year, according to its announcement with Pandora, Ticketfly sold 16 million tickets worth more than $500 million. Among Ticketfly’s clients are the club Brooklyn Bowl and the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago. This year, the independent ticketing world was jolted when Ticketmaster bought Front Gate Tickets, another service popular with clubs, festivals and acts, a move that led some bands, like Wilco, to shift their alliances to other companies. Pandora’s control of Ticketfly could pose a challenge to Ticketmaster, particularly given Pandora’s history of using its user data for marketing. The company, which derives about 80 percent of its revenue from ad sales, has long pitched advertisers on its ability to identify its users based on their demographic data and listening habits — even going so far as to say it can predict its listeners’ political affiliation. “The combination of Ticketfly and Pandora will be a marketing and event discovery powerhouse.”If Your Wi-Fi Is Terrible, Check Your Router: Bob McConnell, a retired engineer, set up a new wireless router in his home this year to get faster Internet speeds. Instead, he got the opposite, with his iPad often getting no wireless connection in his bedroom. For days, he tinkered with the router’s settings, but couldn’t figure out a fix. “It was totally ruining my life,” said Mr. McConnell, who lives in a condominium building in Kirkland, Wash. “Things would work, and then the next morning they wouldn’t work again.” What Mr. McConnell experienced is a situation we call “Wi-Fi headache,” and it’s an ailment that many can relate to. The condition is rooted in the networking devices called routers that people install in their homes for Wi-Fi connectivity. Most routers are difficult to configure for anyone who doesn’t work in an information technology department. Jargony tech terms like 802.11 or dual-band add to the confusion when people upgrade a router or try to decide which one to pick. So to diagnose and cure Wi-Fi headaches, we teamed up with The Wirecutter, the product recommendations website. The Wirecutter put dozens of top-rated routers and devices through hundreds of hours of testing to pick out the best router for most people and come up with other recommendations tailored to different living situations and budgets. It also ran new tests for The New York Times to come up with best practices for getting a stronger, faster Wi-Fi signal. The bottom line: People with devices both new and old will see an improvement by upgrading to a recent router that supports the latest Wi-Fi standards. But they should be wary of buying a cheap router that isn’t any good, or spending too much on one that is too complex for their needs.Pure Storage Falls In Public Debut, CEO Optimistic: Pure Storage, the enterprise storage company, went public on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday. After pricing at $17, shares traded down in its debut, closing the day at $16.01. CEO Scott Dietzen spoke to TechCrunch about why the company executed an IPO during what has been a lackluster year for tech stocks. “We were ready to be a public company,” said Dietzen. “We don’t worry about market conditions. Great companies can come out when it’s right for them.” The company’s IPO performance, slipping in its first day’s trading, isn’t big news. Other recent IPOs that have seen sharp declines in value following their flotation have performed more strongly. For example, Box, a tech company that went public this year, surged on its initial day as a public company. In the ensuing months, its shares have sagged. For industry watchers, any current public technology offering is a bellwether. The IPO cadence for technology firms has been infamously slow in 2015, causing concern among those both seeking liquidity for their investments, and executives worried about where their private valuation might square with the public markets. To underscore that point, Dropbox, a company that could formerly do no wrong, recently endured an embarrassing haircut. Pure Storage’s offering went off mid-range. It fell a modest 5.8 percent. These things are not the end of the world. But they may describe public investor uncertainty about the value of firms that are burning large quantities of cash to expand their top line. Box, MobileIron, and a host of others have endured related declines.Bill Gurley on Tech Bubble: I’m a Pragmatist, Not a Doomsayer:  Bill Gurley, general partner at venture capital firm Benchmark, has developed a reputation as the Nostradamus of Silicon Valley. He has repeatedly called out startups and fellow investors for over-the-top valuations, warning of an impending tech bubble. He isn’t ditching that reputation. “It’s kind of my responsibility to call it out,” the venture capitalist said at the Vanity Fair Summit in San Francisco on Tuesday. “If you’re in a car heading over a cliff and I say, ‘Hey, slow down’ — that’s being a pragmatist, not being a doomsayer.” New York Times reporter Nick Bilton, who moderated the panel, asked Gurley how he squares that view with the fact that Benchmark is among the venture firms priming startups with cash. Gurley’s retort: The founders he backs could raise money in any condition — and could do it even better when funding dries up. “Most of the great CEOs I work with want this to stop. They’re forced to play this game,” he replied. “Great entrepreneurs raise money in any cycle. When there’s less money available, the better entrepreneurs have the advantage.”Data Transfer Pact Between U.S. and Europe Is Ruled Invalid: Europe’s highest court on Tuesday struck down an international agreement that allowed companies to move digital information like people’s web search histories and social media updates between the European Union and the United States. The decision left the international operations of companies like Google and Facebook in a sort of legal limbo even as their services continued working as usual. The ruling, by the European Court of Justice, said the so-called safe harbor agreement was flawed because it allowed American government authorities to gain routine access to Europeans’ online information. The court said leaks from Edward J. Snowden, the former contractor for the National Security Agency, made it clear that American intelligence agencies had almost unfettered access to the data, infringing on Europeans’ rights to privacy. The court said data protection regulators in each of the European Union’s 28 countries should have oversight over how companies collect and use online information of their countries’ citizens. European countries have widely varying stances toward privacy. Data protection advocates hailed the ruling. Industry executives and trade groups, though, said the decision left a huge amount of uncertainty for big companies, many of which rely on the easy flow of data for lucrative businesses like online advertising. They called on the European Commission to complete a new safe harbor agreement with the United States, a deal that has been negotiated for more than two years and could limit the fallout from the court’s decision. Some European officials and many of the big technology companies, including Facebook and Microsoft, tried to play down the impact of the ruling. The companies kept their services running, saying that other agreements with the European Union should provide an adequate legal foundation. But those other agreements are now expected to be examined and questioned by some of Europe’s national privacy watchdogs. The potential inquiries could make it hard for companies to transfer Europeans’ information overseas under the current data arrangements. And the ruling appeared to leave smaller companies with fewer legal resources vulnerable to potential privacy violations. “We can’t assume that anything is now safe,” Brian Hengesbaugh, a privacy lawyer with Baker & McKenzie in Chicago who helped to negotiate the original safe harbor agreement. “The ruling is so sweepingly broad that any mechanism used to transfer data from Europe could be under threat.”Microsoft is making its first-ever laptop: Under the leadership of chief executive Satya Nadella, the message out of Microsoft has been one of collaboration rather than competition. Since Nadella took over in February of last year, the historically sharp-elbowed firm has seemed to soften. A humbler Microsoft emerged, putting a greater focus on helping consumers use its products on whatever device they wanted, rather than being its own cheerleader. But Microsoft showed that its competitive spark is alive and well Tuesday with the announcement that it's making its first-ever laptop. The laptop, called the Surface Book, has a 13.5-inch screen and weighs 3.34 pounds with a detachable keyboard -- clearly putting it in competition with Apple's MacBook Air and the many, many Microsoft partners who make the class of lightweight laptops known as ultrabooks. (So does its starting $1,499 price tag.) The Book can be used as a tablet or as more traditional laptop.Google Told by Russian Regulator to Unbundle Android Search: Russia’s antitrust regulator has ordered Google  to amend agreements with smartphone producers that it said disadvantage third-party applications on devices running the Android operating system. Mountain View, California-based Google is abusing its market dominance through Android, the regulator ruled last month after a complaint from local search engine provider Yandex, which has been losing market share to its U.S. rival on mobile devices. Google has allowed Android-phone producers to use its application store Google Play on the condition that they also pre-install services from the company, including search, and prioritize those icons on screens, the Russian regulator said Sept. 14. Yandex has said Android’s default options push mobile users to Google services, limiting consumers’ ability to choose such services from Yandex or other vendors. “To restore competition on the market, Google should amend agreements with mobile-device producers within a month and exclude the anti-competitive clauses,” Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said in a statement on its Website on Monday. Yandex shares rose as much as 13 percent in U.S. trading and were up 7.3 percent at $12.17 at 12:40 pm in New York. Yandex’s share in Russian search fell to 50 percent in August versus 54 percent at the start of 2014, while Google’s share rose to almost 42 percent from 34 percent, according to LiveInternet.ru. Google may also face a fine of 1 percent to 15 percent of the revenue from the services where the violation occurred, according to the regulator.Legal troubles, market realities threaten Uber's global push: Uber Inc's aggressive global expansion is looking costlier and riskier than ever as the company struggles with regulatory and competitive obstacles in major markets. Just last week, the company faced a police raid on its European headquarters in the Netherlands, a criminal trial of two top executives in France, a ban on its services in Rio de Janeiro and proposed new regulations in London and Toronto that could cripple its services in those cities. The Uber Pop service, known as Uber X in the U.S., which enables people to offer rides in private cars, is now banned outright in most of Western Europe. In Australia, Uber is popular but mostly illegal, with several big court challenges looming. Meanwhile, in China and other Asian countries Uber faces increasingly powerful competitors and idiosyncratic local transportation markets. Uber has in some cases responded by moving into businesses like car rental - which could be viewed as a nimble response to local conditions or a risky move into a low-margin, capital intensive business. That's on top of the challenge to its business model that Uber faces in its home state of California, where a class action lawsuit could force the company to treat its contract drivers as employees. Taken together, Uber's recent troubles raise the question of whether the firm's headlong drive for global market share, underwritten by more than $7 billion in venture capital investment, is a prudent strategy. It has moved far more quickly in its global expansion than any company in memory--it's now in 60 countries after being founded in 2009 --and the cost and complexity of so many legal wars and subsidizing millions of rides in countries like China could tax even a company as wealthy as Uber. In the U.S. alone, Uber has been involved in at least 173 U.S. lawsuits since October 2012, a review of Westlaw dockets shows, while rival Lyft has been involved in 66 and lodging service Airbnb has been a party to just 20. As a private company Uber discloses little about its spending but one indicator of the scale is its $1.2 billion funding for its China unit in September. Leaked financial documents show Uber overall lost more than $100 million in the 2nd quarter of 2014. \"Uber is adopting the shock and awe strategy,\" said Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at NYU's Stern School of Business. \"I think it's a very high risk strategy.\"Report: Google Invests In Wall Street Messaging Tool Symphony: Google has participated in a new round of funding for Symphony Communication Services, valuing the company at $650 million, reports Dow Jones. The deal is expected to close this week. Launched last year, the Palo Alto-based messaging service has previously received financing from Wall Street giants including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and BlackRock. Symphony hopes its communications software will compete with Bloomberg’s financial terminal business, by providing news and research from Dow Jones. Symphony built a cloud communications service, which is compliant with FINRA and Sarbanes-Oxley, no easy task. Of course, you can have Slack-like conversations and create virtual discussion rooms, both public and private, but the trick is that there are special rules around who can talk to whom and the system has to respect the rules. Users can also do things like follow certain subjects via a hashtag system, so they can easily track a particular industry within the platform by setting up a set of rules, allowing people to track content, conversations and public social chatter about subjects that matter to them. The product is actually available for free for anyone who wants to use it as of last month, but if a company wants the all of the security and tracking ability, of course, they will need to buy the enterprise version. It’s possible that Google sees the potential of this tool beyond the financial services industry and that’s why it’s investing in the company at this point. Secure communication with the ability to track content could have wide reaching use for both consumers and businesses alike and Google could want a piece of that action. In July, the Wall Street Journal reported that Symphony was looking to raise funding at up to a $1 billion valuation.Google Inc has morphed into Alphabet Inc.: After U.S. markets closed on Friday, Alphabet replaced Google as the publicly traded company that will house Google's search and Web advertising businesses, maps, YouTube and its \"moonshot\" ventures such as driverless cars. Google's class A shares and class C shares will automatically convert into the same number of Alphabet class A shares and class C shares and start trading on the Nasdaq from Monday. The ticker symbols will not change. The core businesses will be called Google and operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Sundar Pichai will head Google. Alphabet will be run by Google co-founder Larry Page and each of its businesses will have its own chief executive. Starting from the company's fourth quarter in January, Alphabet will have two reporting units - Google and all other Alphabet businesses taken as a whole.Pew stuty of teen dating measures effects of social media and technology: Ah, young love. Many of us may remember the intensity and ecstasy of puppy love. But how have those relationships changed in an era of constant communication, oversharing and emoji? That's what a new study into teen dating, published Thursday by the Pew Research Center, explored in-depth. The study takes a look at how social media and technology weave into every stage of the dating process, from flirting to breakup. There's a lot of digital flirting going on -- one boy said that his way of flirting is to put \"a bunch of emojis\" under a girl's  photo. But asking someone out in person is still the most common way to start a relationship. Over three-quarters of teens said they've never dated someone they initially met online, though a quarter did admit they have dated (or hooked up) with people they met first online. One thing is for certain: if Romeo and Juliet had carried out their romance today, they probably would have avoided their catastrophic communication breakdown. Thirty-eight percent of teens who date expect to hear from their partners at least once per day; 11 percent expect to hear from their partner every hour. That doesn't mean, however, that teens necessarily like this constant communication. Sure, many teen daters have used online messages or texts to resolve arguments (48 percent) or just engage in conversations that makes them feel closer to each other (70 percent). But 43 percent have also found themselves in situations where they think their partner is distracted by their gadgets during their alone time. The study also explored some questions of gender differences. Girls, for example, are much more likely to experience unwanted flirting, mirroring another Pew finding that women are more likely to be the victims of online harassment. Male and female teens, however, reported that there are definitely times when partners have crossed the line. Online tools can also exacerbate jealous tendencies, the study found, and 69 percent of teens reported that they think social media in particular gives too many people a window into their private lives. Many teens told researchers that pressure to post about their relationships made them present a less authentic picture of their lives. Others said they stayed away from posting too much about their dating lives online because it leads to \"drama\";  one teen said it was because \"more people ask questions and stuff like that.\" Digital communication had its role to play at the end of relationships as well, researchers found, but in some ways teens were surprisingly traditional. Yes, there were slivers of teens -- 7 percent each -- that think it's perfectly fine to break with someone by proxy or by just changing your social media status to \"single.\" (That's cold, kids.) What it’s like to ride in a Google self-driving car: Google’s cars have been trained to be extremely conservative in unusual situations. “They understand their own limitations,” said Dmitri Dolgov, principle engineer on Google’s self-driving car project, at a briefing later. “They understand that there’s something really crazy going on and they might not be able to make really good, confident predictions about the future. So they take a very conservative approach.” A few blocks away from Google I got another glimpse of the SUV’s cautious nature. A car, also with a stop sign, arrived at the intersection just after us. The Google car inched forward in two spurts. After a pause we drove through the intersection. We got through it fine, but slower than I expect most drivers would have. Soon we pull back in front of GoogleX’s building, a 14-minute ride in the books. “Manual,” calls out the female voice as our driver took control again, and turned the car off. If I was grading the SUV on our brief trek I would give it a B+. It wasn’t perfect driving, but safe and effective. Of course, our route wasn’t especially difficult. The real challenges come when pedestrians, inclement weather, construction sites and cyclists arrive.Microsoft, Google stand down in patent battles: Microsoft and Google have agreed to bury all patent infringement litigation against each other, the companies announced on Wednesday, settling 18 cases in the United States and Germany. In another sign of the winding down of the global smartphone wars, the companies said the deal puts an end to court fights involving a variety of technologies, including mobile phones, wifi, and patents used in Microsoft's Xbox game consoles and other Windows products. The agreement also drops all litigation involving Motorola Mobility, which Google sold to Lenovo last year while keeping its patents. However, as Microsoft and Google continue to make products that compete directly with each other, including search engines and mobile computing devices, the agreement notably does not preclude any future infringement lawsuits, a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed.Sources: Jack Dorsey Expected to Be Named Permanent Twitter CEO: Jack is apparently back — for good this time. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who has been serving as interim CEO for the past three months, is expected be named the company’s new permanent CEO as early as tomorrow, although that timeframe may change, according to sources. Dorsey will apparently continue to run Square, the payments company he founded where he’s also CEO. [UPDATE: Sources said that it’s not clear if the board has officially voted on Dorsey’s appointment, because it was still settling the status of other key execs this week, most specifically revenue chief Adam Bain and CFO Anthony Noto. Bain is widely expected to become COO, although Noto may also report directly to Dorsey. Both have indicated to the board, said multiple sources, that they want Dorsey in the top job. The Twitter board also has what one source called a “Plan B” of a single serious outside candidate, although every single person I have contacted who has been considered and also contacted by the company’s recruiting firm, Spencer Stuart, said that discussions did not progress very far.] Sources added that there is likely to be some shake-up of the board too, most immediately the departure of Costolo as a director.Alibaba, Ant Financial invest about $680 million in Paytm, up stake to 40%: Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba has made a strategic investment in One97 Communications, the parent company of Paytm, along with its affiliate Ant Financial, which had made its first investment in February 2015. With this, Alibaba becomes a new investor in the Indian online payment and e-commerce firm. Two people aware of the details told ET that the Alibaba Group Holding will pick up about 20% stake through a fresh issue of shares by investing about $680 million(around Rs4,450 crore). The deal has been closed. In February, Ant Financial had picked up a 25% stake for $575 million, of which $200 million came in as the first tranche. The fresh investment by Alibaba Group Holdings subsumes the outstanding tranche of $375 million, and will see Ant Financial's stake being lowered to 20%, one of the people aware of the details said.? Alibaba will now hold around 20%. With this, Alibaba will become the biggest shareholder in the company as it will hold 40% through two entities, and Paytm will be its ecommerce play in India. Under the financial contours of the transaction, existing investor Saif Partners' stake comes down to 30% from 37% while Paytm's founder and Chairman & Managing Director Vijay Shekhar Sharma now owns about 21%, down from 27%.Hands-On With Google’s New Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X Smartphones: Google announced its newest pair of Android smartphones, the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X. This is the first time since the Nexus line was launched, in 2010, that Google is releasing two phones at once. Each is targeted at a different segment of the market, but they both share a number of critical features for wooing customers. The 6P is Google’s new flagship, the successor to last year’s Nexus 6. The original Nexus 6 was made by Motorola (owned by Google at the time, though since bought by Lenovo) and was met with mixed reactions from critics and customers. It was big, the camera wasn’t as good as those in competing phones, and it was roughly twice the price of its own predecessor, the Nexus 5. The 6P is the first Nexus phone made by Chinese company Huawei, and it tries to fix what was wrong with the 6 while bringing a few new things to the party. The smaller Nexus 5X, manufactured by LG, is just over five inches long and has an ultrasensitive camera that is designed to work better indoors, where people take most of their pictures. It starts at $379 for an entry-level phone without a contract. The other larger phone, the Nexus 6P, which is made by Huawei, is 5.7 inches and starts at $499. Both phones use a new kind of charging cable, called USB Type-C, that powers up more quickly and has a symmetrical charging port so people won’t have to fumble to figure out which way to plug it in. Nexus runs what Google calls the “purest” form of its Android operating system. The devices come with a few Google apps but are otherwise free of so-called bloatware — software loaded onto a device by a phone maker — that can slow the device. Also, Nexus products receive monthly security updates and come with the latest version of Android, making them a kind of showcase for new Google products.The ‘Oh, Shit!’ Moment When Growth Stops: Most high-growth businesses stare down periods when growth unexpectedly slows down or stops altogether. At some point, that stomach-churning moment has visited the leadership of most of the companies I’ve advised. We also faced it at OpenTable, eBay and Reel.com when I was managing them. And it has reputedly happened to a number of today’s mightiest Internet businesses as well, including the likes of Amazon and Facebook. CEOs at high-tech businesses work hard to keep as much growth going for as long as possible. Investors — both public and private — tend to value growth over everything else during most investment cycles, and the recent cycle has been no exception. Growth is where all the action is, and to where all the money flows. The reason for this is that the majority of returns are driven by a handful of companies that “break out.” And a business can’t get big enough to break out if it isn’t growing. Entrepreneurs’ reactions to these moments fall into one of two extremes: There is the preternaturally calm CEO who resolves to watch the metrics closely to see if they change; he or she is concerned that a hint of panic will cause the rest of the team to panic, so they “Zen it out” as best they can. Then there is the CEO who freaks out, setting off alarm bells that reverberate throughout the entire building and continue ringing in every single employee’s ears. Which approach do I advocate? The freak-out, of course! Why? Because the unexpected slowing of growth in a “growth” business presents an existential risk to the company. Growth rates over a company’s history tend to move only one way over time (down); even in hypergrowth companies, growth rates tend to fall to earth … which is why I’ve referred to this effect as “gravity.” Once gravity takes hold, it’s very hard to reaccelerate the growth of the business. Slowing growth portends a strong possibility that the company will never again experience prior levels of growth going forward. There are precious few examples of this happening on a sustained basis: Amazon accomplished it during 2010-2011, contributing to its value today. We accomplished this during my tenure at OpenTable, leading to a fourfold growth in market cap over six quarters. But growth will never resume magically. If CEOs can figure out what exactly happened to cause that slowdown, it presents them with the opportunity to try to correct what went wrong.Exclusive: Airbnb to double bookings to 80 million this year - investors: Airbnb is expected to double its nightly bookings this year, investors familiar with the company's performance said, a sign that the home and room renting site's battles with regulators have yet to dent its rapid global growth. The website is expected to have about 80 million nights booked this year, up from about 40 million in 2014, according to the investors, who declined to be named. This pace of growth is expected to continue or accelerate, the investors said. The company says it has more than 1.5 million listings - homes, apartments, guest rooms, even houseboats and tree houses - in more than 34,000 cities in 190 countries. \"It's a global phenom,\" said Keith Rabois, a partner at Khosla Ventures who made an early personal investment in Airbnb in 2010. \"(It) is going to continue to grow at a substantially higher rate than other businesses.\"Uber’s Chinese rival Didi Kuaidi invests in Ola: Didi Kuaidi, which competes with Uber  for a slice of China’s taxi-hailing market, has invested an undisclosed amount in India’s largest cab aggregator Ola. The investment is said to be part of the recent $225 million funding round led by Ola’s existing investors Falcon Edge Capital, Tiger Global Management and Japan’s SoftBank.  Ola claims to complete more than 750,000 daily rides in the country while Uber claims to offer around 200,000 rides. Ola has set an ambitious target of reaching one million drivers on its platform in three years. Currently, it has over 100,000 drivers, a number that has grown from 10,000 a year ago. Didi Kuaidi was formed after China’s largest taxi-hailing firms – Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache – merged in February this year. Till date Didi Kuaidi has raised $4.4 billion in seven rounds of funding from marquee investors such as Alibaba, Temasek Holdings, Tencent Holdings and others.As Online Data Theft Escalates, Banks Look to Retailers to Bear the Losses On Sept. 1 last year, the website Rescator, known as the “Amazon.com of the black market,” alerted its customers that huge quantities of stolen debit and credit card data would go on sale the next day. “Load your accounts and prepare for an avalanche of cash!” the website urged. The next day, two batches of cardholder data were reportedly sold, according to legal documents. The website claimed the cards were 100 percent valid and working. Demand was so high that the website temporarily crashed. Over the next few days, several more batches of card data were sold. On Sept. 8, Home Depot issued a news release admitting its data systems had been breached. By then, the damage had been done. Approximately 56 million sets of card data had been stolen, some of which were sold on the black market and remained valid for several days. At a small credit union in California, fraudulent charges of more than $100,000 were posted in just three minutes after the card information was sold on the black market. A bank reported $300,000 in suspicious charges in two hours to the security blog Krebs on Security, which connected Home Depot with the stolen cards before the retailer did. A year later, the full tally of the Home Depot data breach remains unknown. Some estimate the fraudulent charges total well into the billions of dollars. Over the last couple of years, retailing has been a rich hunting ground for online criminals. They hacked into numerous companies, including Neiman Marcus, Sally Beauty and the crafts store Michaels. But the orchestrated theft at Target in late 2013, followed a few months later by the Home Depot data breach, eclipsed all of the others. So far, there have been no arrests in the Target and Home Depot breaches. As the size and scope of such attacks at retailers has grown, so have the losses, which have been largely shouldered by financial institutions. Now some small banks and others want Home Depot and those companies that suffer data breaches to pay.Google Virtual-Reality System Aims to Enliven As Tech Majors Eye Education: As part of a class last year on “Romeo and Juliet,” Jennie Choi, an English teacher at Mariano Azuela Elementary School in Chicago, took her sixth-grade students on a tour of Verona, the Italian city where Shakespeare’s play transpires. During the excursion, Ms. Choi asked her class to examine the variegated facade of a centuries-old building, known on tourist maps as “Juliet’s House,” where the family that may have been the inspiration for the fictional heroine once lived. She also encouraged her sixth graders to scrutinize the deteriorated tomb where they could imagine the Juliet character had died. But the students did not have to leave their Chicago classroom to take in the play’s Italian backdrop. Instead, as part of a pilot project for a new Google virtual field trip system for schools, Ms. Choi’s students tried out virtual-reality viewers — composed of cardboard and a cellphone — while their teacher used an app to guide them through stereoscopic vistas of the Italian town. The introduction of Google’s virtual-reality kits for classrooms highlights the growing importance of the education sector to major technology companies — and the mounting competition among them. In 2006, for instance, Google introduced Apps for Education, a bundle of cloud-based email, calendar and document-sharing products available free to schools. Now, 45 million students and teachers around the world use the apps, the company said. Microsoft has also developed a substantial school audience for its email, search, calendar, Skype and other software. This month, Microsoft introduced several new products for education customers, including a note-taking app called OneNote Class Notebook. But the advent of Google Expeditions is also indicative of an industry strategy shift. Some leading tech companies have recently made a decision to focus on designing products specifically for classroom use, rather than simply modifying their existing consumer or enterprise products and then marketing them to schools. Last year, Google introduced Classroom, a free app that teachers can use to create, collect and comment on student assignments. This month, Facebook announced that company engineers were working with Summit Public Schools in California on software to customize learning to individual students. Google engineers similarly worked with teachers to develop virtual-reality field trips based on course curriculumsAcademia Pushes A New Kind of Peer Review For Research With ‘Sessions’: For several years, Richard Price has had a quixotic dream to make cutting-edge academic research universally available to everyone. “I want a world where a 19-year-old kid in China can access a paper he’s interested in about lithium ion batteries on his phone on the subway and it’s validated by others and it’s in his own language,” Price said. Price has amassed 25 million users on his platform, Academia, which disseminates and validates research papers. Now he’s trying to take it to the next level with a feature called Sessions, which is a form of peer review that exists entirely online on Academia. “If you speak to academics, they will complain about the publishing system,” he said. “It can take 12 months to get the peer review done. Our grand vision for the publishing experience is that an academic should be able to get work published in 24 hours that is already peer reviewed by two people.” Academia has been trialling ‘Sessions’ with a select number of members but now it’s fully rolled out, with as many as 6,000 sessions going on simultaneously every day. Sessions allows select groups of academics to privately discuss a working paper for 20 days. It tries to mimic the dynamics of a conference where a researcher discusses their work with a select peer group in a question-and-answer session. Price said that there were a couple of features that were absolutely necessary to make this work. One is that it’s private, so that comments are not searchable on Google and academics have the ability to respond to critics personally before they revise their work. The other is that it’s not just a comment box at the bottom of PDF. Sessions’ comments are on the right-hand bar of the page and they are annotations that refer to specific sentences of paragraphs (kind of like Medium’s commenting format). There is also a time limit of 20 days so that there’s pressure for other academics to respond quickly. Lastly, Academia is its own distribution network and it can pull in other relevant researchers to comment on a person’s paper. Instead of cold-calling or e-mailing dozens of people, an academic can reach out to other researchers who have high author or paper rankings. Conceptually, Academia’s Paper Rank is comparable to Google’s Page Rank with citations and linking built in as a form of validation. The company, which has 26 employees, has raised around $18 million from investors including Khosla, Spark Capital and True Ventures.India Replaces China as Next Big Frontier for U.S. Tech Companies: Two years ago, India’s rise as a digital nation was hard to imagine. Internet penetration was modest, mobile phone networks were glacially slow, and smartphones were a blip in a sea of basic phones. Since 2013, however, the number of smartphone users in India has ballooned and will reach 168 million this year, the research firm eMarketer predicts, with 277 million Internet users in India expected over all. India already conducts more mobile searches on Google than any country besides the United States. Yet “we are barely scratching the surface of availability of Internet to the masses,” said Amit Singhal, Google’s senior vice president in charge of search, who emigrated from India to the United States 25 years ago.  India and its 1.25 billion residents have become the hottest growth opportunity — the new China — for American Internet companies. Blocked from China itself or frustrated by the onerous demands of its government, companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter, as well as start-ups and investors, see India as the next best thing. The increasing appeal of India, now the world’s fastest growing major economy, was underscored in recent days. During a meeting in Seattle on Wednesday with American technology executives, China’s president, Xi Jinping, was unwavering on his government’s tough Internet policies. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, on the other hand, was on a charm offensive during his own American tour. After a stop in New York City, he headed to Silicon Valley, where he visited Tesla and attended a dinner with tech chieftains like Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sundar Pichai of Google. On Sunday, Mr. Modi participated in a town hall discussion with Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive. He also planned to drop by Google and Stanford University, mingle with entrepreneurs and address a sold-out arena of 18,000 people in San Jose, Calif., before heading back to New York to meet with President Obama on Monday. ”For India to keep making progress, it needs to be a leader online,” Mr. Modi said during the Facebook event. He acknowledged that tech companies like Facebook were not connecting people out of pure altruism, but he told Mr. Zuckerberg, “I hope this will not just be something to enhance your company’s bank balance.” The overall message to Silicon Valley from Mr. Modi, who posts regularly on Twitter and Facebook: Help India become an Internet powerhouse.Coming Soon to Checkouts: Microchip-Card Payment Systems: Starting next month, retailers that haven’t upgraded their payment systems to read E.M.V. microchips — the small, metallic rectangles that are increasingly prevalent on the front of American charge cards — will bear the financial liability for some fraudulent charges. (Gas stations have an extra two years to make the switch for charges from their fuel pumps.) E.M.V. stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa, the companies that created the standard in the mid-1990s. The new technology is a significant change from the current system, under which card issuers absorb most of the losses for in-person transactions made with counterfeit or stolen cards. Banks and merchants lost an estimated $16.3 billion last year globally on fraudulent transactions, and America has been their biggest problem spot. The country accounts for nearly half of the global losses, despite generating only 21 percent of the worldwide transaction volume, according to the Nilson Report, an industry researcher.Visa drew a line in the sand four years ago: American merchants would have until October 2015 to update their systems or absorb the losses themselves. Other major card networks quickly adopted the same deadline. Just days before the deadline, few merchants are ready. A handful of national retailers — most prominently, Walmart and Target — have invested in E.M.V.-ready terminals and spoken publicly about the switch, but many others have stayed silent. Around 27 percent of American merchants will be ready to process E.M.V. cards next month, according to a survey conducted this month by the Strawhecker Group, a consulting firm for the payments industry. For small sellers, the readiness rate is even lower. Banks and industry groups estimate that one in five will have their new systems running by Oct. 1. Both systems will continue to be available during a lengthy transition period.SoftBank Drops on Decline in Alibaba Stake’s Market Value: SoftBank Group Corp. dropped to the lowest in two years as the market values of its biggest U.S. holdings, Alibaba and Sprint, plunged. Billionaire Masayoshi Son’s mobile carrier and Internet investment company fell as much as 6.9 percent to 5,835 yen, the lowest since July 2013. The slump came on the first Japanese trading day after the lockup on Alibaba shares was lifted one year after its initial public offering.SoftBank has more than 1,000 investments, and its three biggest shareholdings of Alibaba, Sprint and Yahoo Japan Corp. have dropped by 700 billion yen ($5.8 billion) over the past 10 days to 8.7 trillion yen. Japan’s third-largest wireless carrier also slumped with rivals on concerns that revenue may weaken after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the nation’s mobile-phone rates were too high. Alibaba fell for a fifth day Wednesday in New York, slumping to as low as $59.68, compared with its IPO price of $68.Pandora says has paid $500 million in artist royalties in past year: Internet radio service Pandora Media Inc said it paid nearly $500 million in artist royalties over the past 12 months, bringing the total to more than $1.5 billion in about 10 years. \"It took us nearly nine years to generate the first billion dollars in royalties, and just over a year to increase that total by 50 percent,\" Chief Executive Brian McAndrews said in a statement on Wednesday. Pandora gets revenue from advertising and paid subscriptions.The Risk of a Billion-Dollar Valuation in Silicon Valley: Deep inside a Silicon Valley unicorn lurks a time bomb. It is a peculiarity of venture capital financing that the engine that pumps money into a promising start-up can later cause the same start-up to self-destruct. With all the hoopla and debate over sky-high valuations of technology start-ups, it is worth keeping in mind that the switch that helps to drive those surging valuations can also be turned off. The “bomb,” so to speak, is known as a liquidation preference. In every financing round, the money that a venture capital firm invests is not given freely. The firm and the start-up will negotiate terms of protection. Negotiable terms include voting rights, seats on the start-up’s board and assurances that a future fund-raising won’t unduly dilute the venture capital firms’ stake. The liquidation preference is among the most important of these protections. This feature provides that the venture capital firm’s investment will be repaid before the founders and employees are rewarded. If the firm has particular leverage, it can negotiate an even more protective form, known as the senior liquidation preference, which provides that the firm will be paid not only before the common stockholders but also before anyone else who bought preferred stock in earlier rounds. These provisions apply in a sale but not in an initial public offering of stock. The idea is to ensure that even if the investment does not perform well, the venture investor will still get back its initial money. According to a recent survey by the law firm Fenwick & West of 37 unicorns — private companies with valuations of $1 billion or more — every investment had a liquidation preference. Higher valuations create higher expectations, and failure to meet them can set off a downward spiral and a forced sale. In that event, the venture capitalists are paid first, leaving “unicorpses” in their wake and the founders with nothing. And don’t expect I.P.O.s to save these companies. Some unicorns, like Honest Company, have terms that require minimum I.P.O. prices for the V.C. investors that they just won’t be able to meet anytime soon. As these valuations go up and down, remember that reaching a $1 billion valuation is not all good news for a start-up. Instead, it can simply mean that the newly foaled unicorn has made a Faustian bargain.The tech behind how Volkswagen tricked emissions tests: Volkswagen isn’t hiding from its emissions cheating scandal, which the company now says affects some 11 million diesel cars worldwide. “Let’s be clear about this: Our company was dishonest with the EPA and the California Air Resources Board and with all of you,” Volkswagen U.S. chief Michael Horn said Monday night. “In my German words, we have totally screwed up.” Thanks for finally coming clean, VW. But how exactly did the technology behind Volkswagen’s so-called defeat device actually work? Regulators allege that Volkswagen installed software into its cars that allowed the autos to circumvent EPA tests. But that still doesn’t explain how VW vehicles were able to determine when they were being subjected to an emissions test in the first place. To understand more about how Volkswagen cheated, we have to know a bit about the EPA’s testing process. When carmakers test their vehicles against EPA standards, they place a car on rollers and then perform a series of specific maneuvers prescribed by federal regulations. Among the most common tests for passenger cars is the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), which simulates 7.5 miles of urban driving. In the first 505 seconds of the test, the driver pushes the car to highway-level speeds. The second phase of the test looks more like what you’d see in stop-and-go city traffic. In all these tests, the driver has to stay within two miles per hour of the required speed at any given moment. Along the way, the testers collect emissions data. There's a dizzying array of other tests that cars sometimes face. There’s a test to simulate aggressive driving, which tops out at some 80 miles an hour, and a test that simulates urban driving on a hot summer day, with the air conditioning on full blast. There’s a cold-start test, where you begin the test with everything in the car turned off. There’s a hot-start test. There’s something called a New York City cycle, which simulates driving in a busy downtown area where you never get above 30 mph. And then there’s the Federal Test Procedure, a 30-minute test that mixes various elements of the other tests. In the end, the detailed requirements for each test gave Volkswagen the advance knowledge it needed to teach its cars when to behave more cleanly. By measuring how long the engine was running, the vehicle’s speeds, and even seemingly esoteric factors, such as the position of the steering wheel and barometric pressure, Volkswagen vehicles could understand they were being tested and so adjusted their engine performance to pass the tests, according to the EPA. Using a special engine setting for vehicle tests isn’t all that unusual, according to Consumer Reports. Most new vehicles do something similar because otherwise vehicles might interpret some of the testing procedures, like traction issues from being on rollers, as dangerous. But the problem here is that the EPA says the carmaker used its testing mode in an inappropriate attempt to beat the system.Quirky, an Invention Start-Up, Files for Bankruptcy:  Quirky, an ambitious crowdsourced invention start-up, which raised $185 million from investors that included General Electric and leading venture capital firms, filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday. The failure of the company, based in New York, will surely raise questions about how far the crowd-based model of innovation and product development, made possible by the Internet, can go. Other companies are using crowdsourcing to make physical goods, from Threadless for T-shirt designs to Local Motors for automobiles. None, though, were doing it as broadly and across as wide a range of products as Quirky. The company said on Tuesday that it was seeking protection from its creditors while it arranged a sale of “substantially all its assets.” Quirky said that it already had an initial bid of $15 million for its Wink subsidiary, which was created last year. Wink makes software so that an array of Internet-connected home devices, as varied as thermostats and door locks, can be controlled from a smartphone app. Quirky had some success, with revenue rising sharply last year to about $100 million. But the scale of its ambitions — managing a sprawling community of inventors, transforming raw ideas into product designs, and orchestrating manufacturing and distribution — proved daunting and too costly.The Plot Twist: E-Book Sales Slip and Print Is Far From Dead: Five years ago, the book world was seized by collective panic over the uncertain future of print. As readers migrated to new digital devices, e-book sales soared, up 1,260 percent between 2008 and 2010, alarming booksellers that watched consumers use their stores to find titles they would later buy online. Print sales dwindled, bookstores struggled to stay open, and publishers and authors feared that cheaper e-books would cannibalize their business. Then in 2011, the industry’s fears were realized when Borders declared bankruptcy. Now, there are signs that some e-book adopters are returning to print, or becoming hybrid readers, who juggle devices and paper. E-book sales fell by 10 percent in the first five months of this year, according to the Association of American Publishers, which collects data from nearly 1,200 publishers. Digital books accounted last year for around 20 percent of the market, roughly the same as they did a few years ago. E-books’ declining popularity may signal that publishing, while not immune to technological upheaval, will weather the tidal wave of digital technology better than other forms of media, like music and television. E-book subscription services, modeled on companies like Netflix and Pandora, have struggled to convert book lovers into digital binge readers, and some have shut down. Sales of dedicated e-reading devices have plunged as consumers migrated to tablets and smartphones. And according to some surveys, young readers who are digital natives still prefer reading on paper. The surprising resilience of print has provided a lift to many booksellers. Independent bookstores, which were battered by the recession and competition from Amazon, are showing strong signs of resurgence. The American Booksellers Association counted 1,712 member stores in 2,227 locations in 2015, up from 1,410 in 1,660 locations five years ago.Payments Businesses Are Damn Hard: The Cover App Edition: Cover, a young payments app, is accepted in 350 restaurants in four cities. It has processed more than $10 million in transactions since the beginning of the year. But it will record, at most, just $150,000 in revenue in 2015 after passing on a big cut of its fees to other financial institutions, its founder says. So go the economics of a young payments business. And so ends Cover’s life as a stand-alone company. Founder Mark Egerman said today that his startup has sold to European competitor Velocity in a small deal, after passing on taking on more venture capital under less-than-great terms. “Payments is really a hard business,” Egerman said flatly. Cover allows diners to pay for a meal by pressing a few buttons in a smartphone app at partnering restaurants instead of handing over a credit card or cash. The company generates revenue by charging restaurants 3 percent of the price of each meal. But, like many payment processing businesses, Cover passes along about two-thirds of that fee to banks and other financial institutions behind the scenes. So on a $100 meal, Cover’s cut is $3, but it only keeps $1 for itself. Then it has to pay for all of its expenses. If that doesn’t sound sustainable for a small, venture-backed company, that’s because it’s not. (Cover has raised about $7 million.) Cover’s fate underscores how hard it is to build sustainable payment-processing businesses without enormous transaction volume, and why even much bigger payments startups such as Square and Stripe are diversifying their product offerings to beef up profit margins and create new e-commerce markets. Square processes more than $30 billion in brick-and-mortar transactions each year, charging merchants a 2.75 percent fee for each transaction. Like Cover, it passes on about two-thirds of that fee to other financial players in the payments ecosystem, including banks and credit card companies. To supplement this business as it readies for an IPO and to live up to its $6 billion valuation, the company has unveiled a host of products to create new revenue streams with better profit margins. Its cash-advance business, Square Capital, was doling out $1 million a day as of August. It is also selling software products to merchants through monthly subscriptions — another avenue to move past the minor margins of the payments business. Stripe, the online payments company, has said it processes billions of dollars in payments, but it already has a $5 billion valuation. Its one and only revenue source is still the 2.9 percent cut it takes of most transactions, plus a flat 30-cent fee. It, too, is looking for new areas of growth from new types of commerce.Groupon to Cut About 1,100 Jobs Worldwide:  Groupon, operator of a daily deals website, said it would cut about 1,100 jobs globally as it restructures outside North America. Groupon is shutting operations in Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay after exiting Greece and Turkey, the company said in a separate blog post on Tuesday. Groupon, which had about 11,800 employees globally at the end of December, said that it expected to complete the job cuts, mainly in sales and customer service, by September 2016. A strong dollar has hurt companies with a large presence in markets outside the United States. Markets outside North America accounted for about 43 percent of Groupon’s revenue in 2014. The company said in April it would sell a 46 percent stake in its South Korean business as part of its turnaround efforts. “I think it’s actually a good thing for investors to hear that they’re taking some more cuts out of their international operations,” Topeka Capital Markets analyst Blake Harper said. Groupon, once the leader in the online coupons market, has also been struggling to boost sales as competitive deals on online marketplaces operated by Amazon and eBay make its coupons less attractive to shoppers. The company has started selling products on its website. Groupon said it expected to incur pretax charges of up to $35 million, including $22 million-$24 million in the third quarter, related to the job cuts.Uber’s Carpool Version, UberPool, Lands in India Before Palo Alto: Uber’s taking UberPool global, testing it soon in Bangalore, India. This is one of the first times the company has offered its carpooling version in another country (it’s also in France). Funnily enough, India will have access to UberPool before many suburban Uber markets in the United States like Palo Alto and San Jose. It’s possible the company plans to focus UberPool in dense cities, where it’s more likely to find matches between passengers heading the same way, instead of sprawling suburbs. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said recently at the Salesforce conference that UberPool isn’t as profitable as its original UberX service. UberPool in India might face some major challenges. GPS and mapping tools are a different beast in the South Asian country, where the city landscape changes daily, roads start and stop in unexpected places and businesses launch and disappear unexpectedly. With a population of 4.3 million — by comparison, San Francisco is at 1 million — Bangalore is known for major traffic issues. UberPool requires picking up people from different destinations quickly and efficiently so carpooling doesn’t add too much more time to a person’s commute. It’s a tough enough problem in the U.S.; navigating the maze of streets and traffic in India might be even harder. Uber will also be taking on its competitors — sources tell Re/code that Ola Cabs is launching its carpool version, Ola Share, in five cities soon. Long distance travel app BlaBlaCar, which offers a more traditional form of carpooling, is already live in India.Kickstarter Focuses Its Mission on Altruism Over Profit: Many technology start-ups aim to become “unicorns,” the companies that get valued at $1 billion or more on their way to probable vast riches. Yancey Strickler and Perry Chen have no interest in that. As co-founders of Kickstarter, the popular online crowdfunding website that lets people raise money to help fund all manner of projects, including cooking gadgets and movies, Mr. Strickler and Mr. Chen could have tried to take their company public or sell it, earning millions of dollars for themselves and other shareholders. Instead, they announced on Sunday that Kickstarter was reincorporating as a “public benefit corporation,” a legal change they said would ensure that money — or the promise of it — would not corrupt their company’s mission of enabling creative projects to be funded. Public benefit corporations are a relatively new designation that has been signed into law by a number of states. Delaware, where Kickstarter is reincorporating, began allowing public benefit corporations in 2013. Under the designation, companies must aim to do something that would aid the public (such as Kickstarter’s mission to “help bring creative projects to life”) and include that goal in their corporate charter. Board members must also take that public benefit into account when making decisions, and the company has to report on its social impact. Kickstarter’s move builds upon its decision last year to become a B Corporation, a voluntary designation certified by a nonprofit group called B Lab. To become a B Corp, companies must meet rigorous environmental and social-responsibility standards, which they report annually to shareholders — though taking on the status has no legal impact. Other companies, including the e-commerce site Etsy, which went public in April, and Warby Parker, the eyeglasses retailer, have also opted to become B Corps.China cyber espionage is more than an irritant, must stop: U.S. U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice on Monday issued a stern warning to China before President Xi Jinping's visit that state-sponsored cyber espionage must stop, calling it a national security concern and critical factor in U.S.-China relations. \"This isn't a mild irritation, it's an economic and national security concern to the United States,\" she said during remarks at George Washington University. \"It puts enormous strain on our bilateral relationship, and it is a critical factor in determining the future trajectory of U.S.-China ties.\" President Barack Obama and Xi are expected to have an intense back-and-forth about the issue when the Chinese leader comes to the White House this week. \"Cyber-enabled espionage that targets personal and corporate information for the economic gain of businesses undermines our long-term economic cooperation and it needs to stop,\" Rice said.Zumper: One-Third Of San Francisco’s Rent Is Attributable To VC Funding: Zumper, a venture-backed startup that focuses on creating a more efficient and transparent apartment rental marketplace, ran a study of housing costs in tech hubs across the United States. They’re arguing that one-third of San Francisco’s rents are attributable to venture capital funding. Last year, venture firms invested $49 billion across the United States. The vast majority of it, or 78 percent, went to just 10 American cities. The company looked at 3 million active listings across the United States last year. The study, done by the company’s housing economist and MBA student Andrew Duboff, isolated for factors including population, median household income, median home values, rental housing vacancy rates, and impact of local rent control ordinances. The Zumper study did not account for zoning regulations. “It was tough to isolate an apples-to-apples comparison for zoning regulations, so we ended up not including it,” said Devin O’Brien, who heads up marketing for Zumper. “That being said, vacancy rates does include a lot of this as a secondary measure. However, at the end of the day, we had an adjusted R-squared correlation of 0.83 for venture capital investment. It’s very strong.” Another study last year from UC Berkeley economics professor Enrico Moretti and University of Chicago’s Chang-Tai Hsieh argued zoning regulations are incredibly costly to the American economy. They found that if highly-productive cities like New York City, Boston and San Francisco had a more elastic housing supply, it could add 9.5 percent to the U.S. GDP.Apple's iOS App Store suffers first major attack: Apple said on Sunday it is cleaning up its iOS App Store to remove malicious iPhone and iPad programs identified in the first large-scale attack on the popular mobile software outlet. The company disclosed the effort after several cyber security firms reported finding a malicious program dubbed XcodeGhost that was embedded in hundreds of legitimate apps. It is the first reported case of large numbers of malicious software programs making their way past Apple's stringent app review process. Prior to this attack, a total of just five malicious apps had ever been found in the App Store. The hackers embedded the malicious code in these apps by convincing developers of legitimate software to use a tainted, counterfeit version of Apple's software for creating iOS and Mac apps, which is known as Xcode, Apple said. Palo Alto Networks Director of Threat Intelligence Ryan Olson said the malware had limited functionality and his firm had uncovered no examples of data theft or other harm as a result of the attack. Still, he said it was \"a pretty big deal\" because it showed that the App Store could be compromised if hackers infected machines of software developers writing legitimate apps. Other attackers may copy that approach, which is hard to defend against, he said. Researchers said infected apps included Tencent's popular mobile chat app WeChat, car-hailing app Didi Kuaidi and a music app from Internet portal NetEase. The tainted version of Xcode was downloaded from a server in China that developers may have used because it allowed for faster downloads than using Apple's U.S. servers, Olson said.Cheap robots may shift car making from China to U.S.: Magna CEO. The falling cost of intelligent robots may help repatriate some car manufacturing work away from low-cost locations like China back to factories in Germany and North America, Donald Walker, Chief Executive of auto supplier Magna told Reuters. Rising wages in China and the cost of importing heavy components like electric car batteries into Europe may lead established car makers to introduce more highly efficient automated manufacturing closer to home, Walker told Reuters in an interview at the Frankfurt auto show. \"If you have a high labor, easy-to-ship part, it has already gone, for the most part, to a low-cost jurisdiction,\" Walker said about the evolution of assembly work in the car manufacturing business. \"A bigger issue is how fast do you have intelligent robotics replace manual labor everywhere in the world,\" Walker said. By 2025 the total cost of manufacturing labor is projected to fall between 18 and 33 percent in countries which already deploy industrial robots, including South Korea, China, the U.S. Germany and Japan, a study on advanced manufacturing technologies by the Boston Consulting Group showed.Gentex transforms rear-view mirror into high-tech vision system: Gentex Corp is broadening its role from a traditional Michigan-based auto parts maker to a supplier of high-tech vision systems that eventually could be integrated into self-driving cars. General Motors Co will be the first automaker to use a new rear-view mirror developed by Gentex, on the 2016 Cadillac CT6 sedan. The car goes on sale early next year and the mirror will be offered at extra cost. At the flip of a switch, the full display mirror converts into a video display that provides a panoramic view behind the vehicle. Called the Gentex Full Display Mirror, it incorporates a rear camera and software that transforms a prosaic piece of hardware into a platform for more advanced safety technology, marketing director Craig Piersma said. While relatively young tech-focused suppliers such as Mobileye NV have become investor favorites as the auto industry ramps up development of advanced driver assistance systems - the building blocks for future self-driving cars - Gentex has quietly been turning out 30 million rear-view mirrors a year. Founded in 1974, Gentex is one of the world's largest suppliers of auto-dimming automotive mirrors, but it also has steadily beefed up its capability as an electronics manufacturer, expanding its expertise in cameras and displays. Among its products is the camera-based SmartBeam system that automatically switches headlamps from high to low beam. It also provides collision and lane departure warnings and vehicle and pedestrian detection.As Search Matures, Baidu Tries to Move Offline: Baidu is spending an estimated $2.5 billion on e-commerce projects this year as its profits dwindle. Baidu runs China’s primary search engine, but with the PC search business maturing and the economy slowing, Chairman Robin Li has been looking to diversify. In the past two years, he’s pushed Baidu deeper into the kinds of e-commerce businesses dominated by China’s other two big Internet companies, Alibaba and Tencent. During that time, Baidu’s invested almost $1 billion in more than a dozen websites and apps specializing in everything from food delivery to laundry pickup, from booking a doctor’s appointment to reserving a slot at a karaoke club. The goal is “transforming the company from connecting people with information to connecting people with services,” says Li, who’s committing $3.1 billion more over the next three years to just one of Baidu’s investments, Groupon look-alike Nuomi.com. But as it commits more money to e-commerce expansion efforts, its profit margins have fallen by half since 2012, to 28 percent in its most recent quarter. So while Baidu is tapping its $12 billion in cash to widen its e-commerce footprint, it’s also trying to attract big-name partners. The company paid an undisclosed amount for a minority stake in Uber in December, and fast-food chain Ajisen announced in July that it’s investing $60 million in Baidu’s takeout service, which launched last year and has about 8 percent of China’s market. Borrowing from Amazon.com’s strategy, Li is also expanding Baidu’s entertainment offerings. Its video service, IQiyi, signed a deal with Paramount Pictures in July for local streaming rights to 800 of the studio’s titles, including the Transformers and Terminator series. Baidu has a ways to go before its new ventures pay for themselves. Investment bank Jefferies estimates that Baidu’s profit will fall more than 12 percent this year, to about $1.8 billion, while the company spends $2.5 billion on its e-commerce-centric expansion. Baidu’s Nasdaq-listed shares have dropped 28 percent in the past six months, and Li says he may consider delisting from the U.S. in favor of his home market. But, he says, “We need to be patient and give our U.S. investors some time. I hope they will be able to appreciate us more.”Alibaba's Wipeout Leaves Investors Questioning What Comes Next: Alibaba looked like a sure thing a year ago when it pulled off the largest initial public offering ever. It had a lock on China e-commerce as the economy was surging and consumer spending was steadily rising. Shares soared 76 percent from the IPO price in just two months. Then it all crumbled. Alibaba came under fire from a China government agency, it cut deals that baffled investors and it replaced its chief executive as growth slowed. Most important, China’s economy turned wobbly, jeopardizing the rise in consumer spending Alibaba needed. Its stock slid down, down, down to the IPO price and then below. The sure thing was no such thing. What now? Investors who watched $128 billion in market value disappear shouldn’t expect a reprieve any time soon. Atlantic Equities’s James Cordwell, the top-ranked analyst covering the stock, predicts the slowing Chinese economy will undercut e-commerce transaction growth until at least 2016. The many deals Alibaba has negotiated will take time to pay off too. “All the operating metrics seem to be pointing in the wrong direction,” said London-based Cordwell, who topped Bloomberg Absolute Return rankings for his calls on Alibaba and also recommendations across the portfolio he covers. “Until investors feel some comfort in that slowdown bottoming out, it will be hard for the stock.”Lyft Announces Deal With Didi Kuaidi, the Chinese Ride-Hailing Company: The pink mustache is coming to China. And it will receive a warm welcome — not a snub — from its new hosts. Lyft, the San Francisco-based ride-hailing start-up that has its drivers affix a striking pink mustache logo to their cars, announced a partnership with Didi Kuaidi, China’s pre-eminent ride-hailing company, that will allow the American company to operate in China for the first time. The cross-border deal will also let Didi Kuaidi operate in the United States. Lyft’s partnership with Didi Kuaidi offers a somewhat novel approach to international expansion. Didi Kuaidi, which comprises China’s two largest ride-hailing start-ups, will let Lyft users from the United States find rides in China using the Lyft app. Didi Kuaidi will fulfill those ride requests using its drivers, while Lyft users will not have to leave the app to download or sign up for any new services. Didi Kuaidi will have much the same agreement with Lyft for its users. Chinese users entering the United States can find a ride using the Didi Kuaidi app, with those rides being fulfilled by Lyft. The partnership between the two companies is perhaps the clearest sign yet of the race to conquer different parts of the world in the global ride-hailing industry. The handful of major companies in the business of providing car rides have raised giant sums of money — some into the billions of dollars — and are using the money to open in new markets and release new product offerings. Nearly all of these companies have their eye on Uber, the huge on-demand ride company that has raised more than $7 billion in venture capital and is valued at more than $50 billion. Over the last five years, Uber has exploded in growth to more than 300 cities across 60 countries. China, in particular, has recently been a hotbed of contention and competition for ride-hailing start-ups. Uber has earmarked more than $1 billion for its aggressive push into Asia — and particularly China — and is spending millions in subsidies to attract drivers and riders to its service with lucrative promotions. Still, Uber’s presence in China is dwarfed by that of Didi Kuaidi, which controls 80 percent of the overall ride-hailing market in China. Apple Acquires Mapsense, a Mapping Visualization Startup: Apple’s steady stealth campaign to rival Google in maps continues apace. This month, the company acquired Mapsense, a San Francisco startup that builds tools for analyzing and visualizing location data, according to multiple sources. Apple paid somewhere between $25 million and $30 million for the Mapsense 12-person team, which will now join the Cupertino company, according to two sources. “Apple buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,” the company said in a statement. Mapsense was formed in 2013 by Erez Cohen, a former engineer for the data science company Palantir Technologies. The company’s offering lets users slice and dice graphical models of maps that hold huge sums of data. It’s cloud-based, naturally. The company launched its developer platform in May, noting that it was welcoming customers from the financial sector, advertising, government and Fortune 500 firms. That same month, Mapsense raised $2.5 million in a seed round led by General Catalyst with other backers including Amplify.LA and Redpoint Ventures. Over the years, Apple has quietly scooped up several location-services companies, including HopStop, a crowd-sourced maps tool, in 2013 and Coherent Navigation, a GPS company, this past May.BlaBlaCar, a French Ride-Sharing Start-Up, Is Valued at $1.6 Billion: BlaBlaCar, the French ride-hailing start-up, announced on Wednesday that it had raised $200 million, primarily from United States investors, which valued the company at $1.6 billion. The funding comes as the Paris-based company, which was founded in 2006 and aims to connect people who want to split the cost of long-distance journeys, has expanded beyond its European roots into a growing number of emerging markets like Turkey, India and Russia. With roughly 20 million users spread across three continents, BlaBlaCar is hoping to follow in the footsteps of other on-demand services like Uber, the ride-booking company, and Airbnb, the vacation rental website, to expand its international operations. BlaBlaCar has so far mostly skirted controversy, unlike companies like Uber, which has faced protests from many regulators and taxi associations. That is because BlaBlaCar does not allow drivers to profit from the ride-sharing service. People can only split the cost of long-distance travel, say between Paris and Marseilles or Moscow and St. Petersburg. The French start-up says the average ride in Europe costs roughly $25 per person, significantly less than the region’s costly high-speed trains. The funding comes as the Paris-based company, which was founded in 2006 and aims to connect people who want to split the cost of long-distance journeys, has expanded beyond its European roots into a growing number of emerging markets like Turkey, India and Russia.Hewlett-Packard to Cut About 30,000 Jobs, About 10 Percent of Work Force: About 10 percent of the jobs at the current HP, or perhaps 30,000 of its 300,000 employees, will be eliminated, company officials said. “We’re looking forward to operating as two industry-leading companies,” said Ms. Whitman, HP’s chief executive, speaking at a meeting of financial analysts. “You’ll see us doing more pruning of businesses that don’t fit.” Ms. Whitman became the head of HP in 2011. As part of a restructuring announced in 2012, 54,000 jobs have been cut at the company. The new cuts are on top of that. In November, Ms. Whitman will become the chief executive of HP Enterprise, or HPE, which will sell things like computer servers, data storage, software and services to business. The other company, called HP Inc., will focus on printers and personal computers. Ms. Whitman has said the division will enable both businesses to react faster to changing markets. The big job cuts will come from HP Enterprise, in particular jobs at call centers and other service centers in developed countries. HP plans to automate many of the jobs, and build out positions in countries like India and Costa Rica. The services business had been largely dependent on just a few customers, and in 2014 it lost important accounts.Salesforce Plans to Give Customers Amazon-Type Analytics: Salesforce.com was one of the early giants of the cloud-computing revolution. Now it wants to be at the center of two of the next big things — big data and so-called computational intelligence everywhere. Marc Benioff, the co-founder and chief executive of Salesforce, is expected to make its “Internet of Things Cloud” a centerpiece of the company’s customer conference in San Francisco this week. Mr. Benioff, who has been skilled at predicting and positioning his company on major tech trends, sometimes with mixed success, hopes he can give nontechnical companies automated customer service and recommendations, the kind of activities done by computing-intensive companies like Amazon. If successful, Salesforce’s Internet of Things could vastly increase the amount of personalization we now see in many products and services. It could also justify the company’s highflying stock price, by making it much more attractive to its own customers. The Internet of Things is a term for online data from machines about their behavior. This service would combine data from devices like sensors and smartphones with customer information already inside Salesforce, like personal profiles and previous transactions. In one example from Salesforce, an insurance company would get data from a car’s bumpers and airbag indicating a collision, and could then send to its customer’s phone messages about current coverage, nearby tow trucks and service centers. Salesforce hopes to bring that capability to thousands of companies, which work with millions of customers. Nothing like that has been done before, let alone in a way that people skilled only in basic spreadsheets could manage. That means Salesforce has to build a powerful sorting and computing technology, and a series of customizable templates that can be easily used in a lot of different businesses. No major company has successfully done that.Indian cab-hailing firm Ola is raising $500 million+, at a valuation that we’ve heard is around the $5 billion mark, with $225 million committed so far. The news comes as the company — which competes in its home market against the likes of Uber and Indian startup Meru — continues to expand into more cities, and more products. Today, Ola launched a new car leasing service for drivers on its network; last week it expanded to shuttle services for commuters. The raise is due to be finalised in the next week or two and announced officially then, sources tell TechCrunch. As it is still in progress, the final amount and final valuation may also change. This funding, a Series F, has been rumored for some time now, with the first reports surfacing just after Ola announced its last raise of $400 million in April of this year. That round, a Series E, valued the company at $2.5 billion.Russian Authorities Rule Google Broke Antitrust Regulations:  Russian antitrust authorities ruled on Monday that Google broke the country’s competition rules, adding to the regulatory headaches the search giant is facing worldwide. Russian officials said that Google had abused its dominant market position with Android, its mobile operating system, by favoring the company’s own services over those of rivals, including Yandex, a Russian competitor. Earlier this year, Yandex had complained to the country’s competition authority that cellphone manufacturers were not able to include the company’s rival digital offerings in the Android operating system. After the complaint, the regulator began investigating whether Google unfairly bundled its own services, like digital maps, in its Android software. Unlike in other parts of the world, where Google has outmuscled domestic search rivals, Yandex still holds more than a 50 percent market share in Russian online search, according to industry statistics. The company’s share price rose more than 8 percent in early afternoon trading in New York after the regulatory decision was announced. “Russia is the first jurisdiction to have officially recognized these practices as anticompetitive,” Yandex said in a statement, in reference to Google’s favoring of its own services in Android over those of rivals. The company added that it believed the antitrust ruling would “serve to restore competition in the market.” European and other international antitrust watchdogs are taking an increasingly tough line against the company.The auto and tech worlds are fighting for the best minds in race for self-driving car: Google had all of Silicon Valley to choose from when deciding on a leader for its ambitious self-driving car division. Instead, the tech behemoth hired an auto-industry lifer: John Krafcik, a former head of Hyundai's American brand who got his start as an engineer working on the Ford Explorer. The announcement on Monday comes just a week after Toyota said it, too, had looked outside its industry for its next big name. Earlier this month, the carmaker said it had tapped the military’s chief robotics engineer, Gill Pratt, to lead a $50 million push into not just driverless cars but artificial intelligence, through investments into tech research labs. The high-profile hires spotlight the growing overlap between the global giants of autos and tech, and analysts say it could point to a growing tension between some of the industries' biggest, wealthiest names. Tech giants increasingly see ways to make money and save lives in the old-fashioned, hyper-profitable business of cars. But traditional automakers, who could lose heavily if self-driving cars go mainstream, aren't hesitating to grab onto some of tech's top minds, either, as a way to adapt in a world beyond cars.Alibaba Falls After Barron's Suggests Drop, Company Rebuts Alibaba shares fell Monday, the first day of trading since a Barron’s magazine article on Saturday suggested the Chinese Internet company may lose another 50 percent of its value. The company, in a statement posted Monday on its website, said the article was inaccurate and misleading. Barron’s based its conclusion that the Chinese company is overvalued, in part, by comparing Alibaba’s share price as a multiple of earnings estimates with EBay. Alibaba said the comparison is unfair because EBay’s online marketplace doesn’t do significant business in China.

Now, with public markets on a see-saw and venture capitalists thinking the turmoil may hit private markets, many investors are wondering if more Homejoys lie ahead. That is leading them to look extra hard at companies that hold similar characteristics to Homejoy: on-demand, logistics-heavy businesses that cater to consumers rather than businesses. \"They are caught on a treadmill\" because to keep running requires more cash infusions, though often without an accompanying move to profitability, said Venky Ganesan, a venture capitalist at Menlo Ventures. He said he looked at about a half dozen such companies in the spring and early summer, passing on all of them, only to see all raise money elsewhere. While the failure of one start-up might not seem like much, Homejoy's folding attracted outsized interest because it had already raised more than $35 million from high-caliber firms. Most start-ups fail, of course, but they generally do it at earlier stages and lower cost to their backers. Homejoy is one of at least four high-profile collapses or retrenchments so far in 2015, counting those that raised at least as much cash, also from top firms. In recent years, among consumer-oriented tech companies, just one or two such start-ups have failed each year.

In the process, the two companies are establishing a novel business model with implications for other American technology firms looking to do business in China’s politically sensitive tech industry. The partnership, signed in July 2014, is between CloudFlare, a security company based in San Francisco, and Baidu, China’s equivalent of Google. Using a mixture of CloudFlare’s web traffic technology and Baidu’s network of data centers in China, the two created a service that enables websites to load more quickly across China’s border. The service, called Yunjiasu, began operating in December. It has a unified network that makes foreign sites more easily accessible in China, and allows Chinese sites to run in destinations outside the country. At the heart of the arrangement is an unusual structure known as a virtual joint venture. Under that arrangement, CloudFlare does not actually operate in China. Instead, CloudFlare cooperates primarily from afar as Baidu runs the business in China. Baidu and CloudFlare’s virtual joint venture relies on a principle generally considered anathema to foreign companies looking to do business with China: trust. CloudFlare transferred its intellectual property that is used to manage and speed up Internet traffic to Baidu and works closely with its engineers to run that technology on Baidu’s network in China. The two share revenue from the service. For CloudFlare, a five-year-old company that manages Internet traffic for millions of websites and makes browsing quicker and more secure, the central question was whether to transfer its intellectual property and give up local control or to forgo the vast business opportunities in China. Outside of the high-profile sites that Beijing sees as a threat and blocks — like Facebook and Twitter — are a huge number of businesses that suffer under China’s network inefficiencies. Those are the customers the service is targeting. And since the fast-lane service began operating, CloudFlare and Baidu said they have registered 450,000 businesses that account for 57 billion page views per month. Customers can try the service free, though CloudFlare and Baidu added supplemental security features and greater control over web traffic last month, both of which must be paid for. Matthew Prince, CloudFlare’s chief executive, said transferring the company’s intellectual property to Baidu enabled a deeper trust and a partnership. He added that the intellectual property is not the most critical part of the company. “We had much less apprehension about sharing our code, because we don’t think there’s any line of code we write that’s so clever that gives us a sustained advantage,” Mr. Prince said. “That comes from the network itself.”  Still, to be safe, Baidu and CloudFlare worked out a contract that gives each company control over crucial elements and would inflict penalties if either partner withdrew. For example, Baidu controls customer information within China, but CloudFlare owns the web address through which the entire operation works.EBay Revamps Seller-Rating System in Appeal to Merchants: EBay is overhauling its ratings system so that sellers aren’t penalized for late shipments beyond their control or for routine returns and exchanges, seeking to boost sales as an independent company. While the online marketplace has long relied on a five-star rating system and commentaries that lets merchants and buyers grade each other on transactions, sellers have long complained that these also make them vulnerable to customer angst over minor issues that are unavoidable or easily resolved. EBay’s seller rankings can make or break the merchants selling everything from sweaters to smartphones, because they influence how prominently products appear in search results and the likelihood that shoppers will conduct business with them. EBay is stepping up efforts to keep its sellers happy, following its split in July from the PayPal Holdings Inc. transactions business. \"Our relationship with our sellers needs to be improved,\" Jordan Sweetnam, EBay’s vice president of seller experience, said in an interview. \"These are the biggest changes we’ve made in years.\" The new rating system is more simple and objective, according to Sweetnam. Sellers won’t be penalized for late deliveries as long as they get orders to couriers on time, while returns or exchanges won’t affect ratings if they’re resolved and the customer is satisfied with the process.Lyft automatically opts you into receiving robocalls. That doesn’t sit well with the FCC. Lyft and First National Bank are on notice for violating federal telemarketing rules, regulators said Friday. The two companies allegedly required that their customers accept robocalls and automatic text messages as a condition of using their services — a no-no under the Federal Communications Commission's regulations. The rules are meant to prevent companies from coercing customers into consenting to robocalls. Although Lyft allows users to opt out of robocalls, doing so bars consumers from using the ridesharing service, the FCC said. If the two companies don't change their behavior, that could lead to more than a warning — fines or other legal action.Google Starts Rolling Out Android Pay to Challenge Apple: Google is starting to roll out Android Pay this week, seeking to catch up with Apple Pay and grab a chunk of the growing market for mobile payments. The Web company, which announced plans for the service in May, has signed up partners including Macy’s, Staples and Whole Foods Market, Pali Bhat, Google’s director of product management for the new feature, said in a blog post Thursday. Android Pay turns smartphones into digital wallets that store credit and debit cards, which can then be used in physical and virtual stores. The mobile-payments market is projected to top $142 billion by 2019, up from $67 billion this year, according to Forrester Research Inc. Android Pay users will be able to shop for goods in more than 1 million U.S. locations and in over 1,000 apps, according to Google, which competes with Apple Inc., PayPal Holdings Inc. and other rivals that have introduced digital wallets. Google is betting Android Pay will help its smartphones lure more consumers. Like Apple Pay is built into iPhones, Android Pay will be integrated into smartphones running Google’s mobile operating system. Google’s earlier effort, Google Wallet, has been reoriented to focus on sending and receiving money, the company said today. Android Pay is also is working on new features, including the ability to use loyalty cards and special offers.Uber’s China Foe Said to Join Alibaba, Tencent in Lyft Deal: Uber’s Chinese rival invested in U.S. ride-sharing service Lyft around the second quarter, according to people familiar with an investment that takes the battle with Uber abroad. Didi Kuaidi joined Alibaba and Tencent in the funding round between March and June, the people said, asking not to be named because the deal was private. Their joint investment was intended to fuel Didi Kuaidi’s expansion abroad and bankroll Uber’s U.S. competitor, the people said. Alibaba invested $25 million, one of the people said. Asia’s two largest Internet companies already back Didi Kuaidi, the leading Chinese car-hailing service formed in February from two competing apps. Uber and Didi Kuaidi are locked in a costly struggle in China, competing for market share with incentives and subsidies to lure drivers and passengers. Both are close to raising more than $4 billion combined from investors in their latest fundraising rounds, people familiar with the plans said previously. Alibaba had been part of a consortium that backed San Francisco-based Lyft, whose cars in the U.S. sport distinctive pink mustaches on their front. The service counts Carl Icahn among its investors and was valued in a March fundraising round at $2.5 billion. Uber, in contrast, was said to be valued at more than $40 billion in its last round.Apple Sells Bonds in Euros Extending Debt Binge to $55 Billion: Apple sold bonds in euros for the second time, increasing the amount the iPhone maker has raised in global debt offerings since 2013 to more than $55 billion. The 2 billion-euro ($2.3 billion) sale was split evenly between bonds maturing in eight years and 12 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple sold the longer-dated notes at 85 basis points more than benchmark rates. That compares with the 45 basis-point premium for securities maturing in 2026 that the company sold in its debut euro offering in November, the data show. Apple has sold bonds around the world to diversify funding as it works to return $200 billion to investors by March 2017 and expands its global retail network. While the cost of funding has increased since Apple’s debut euro sale, U.S. companies can still raise capital in the single currency at a 2.07 percentage-point average discount to borrowing in dollars, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  “It’s slightly more expensive than last year’s euro-bond sale, but you’re still paying less than 2 percent for 12 years,” said Geraud Charpin, a portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management in London. “It’s pretty cheap money. What else do you want to ask for?” Apple will use the proceeds from the bond sale for general corporate purposes, as well as to buy back shares, pay dividends, boost working capital and to fund capital expenditure, acquisitions and repayment of debt, according to the person.China says Apple unit underpaid $71 million in tax in 2013: A China unit of U.S. tech giant Apple underpaid taxes in 2013 by 452 million yuan ($71 million), according to a report from the country's finance ministry, which comes as China toughens its stance on tax payments by foreign firms. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) report, dated Sept. 9 but cited by official news agency Xinhua on Thursday, said Apple had already repaid the taxes as well as paying 65 million yuan in late fees. The investigation, however, underlines an increasingly hard stance being taken by Beijing against foreign firms underpaying taxes after authorities said in December they would crack down on the practice. The finance ministry report said the Apple subsidiary had understated its revenues by 8.8 billion yuan and its costs by 3.4 billion yuan. It had also overstated its profits by 5.4 billion yuan. China levied around $140 million in back taxes from Microsoft Corp at the end of last year.Ubers Are About To Start Carrying Their Own In-Car Magazine: Starting this week in NYC, you can grab a copy of Uber’s new in-car magazine, called “Arriving Now,” from the seat-back pockets. A new print publication isn’t exactly a revolutionary move (airlines have been rocking inflight magazines for a while), but Uber has an interesting opportunity here to test the content waters. At face value, it seems like kind of a funny move for them to get into the truly burgeoning print journalism market, but there are a ton of different directions that this could be taken. Uber is probably more interested here in testing out a content arm where they can push out cool stories that gives people a better “brand experience” with the company. Though most people probably spend their time on a phone in the back of an Uber regardless, seat-back, always-on touch screens could probably be coming soon enough to a car near you, allowing users more ways to interact with Uber’s continually growing on-demand services that don’t necessarily involve getting people from place-to-place.The Bloomberg Terminal, a Wall Street Fixture, Faces Upstarts:  For nearly three decades, the flickering orange-on-black screens of the Bloomberg terminal have been omnipresent on Wall Street trading floors and executive suite desks, maintaining a vital lifeline of data and communication. In knitting together the world of finance, those $21,000-a-year terminals have generated billions of dollars for Bloomberg, almost single-handedly paying for the company’s journalistic ambitions, as well as the fortune, political career and philanthropic largess of its founder, Michael R. Bloomberg. Now that golden egg — and all that it pays for — is a target for new competitors looking to knock it from its dominant position. Bloomberg has fended off competition before, but the latest upstarts are gunning for the company at a time when Wall Street is already aggressively looking to cut its spending on Bloomberg terminals. Later this month, a start-up called Symphony, created by Goldman Sachs and backed by the large banks, is introducing software that provides an alternative to what many traders say is the most valuable part of the Bloomberg terminal — the chat program used by traders and investors. At Goldman, more than half of the people who have Bloomberg terminals use them primarily for chat and other simple functions, according to people briefed on the subject who were not authorized to speak publicly. At the same time, Money.Net, a start-up that has been built by a former top Bloomberg executive, is looking to challenge Bloomberg head-on and is gaining momentum and stealing away customers. After more than a decade as New York’s mayor, Mr. Bloomberg has been retaking the reins of the company and pushing to refine its focus. Last week, dozens of Bloomberg journalists were laid off as part of a broader effort to reconfigure how journalism fits into the company. Bloomberg’s news offerings — including BusinessWeek and the company’s website — generate less than 4 percent of the company’s revenue and cost more than they earn, according to Burton-Taylor Consulting. The terminals generate 75 percent of Bloomberg’s revenue. All service providers for Wall Street, not just Bloomberg, are unusually vulnerable at the moment. The financial industry is in the middle of an aggressive run of cost-cutting as it grapples with new regulations and changes in the markets. A Bloomberg contract, which can be upward of $100 million at larger institutions, is a tempting target to whittle down. The number of Bloomberg terminals grew only 1.9 percent, to 325,000, last year. In the 10 years before the financial crisis, the number of terminals grew at an average rate of 12 percent each year, with most companies signing on for multiyear contracts. Bloomberg has sustained several challenges to its dominant market position, fending off smaller competitors hoping to bite off a corner of its business. And it has the cash reservoirs to wage a vigorous defense this time around. But Bloomberg’s own history shows that it is not easy to maintain a profitable market position like the one it has held for more than two decades. Bloomberg rose to prominence in the 1990s by nimbly replacing earlier Wall Street data companies — like Quotron and Telerate — that failed to change quickly enough to protect their longtime market dominance. Morgan Downey, the former Bloomberg executive who is building Money.Net, said he decided to leave Bloomberg in late 2013 and create a low-cost challenger after seeing how slowly Bloomberg was changing and how many of the company’s clients wanted a cheaper alternative. “When they go visit the banks, they are being told, ‘We are trying actively, not passively, to get away from being your customers,’ ” Mr. Downey said. “They’ve gotten very lazy and fat.”Apple releases major updates to leading products and pushes into new arenas. Apple unveiled an array of major improvements to its iPhones, iPads and other leading products Wednesday, including a voice-activated television box that the company said would form “a new foundation for TV.” The updated Apple TV includes some hardware improvements, such as a remote control that allows users to easily navigate through entertainment options simply by speaking to Siri, Apple’s voice assistant. But perhaps the device’s more significant feature is its ability to function as a game console, which could set up the company to enter a new arena in living room entertainment. Apple said several major gaming software companies are making versions of popular titles for Apple TV. The new device will also come with its own app store, allowing third-party developers to shape how consumers get entertainment and videos on their televisions. Apple also showed how to use the best screen in the house to look at rooms for rent on Airbnb’s Web site or homes for sale on Zillow. That was one of several story lines during Apple’s presentation in San Francisco. The electronics giant also introduced a new tablet — a $799 iPad Pro — aimed at business clients, as well as new software on its watch and other mobile devices that Apple said would revolutionize how doctors and patients interact. At one point, the audience of several thousand reporters and Apple employees at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium was shown how a pregnant woman could record her fetus's heartbeat and send the sound in a live stream to her doctor. Apple also updated its most important product, the iPhone, which accounts for 56 percent of the company’s sales. The new iPhone 6S and its larger cousin, the 6S Plus, have 12-megapixel cameras, sharper screens and a feature called 3D Touch, which brings up different menus depending on how hard a user presses the screen.  Apple also introduced a new iPad Pro, which has a display area roughly twice that of the iPad Air and is largely aimed at businesses. The tablet can be bought with a keyboard and has a beefier processor that can run heavy programs such as Microsoft Office. And, indeed, to tout the device, Apple invited executives from Microsoft, its former rival, to show how the popular office suite would work on the iPad. Also on stage were executives from Adobe, another software company Apple in the past has criticized for lax security. And in another move that broke with the past, Apple displayed a new stylus for the iPad Pro that it called the Apple Pencil, a product that likely would have been blocked by the company’s late co-founder Steve Jobs, who in 2010 mocked companies that offered styluses to consumersApple phone, tablet and TV fail to impress investors. Apple unveiled a new TV set top box that responds to voice commands and fresh iPhones that sense the pressure of a finger tap, changes which underwhelmed many social media commenters and investors. The new 6S and 6S Plus versions of the iPhone, Apple's biggest money maker, are the same size as the previous versions but come with a better camera, faster chips, new colors and the force-sensitive \"3D Touch\". Speaking before thousands of analysts, journalists and frequently cheering Apple employees, Chief Executive Tim Cook also brought on stage an executive from onetime archrival Microsoft  to illustrate the business-friendly credentials of a big new iPad, the Pro. Apple shares fell 1.9 percent to $110.15 by the close, replicating the recent history of such rollouts but also reflecting the lack of any transformative products that could jumpstart the company's sales ahead of the crucial holiday season. Apple shares have lost an average of 0.4 percent on the day of iPhone announcements over the past three years, according to BTIG Research dataGoogle is chasing Amazon Web Services in a new area –- providing access to “on-demand” supercomputing resources. On Wednesday, Google announced the general availability of something called pre-emptible virtual machines, which amount to computing resources you can rent for very little. The service, first announced in May, enables people to buy computer processing that Google isn’t using at a steep discount, provided the customer is willing to yield the resources on short notice. A.W.S. has a similar short-term usage program, called Spot Instances. It lends itself to supercomputing exercises, particularly for universities and companies that don’t want to buy multimillion-dollar machines of their own, and has been used in areas like drug discovery and learning about new materials. The addition of Google as a competitor is likely to increase the number of ways these resources are used while lowering prices. Google also appears to be stressing its skills in machine learning, a powerful tool for finding new patterns in large data sets. Using Google, cancer researchers at the Broad Institute used 51,200 computing cores to look at the interrelationships between human genes, the billions of ways they are expressed, the cell lines from some 500 types of cancer, and molecules that perturb those cells. The idea was to sort through billions of data points quickly, looking for promising areas for researchers to seek drugs and treatments. The analysis, which on a single computer server would have run about 30 years, took a couple of hours, said Chris Dwan, the acting director of Information Technology at Broad. It cost about $4,000. “This isn’t like computing a few taxi trips,” said Mr. Dwan. “This is really heavy computing in complex biological systems, steering research.” He added, “the rules of how we work are being completely rewritten.”It's Like PayPal But Pays Interest, and India's Banks Are Afraid. That’s a concern for the nation’s largest banks, because 40 percent of the money they lend comes from millions of small depositors like Mungekar. If more like her start shifting to digital money, they risk draining those deposits. Last month, the Reserve Bank of India gave licenses to 11 entities to operate so-called payment banks that will function a lot like PayPal in the U.S, but with a distinction -- customers can get interest on the money they leave there. Payment banks can’t lend and can only invest the client’s money in the safest government securities. Their revenue comes from a small commission on each transaction. Their new licences are part of central bank Governor Raghuram Rajan’s mission to cut the nation’s addiction to cash and to increase efficiency at the banks. PayTM started off as a service for adding credit to burner phones, and has evolved into the country’s largest e-wallet repository, allowing customers to pay utility bills, buy bus tickets and pay for Uber rides. Now it plans to build on its base of urban middle-class clientele to become a pseudo bank -- accepting deposits, offering peer-to-peer money transfers, even providing a debit card for cash withdrawals. The payment banking license was the first step. E-Wallets may be attractive for people wary of sharing their bank or card details on the Internet. They also make it easier to reward customers with discounts and offers redeemable at online or brick-and-mortar outlets. Apart from One97, other payment bank licensees include three large telecom operators, industrial conglomerates, the state-owned postal service, and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, which plans to run its venture with State Bank of India.Mobile payments company Square may hold IPO in fourth quarter: Bloomberg. Mobile payments company Square may file for an initial public offering by the fourth quarter of this year, although the timing depends on market conditions, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and its current chief executive, has assured investors and key employees that he will also remain Square's chief executive, Bloomberg said. At this point, the timing of Square's IPO is more contingent on market conditions than on whether Dorsey remains its CEO, Bloomberg said.Yahoo may have to pay taxes on Alibaba spinoff: Yahoo is reconsidering its plan to spin off its $23 billion stake in Alibaba after federal tax authorities declined to rule in advance on whether the transaction would mean huge capital gains taxes for Yahoo or its shareholders. Yahoo disclosed in a securities filing on Tuesday that the Internal Revenue Service told the company on Sept. 2 that it would not provide any guidance about the tax liability related to the spinoff ahead of the deal. The Internet company said that its own tax advisers still believed the spinoff of its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, a leading Chinese e-commerce company, would be tax-free, in part because it would be bundling a small-business division with the Alibaba stock into a new company called Aabaco Holdings. However, Yahoo said its board was now considering its options in light of the I.R.S. decision. Analysts say Yahoo’s options could include restructuring the spinoff or selling all or part of its 15 percent stake in Alibaba. Yahoo shareholders have been eagerly awaiting the spinoff, which analysts say accounts for far more of Yahoo’s stock price than its core advertising business. The Alibaba spinoff was intended to be a reward to Yahoo’s long-suffering shareholders. “It’s a big setback for Mayer,” said Eric Jackson, founder of the investment fund Ironfire Capital, who has been agitating for Yahoo to do more to unlock the value of its assets. “This was going to be the one feather in her cap, and now it’s seemingly not going to happen.” If Yahoo proceeds without the I.R.S. opinion, it may ultimately have to defend its move in court. An I.R.S. auditor, reviewing the company’s books several years down the road, could declare that the spinoff was taxable. Yahoo would probably go to court to challenge the decision, and Mr. Willens said the company would most likely prevail. Analysts have estimated that the company would owe about $9 billion in taxes if the transaction were fully taxable. In structuring the spinoff, Yahoo proposed to transfer that liability to Aabaco. So in theory, Ms. Mayer could proceed with the spinoff and focus on running Yahoo, leaving Aabaco shareholders to bear the risk of an audit.Restaurant of the Future? Service With an Impersonal Touch There’s a new quinoa restaurant in San Francisco — yes, quinoa restaurants are a thing in San Francisco, so that’s not what’s noteworthy. At this restaurant, customers order, pay and receive their food and never interact with a person. The restaurant, Eatsa, the first outlet in a company with national ambitions, is almost fully automated. There are no waiters or even an order taker behind a counter. There is no counter. There are unseen people helping to prepare the food, but there are plans to fully automate that process, too, if it can be done less expensively than employing people. For optimists, it’s a way to make restaurant-going more efficient and less expensive. For pessimists, it’s the latest example of how machines are stealing people’s jobs. Either way, it’s like heaven for misanthropes, or those who are in too much of a hurry to chat with a server. The quinoa — stir-fried, with arugula, parsnips and red curry — tasted quite good. Whether a restaurant that employs few people is good for the economy is another question. Restaurants, especially fast-food restaurants, have traditionally been a place where low-skilled workers can find employment. Most of the workers are not paid much, though in San Francisco employers of a certain size must pay health benefits and in 2018 a minimum wage of $15. Mr. Friedberg said that was not the reason his team automated so many roles. “Technology allows us to completely rethink how people get their food,” he said. Automation is transforming every industry. Business owners look to substitute machines for human labor. It happened to blue-collar workers in factories and white-collar workers in banks and even law firms. With self-driving vehicles, it may happen in the taxi and trucking industries. Robots and artificial intelligence machines are expected to transform health care. Automation, in rudimentary forms, is already part of many restaurants. Reservations are made online, orders arrive at the kitchen electronically, and bills are paid with a swipe on an iPad. Chains like Chili’s and airport restaurants use tablet computers for ordering and paying, to speed the process and cut personnel costs. It might be a harbinger of a future in which eating out no longer involves waiters. Restaurants with servers could become the novelty, reserved for occasions when you want more ambience and hands-on attention than Eatsa’s “food delivery system.”Netflix May Be Setting Its Sights on Four More Asian Markets: Netflix will enter Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea early next year, according to a press release that was posted in Chinese on its website and taken down. The online offering will include movies, TV shows and content suitable for children, according to the statement. Additional details on pricing and programs will be announced later, the statement said. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment. Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, is racing to complete a global expansion by the end of next year. The company’s growth prospects have made the stock the top performer in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index this year (The stock has risen 95 percent this year), with subscribers exceeding 65 million in 50 countries. Still, the shares have pulled back in recent weeks, in part due to concern over increased competition for viewer’s dollars. Time Warner’s HBO, Hulu and Amazon.com have all boosted their online offerings this year, while Apple is considering its own video streaming service. Netflix introduced service in Japan Sept. 2, starting at $5.40 a month.How will autonomous cars deal with insurance liabilities? By shifting them toward manufacturers, says a study: Hacker attacks or faulty software could shift the burden of legal and regulatory liability toward makers of self-driving cars and away from customers, experts say, forcing regulators and insurers to develop new models. Autonomous cars have the potential to reduce the rate of traffic accidents as sensors and software give a car faster and better reflexes to prevent a collision. However, a greater level of automation increases the need for cyber security and sophisticated software, experts said. \"Although accident rates will theoretically fall, new risks will come with autonomous vehicles,\" said Domenico Savarese, Group head of Proposition Development and Telematics at Zurich Insurance. \"What should be done in the case of a faulty software algorithm? Should manufacturers be required to monitor vehicles post-sale in the case of a malfunction or a hacker attack?\" Savarese asked. While established models for assigning liability - such as holding the owner responsible for what the car does - will still be relevant, the onus may shift toward manufacturers. Greater automation may also change consumer behavior and affect insurance costs if drivers become less vigilant and less practiced in their ability to avert an accident. \"Could a manufacturer become liable if a distracted driver causes an accident while relying on autopilot? It's too early to tell,\" Savarese said, adding that increased liability would unlikely deter carmakers since customers were demanding more self-driving functions. Software and connected cars are creating new opportunities for insurance companies to customize policies to clients. \"You could pay for how much you drive, or get a lower premium based on how well you drive,\" Savarese said, adding that these policies will only be made possible if the client allows the insurer to monitor them. Without driver consent, the insurer will have no right to spy on the driver, not even for exceeding the speed limit. If customers buy in to the idea of lower premiums in exchange for higher monitoring, they can opt to have some sort of black box device installed in their car or via their smartphone.Okta Is Now a Unicorn After $75 Million Funding Round. Okta, the startup that helps companies manage their sign-in information for hundreds of cloud services and business software applications, has landed a $75 million round of funding at an implied valuation of $1.2 billion. The investment is coming from existing investors, including the venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners and Sequoia Capital. Total capital raised is now $230 million. It has been about 15 months since Okta last raised money. Last year it took a $75 million round led by Sequoia that valued the company at about $600 million. Sequoia is a significant investor, having also led Okta’s D round in 2013 and its C round in 2012. Okta is also notable for being Andreessen Horowitz’s first investment in the cloud software area back in 2010 when the firm led its A round. Since then the company has expanded into new lines of business, including helping companies manage their mobile devices.Didi Kuaidi raises $3 billion as rival Uber China brings in $1.2 billion. Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Kuaidi is set to raise about $3 billion through its latest fundraising round, said two people familiar with the matter, just as funding at the Chinese unit of rival Uber reaches $1.2 billion. The inflow of cash raises the stakes between two of the world's most valuable start-ups. It also illustrates how investors are undeterred by the two companies spending heavily as they subsidize rides to gain market share, betting on China's Internet-linked transport market becoming the world's biggest. Didi Kuaidi, which has the largest market share of car-hailing apps in China, in July said it raised $2 billion, and that the amount may rise another \"few hundred million\" due to what it said was tremendous interest from global investors.Baidu to Boost Spending on India, Indonesia as Mobile Sales Boom: Baidu plans to boost investments in India and Indonesia as China’s largest Web search provider tries for a greater presence on smartphones. “They have a lot of characteristics that mimic China’s development,” Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Li said during an interview in Beijing on Monday. “There is no legacy of PC user behavior and probably mobile is going to have a very speedy development.” Baidu is spending on new businesses while locked in competition with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. In July, Baidu forecast sales below estimates, and Chairman Robin Li pledged to tap its $12 billion of cash to build out its shopping, taxi and delivery services amid China’s economic slowdown. China saw its first decline in smartphone shipments in six years during the first quarter, while India’s shipment volume surged 44 percent in the second quarter. India is now the world’s third-largest smartphone market. During the past two years, Baidu spent almost $1 billion on more than 20 investments, including Uber, travel website Qunar and video-streaming service iQiyi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is now exploring investments in the local education and medical sectors, Li said. The spending likely will be small, with Baidu interested in minority stakes as well as full acquisitions, she said. Baidu also is keen to make use of its relationships with educational institutions by providing student loans, President Zhang Ya-Qin said in a separate interview. It has issued 100 million yuan ($15.7 million) in loans, averaging 20,000 yuan each, since starting its lending program last month, he said.Zomato raises $60M from Temasek, Vy Capital, is a Unicorn now: Restaurant listings and review firm Zomato, which is expanding its business into food ordering and table reservation, has entered the coveted ‘Unicorn Club’ as it has just raised $60 million (Rs 390 crore when it sealed the deal) in a fresh round of funding from Singapore government’s investment company Temasek and existing investor Vy Capital. Although it has not disclosed the valuation, back-of-the-envelope calculations show Zomato is now valued around $1 billion. This would make it one of the eight odd Indian unicorns, a tag meant for startups sporting over $1 billion valuation. Flipkart, Snapdeal, Ola, One97 Communications, InMobi, Quikr and Mu Sigma are the other known Unicorns from India. Though some of these firms were launched years ago, their current core business took shape just around five years back. For Zomato, this is its third round of funding since last November when it bagged $60 million and followed it up with another $50 million this April. It was valued at $660 million (post money) in November 2014.\n",
      "Google hopes to reenter China by fall: Google expects to return to mainland China as early as this fall following a five-year absence, tech website The Information reported on Friday. The company hopes to get Chinese government approval for a China version of its Play store mobile app, The Information reported, citing people familiar with the plan. The tech giant is also planning to extend support of a version of Android for wearable devices in the country, The Information cited one of the people as saying. Google has assured Chinese authorities that it will follow local laws and block Play store apps that the government deems objectionable, one person familiar with the plans told the website. The Play store app will only work on devices running the recently unveiled \"M\" version of Android, and only on devices that comply with China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology requirements, The Information reported. Google is also planning to offer new incentives to phone makers to upgrade Android phones to the latest versions of its operating system, one person familiar with the plans told the website.\n",

      "New Apple TV Is Said to Focus on Games, Challenging Traditional Consoles: Apple is expected to make games a primary selling point of its new Apple TV product, which is scheduled to be announced on Wednesday in San Francisco, according to people briefed on Apple’s plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This is a big change from Apple’s previous versions of Apple TV, a device shaped like a hockey puck that for the first eight years of its existence has mainly been used to stream videos and music. “I think Apple’s going to create a big new category in gaming, one that others have tried and failed to create before,” said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at the technology research firm Jackdaw Research. “What the Apple TV has the potential to do is to bring casual gaming to the living room and make it a much more social activity.” Most game executives and analysts see little chance that Apple will be able to woo hard-core fans of the leading high-end game consoles, the Xbox One from Microsoft and the PlayStation 4 from Sony — both of which will most likely still have better graphics than the new Apple TV. Gamers who fancy big-budget games like Call of Duty and Destiny will probably not be easily persuaded to switch systems. That still leaves a large market of casual gamers whom Apple could target with the new Apple TV: people who find traditional game controllers complicated and who enjoy lighter, less epic forms of content. The new product is expected to have a starting price around $150, according to the people briefed on the product. While that is more than double the price of the least expensive Apple TV on sale today, it is significantly less than the latest traditional game consoles, which range in price from $300 to $500, depending on the maker and configuration. The business opportunity for Apple could be huge. The company now takes nearly a third of the revenue from sales of any games and other software purchased in its app stores. Total revenue from console games is expected to be more than $27 billion this year, which is more than a third of the $75 billion global games business, according to estimates by PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n",

      "Ireland Seen Losing Apple Tax Skirmish, Triggering Legal Battle: Ireland will probably face censure from European authorities within months in relation to its tax dealings with Apple Inc., according to a person with knowledge of the matter. A finding against Ireland will spark a legal battle that may last years, as the government is ready to fight the decision in the European Union Court of Justice, according to the person, who asked not to be named because the case is ongoing. In preliminary findings last year, European antitrust authorities said Apple’s tax arrangements were improperly designed to give the iPhone maker a financial boost in exchange for jobs in the country. Apple said in 2013 it had paid an effective tax rate of less than 2 percent in Ireland over the previous ten years. The EU inquiry comes amid a global crackdown on corporate tax-affairs, with the European Commission estimating that tax avoidance and evasion in the region cost about 1 trillion euros ($1.11 trillion) a year. In a worst-case scenario, Apple may face a $19 billion bill if the government in Dublin ultimately loses and is forced to recoup tax from the company, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Rod Hall.\n",
      "Extra screen time drags down teenagers' exam grades, study finds: Teenagers who spend an extra hour a day surfing the internet, watching TV or playing computer games risk performing two grades worse in exams than their peers who don't, according to research by British scientists. An extra hour in front of the TV or online at age 14-and-a-half was linked with 9.3 fewer exam points at age 16 -- equivalent to two grades, for example from a B to a D. Two extra hours was linked to 18 fewer points. Unsurprisingly, the results also showed that pupils doing an extra hour of daily homework and reading scored better - getting on average 23.1 more points than their peers. The scientists said further research was needed to confirm the effect conclusively, but advised parents worried about their children's grades to consider limiting screen time. In a breakdown analysis of different screen activities, the researchers found that TV came out as the most detrimental in terms of exam performance. In a study of more than 800 students aged 14 and 15, researchers from Cambridge University also found that physical activity had no effect on academic performance. Since this was a prospective study, in which the researchers followed the pupils over time to see how different behaviors affected performance, the scientists said it was reasonable to conclude that too much screen time reduced academic achievement.Indian Shopkeepers Help You Tap ‘Buy’: Since 2013, at least $8.6 billion has poured into Indian e-commerce companies. The slice of the population that’s ever shopped online: 4 percent. As the country’s leading Internet bazaars—Flipkart, Snapdeal, and Amazon India—hawk wares to the urban, English-speaking middle class, they’re all but ignoring the 510 million working-age adults living in rural areas. “These people don’t trust an app or a website” even if they have a phone, says Krishna Lakamsani, founder of e-commerce startup IPay. “They will only buy from someone they know and trust.” That’s why IPay and rival StoreKing are recruiting local shopkeepers to sell online goods in their stores in exchange for commissions. By relying on merchants to persuade people to buy online, IPay says it moves about $1.6 million worth of merchandise each month through 6,000 shopkeepers’ tablets in India’s southern states; StoreKing sells $4.2 million through 10,000. The early returns are promising, even if they’re a sliver of Flipkart and Snapdeal, each of which says it sold $300 million worth of goods in June. Amazon wouldn’t disclose sales. For the shopkeepers, commissions range from 4 percent to 10 percent, and the tablets—$134 from IPay, $226 from StoreKing—quickly pay for themselves. During the eight months Panjala has had the IPay unit, he says, each day he’s done about $30 worth of business on it, one-seventh of his sales. Using shopkeepers to push the tablets means IPay and StoreKing don’t have to worry about training most customers to order through their apps. Because shipments get delivered to the shops, there’s less risk of losing goods on remote roads. And the buyers pay cash, so the companies don’t have to invest in electronic payment systems. “We’ve been generating operating profits from Day One,” says StoreKing Chief Executive Officer Sridhar Gundaiah. “That’s something none of the big e-commerce companies can boast of.” Amazon and Snapdeal say they’re experimenting with kiosks that also help customers buy online. StoreKing and IPay are creating a rural e-commerce market in India by selling via tablets in thousands of local stores.Motorola Challenges Apple With a New Moto 360 Smartwatch: With the second generation collection of Moto 360 smartwatches, Motorola is doubling down on design while claiming that it has drastically improved on the technical side, too. The new Moto 360 isn't a single watch with a few small variations, as the first edition was. This watch comes in three basic variations, each with a number of customizable details. Two watches are intended for men, one that's 46 millimeters across and a second that's 42mm. They take 24mm and 20mm straps, respectably. Because the watches have lugs this year (the bits that jut out to hold the strap), all 360 models can use any properly sized watch straps, not just those from Motorola. There is also a special women's watch, which is still 42mm but uses slimmer 16mm straps to give the illusion of a smaller size. The watches have premium look that comes with a premium price tag: from $299. By comparison, the 2014 Moto 360 currently starts at $149. Since Android Wear now works with the iPhone, Motorola seems to be positioning this smartwatch in direct opposition to the Apple Watch, and doubling the price now puts the Moto 360 in the same bracket as the Apple Watch Sport—and still well below the tariff for the standard Apple Watch.Capillary raises $45M from Warburg Pincus, others: Bangalore-based Capillary Technologies, a SaaS-based CRM solutions provider, has secured around $45 million in a fresh round of funding led by private equity firm Warburg Pincus. Its existing investors Sequoia Capital and Norwest Venture Partners have also participated in the round. It added that the fresh round of investment has more than doubled the valuation of the company to about Rs 1,200 crore and that Capillary has already used the funds to acquire two startups: MartJack, a digital commerce solution company owned by Reasoning Global eApplications and machine learning startup Ruaha Labs. The company had also picked up a minority stake in customer satisfaction management firm CloudCherry recently. Capillary was set up in August 2008 by IIT Kharagpur alumni Reddy, Krishna Mehra and Ajay Modani. It is into cloud-based software solutions that help retailers engage with customers through mobile, social and in-store channels.New iOS malware should make you think twice about jailbreaking your iPhone: Information about the Apple accounts of more than 200,000 iPhone users who \"jailbroke\" their phones has been stolen by cybercriminals who could use the data to lock the phones and hold them for ransom, according to Palo Alto Networks, a cybersecurity research firm. The malware behind the digital theft, dubbed \"KeyRaider,\" has \"successfully stolen over 225,000 valid Apple accounts and thousands of certificates, private keys, and purchasing receipts,\" Palo Alto researchers said in a blog post. The stolen data appears to have been downloaded to an insecure server where hackers can easily gain access to it, the researchers said. The problem appears to be isolated to phones that were altered to bypass Apple's attempts to keep users safe. Apple keeps tight control over what apps are allowed on iPhones, running basic security tests before allowing them to be downloaded. But some iPhone users have bristled at such restrictions, and to escape them, some people \"jailbreak\" their phones -- taking steps to get around restrictions built into the devices so can they install things not available in the official App Store.Indian woman who sued Uber over rape accusation ends lawsuit: A woman who sued Uber after accusing one of its drivers of raping her in India has voluntarily ended her lawsuit against the company, according to a court filing on Tuesday. The passenger, who reported being raped and beaten after hailing a ride with the Uber driver in Delhi last year, sued the online car service in a U.S. federal court in January, claiming the company failed to maintain basic safety procedures. The driver was arrested by Indian police and appeared in court in December. Uber's Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick at the time called the incident \"horrific\" and pledged to help \"bring this perpetrator to justice.\" However, Uber also argued in court filings that the woman sued the wrong corporate entity as the driver had a contract with Uber B.V., a Netherlands-based entity with no U.S. operations. The court filing did not disclose any details on how the case was settled, and representatives for Uber and the woman declined to commenThis Company Is Still Making Audio Cassettes and Sales Are Better Than Ever: The audiocassette tape is not dead. In fact, one Springfield, Mo., cassette maker says it has had its best year since it opened in 1969. “You can characterize our operating model as stubbornness and stupidity. We were too stubborn to quit,” said National Audio Company President Steve Stepp. NAC is the largest and one of the few remaining manufacturers of audiocassettes in the U.S. The profitable company produced more than 10 million tapes in 2014 and sales are up 20 percent this year. “Probably the thing that has really enlarged our business at a faster phase than anything is the retro movement,” Stepp said. \"There's the nostalgia of holding the audio cassette in your hand.” NAC has deals with major record labels like Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group as well as a number of small contracts with indie bands. About 70 percent of the company’s sales are from music cassettes while the rest are blank cassettes. “There was a drive from the independent bands to get that warm analog sound again, and it just continued to grow and grow,” said NAC Production Manager Susie Brown. The company still uses machines built in the 1970s in its production lines.Why Lyft Should Go Public Before Uber: It’s no secret that Lyft is far smaller than Uber. It’s in 65 cities in the U.S. compared to Uber’s 60 countries around the world. A 2014 study done by financial firm FutureAdvisor, which analyzed U.S. credit and debit card transactions, said that Uber’s American revenue was 12 times that of Lyft. Uber’s aggression has resulted in its American dominance; even its name has become common slang for “ride-share.” If Lyft was to go public before Uber, it would steal some of the black car company’s thunder. Consumer tech IPOs are regularly big marketing events. Given that few on-demand companies have gone public, the first IPO of a ride-hailing service would attract a lot of attention. By going public first, Lyft would also be able to grab early dollars, attracting investors that didn’t have the opportunity to access Uber’s big private funding rounds. Just like Uber injured Lyft’s private fundraising efforts by snapping up a huge array of potential investors for itself, Lyft could try a similar tactic with the public market. Not everyone will have the money or risk-taking appetite to back multiple ride-hailing companies. Lastly, a comparatively early IPO would give Lyft more money for its battle with Uber. At this point, the former has far less cash reserves — $1 billion — than the latter, which has more than $5 billion. Going public is primarily a way to raise a lot of money and fuel the business’s growth, and Lyft could use that. Despite the reasons it would make sense for Lyft to go public before Uber, its investors and advisers warned that they weren’t sure that was likely to happen. One said that since Lyft’s founders, John Zimmer and Logan Green, were “conservative” in their endeavors they might not take the risk of paving the ride-hailing IPO way. Another said that the company wouldn’t want to preempt a public offering if its finances and growth numbers weren’t strong enough for the quarterly scrutiny of the market (see Twitter as an example of why an early IPO doesn’t always end well).Apple and Cisco Team Up on iPhone and iPad Sales: Apple Inc. is teaming up with Cisco Systems Inc. to make its mobile devices work better with corporate networks using Cisco’s equipment, part of a push by Apple to expand sales to business customers. The partnership, announced on Monday by Cisco Executive Chairman John Chambers and Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook at Cisco’s annual sales meeting in Las Vegas, will make it easier to use iPhones and iPads together with Cisco’s products, including videoconferencing systems and the WebEx online meeting service. Last year, Apple and International Business Machines Corp. set aside a three-decade-old rivalry to create business software for iPhone and iPad users, seeking to cater to an increasingly mobile workforce. While Apple is pursuing a bigger slice of the market for corporate users of smartphones and tablets, IBM and Cisco are looking for opportunities in the mobile-computing boom. Engineers from both companies have been working together for 10 months, and Cisco and Apple salespeople will go on joint sales calls, he said. For example, iPhone users could click on a calendar appointment, and immediately start a videoconference or Cisco’s Spark chat application, instead of having to pull up each separately. IPhone users’ personal contacts can be integrated with directories on their desk phones. And since workers are increasingly mobile, calls from work colleagues would automatically ring on both the desk phone and iPhone.Apple and Cisco are also working on behind-the-scenes networking enhancements. Using a feature called Fast Lane, a videoconference that’s critical to closing a deal can be given more bandwidth priority over YouTube video streams to desktops. Cisco is also developing ways to help companies prevent network slowdowns when Apple releases updates to its iOS software, by storing parts of Apple’s software code so that iPhone owners on Cisco networks won’t have to download it from a far-off data centers.India’s Antitrust Commission Accuses Google Of Rigging Its Search Results: Less than a week after it responded to anti-competition claims laid down by the EU, Google is under-fire once again for its business practices. This time in India. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has charged the U.S. company with rigging search results to benefit its many businesses, as The Economic Times reports. Google copped a $166,000 fine last year for failing to cooperate with this probe, but this time around, the worst case scenario could see it fined up to 10 percent of its revenue — the company posted a net income of $14 billion on $66 billion in revenue for 2014 — according to reports. TechCrunch understands that the CCI’s document is over 600 pages in length, although the chief concerns center around how Google positions and uses its own services with its search engine. Like the initial European investigation, Indian authorities appear to believe that its search engine is favoring the company’s maps service, travel sites, and advertising products, at the expense of competitors and those that use its advertising services. As part of its probe, the CCI sought out industry opinions on Google’s position. Economic Times reported that a bevy of high-profile technology companies — including Flipkart, Facebook, and Nokia — corroborated the complaint, which was initially filed by matrimony service Bharat, nonprofit Consumer Unity and Trust Society. TechCrunch understands from sources, though, that it wasn’t all one-way traffic. Other companies had voiced no complaint in response to the various accusations levied against Google, and those include Times Internet, Make My Trip, Group M, and Rediff.U.S. developing sanctions against China over cyberthefts: The Obama administration is developing a package of unprecedented economic sanctions against Chinese companies and individuals who have benefited from their government’s cybertheft of valuable U.S. trade secrets. The U.S. government has not yet decided whether to issue these sanctions, but a final call is expected soon — perhaps even within the next two weeks, according to several administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Issuing sanctions would represent a significant expansion in the administration’s public response to the rising wave of ­cyber-economic espionage initiated by Chinese hackers, who officials say have stolen everything from nuclear power plant designs to search engine source code to confidential negotiating positions of energy companies. Any action would also come at a particularly sensitive moment between the world’s two biggest economies. President Xi Jinping of China is due to arrive next month in Washington for his first state visit — complete with a 21-gun salute on the South Lawn of the White House and an elaborate State Dinner. There is already tension over a host of other issues, including maritime skirmishes in the South China Sea and China’s efforts to devalue its currency in the face of its recent stock market plunge. At the same time, the two countries have deep trade ties and the administration has sometimes been wary of seeming too tough on China.Hotels Fight Back Against Sites Like Expedia and Priceline: For years, travelers have been drawn to online sites like Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz and Priceline to find and reserve hotel rooms, flights and rental cars. Hotels welcomed the system — or at least learned to live with it — even though the business came at the cost of substantial commissions. But now they are fighting back. With the online giants consolidating and potentially tightening their hold on travel bookings, major hotel chains are offering a host of benefits to lure travelers to book with them directly: digital check-in, free meals, Wi-Fi and even the ability to choose a specific room. At the same time, the industry has been outspoken with regulators this year in an attempt to block a merger of two of the largest online booking companies, Expedia and Orbitz. Hilton has introduced a number of services for guests who book directly, including a digital check-in option that eliminates waiting in line. Quickly adopted by its customers, the app is now used by over one million people each month, according to Geraldine Calpin, who oversees Hilton’s worldwide digital efforts. Hilton also offers direct-booking guests the ability to choose their exact room, a feature similar to an airplane’s seat-map function. “The guest can see the plan of each floor and click on the room they want,” Ms. Calpin said. Loyalty programs also help steer consumers toward booking directly with hotels, with rewards points and “elite” level benefits like concierge lounges, free meals and upgrades. Some chains are also trying to beat online travel agencies at their own game. Marriott has arranged for some rooms to be booked directly through the travel review site TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor gets a commission, but only about half what Expedia would charge. Expedia has been on a takeover binge this year: In January, it snapped up Travelocity, for $280 million, and last year it acquired a popular Australian site, Wotif.com. Its proposed takeover of Orbitz would give the combined company control of roughly 75 percent of the entire domestic market for third-party online booking, according to the research firm Phocuswright, potentially giving it enormous leverage over the commissions that hotels pay for their listings.Russia’s Fist Just Clenched Around the Internet a Little Tighter: Global Internet firms operating in Russia wake up on Tuesday to a new era in Kremlin regulation. A law now forces tech firms with Russian customers to operate local servers to handle Russian personal data. It’s the latest in a string of about 20 laws tightening government control of the Internet, all put into place since President Vladimir Putin’s re-election in 2012. Taken at face value the new program is aimed at protecting the privacy of Russian citizens. It’s not a uniquely Russian idea, and is something Brazil and Germany are also exploring in the post-Snowden era. Yet human rights activists fear the regulation will be misused, allowing officials to spy on citizens and suppress political activists. It comes into force days after Wikipedia was briefly blacklisted because of an article about cannabis. All eyes are now on Facebook, Google and Twitter, which have been meeting with the Kremlin in private to make sense of the law. At this stage it’s not clear whether they will agree to comply.Venture capital cash surfers may see waves recede in market turmoil: The waves of cash surfed relentlessly by some of Silicon Valley's largest venture-backed businesses are showing signs of receding amid concern the companies may already be worth more than their likely valuations once they finally go public. Investors have created 132 privately held companies valued at $1 billion or more each, according to tracker firm CB Insights, including ride-hailing service Uber [UBER.UL], accommodation service Airbnb and messaging app Snapchat. After a turbulent week for equities, prompted by worries about the faltering Chinese economy, it may take longer for companies aiming to join their ranks to raise multimillion-dollar funding rounds, and they may not get the investment terms they want. \"Many companies in the market for funding right now are struggling to meet their valuation expectations and are going to have to reassess,\" said Jon Sakoda of venture firm NEA. \"Investors are now being much more selective identifying which companies can succeed under the scrutiny of the public markets,\" said Roger Lee, an investing partner with Battery Ventures. One indicator could be GSV Capital, a Nasdaq-traded fund that buys shares of private companies from early employees and others. The fund, which as of June 30 held 12.5 percent of its assets in data-analysis company Palantir and 7.7 percent in storage company Dropbox, has dropped 6 percent since Aug. 20. One late-stage venture investor said that five to six startups he declined to fund last quarter - because of what he considered pricey terms - came back willing to re-enter negotiations after being turned down elsewhere.The CEO of the company behind Ashley Madison is resigning: The chief executive of the parent company of Ashley Madison, a dating site targeting people looking for extra-marital affairs, resigned Friday after a massive hack exposed the personal information of millions of its users. Earlier this month, personal information about millions of Ashley Madison customers, including e-mails, member profiles, credit-card transactions and other sensitive information, showed up online. A group known as Impact Team took credit for the hack, which is now under investigation by the FBI and Canadian authorities.The information was initially only accessible on the dark Web, where users must use anonymous browsing tools. But soon after the hack, databases showed up on the broader Web allowing people to search some parts of the data. Analysis of that data seemed to suggest that most of the female profiles on the site were fake. Those millions of Ashley Madison men were paying to hook up with women who appeared to have created profiles and then simply disappeared. Were they cobbled together by bots and bored admins, or just user debris? Whatever the answer, the more I examined those 5.5 million female profiles, the more obvious it became that none of them had ever talked to men on the site, or even used the site at all after creating a profile. Actually, scratch that. As I’ll explain below, there’s a good chance that about 12,000 of the profiles out of millions belonged to actual, real women who were active users of Ashley Madison. When you look at the evidence, it’s hard to deny that the overwhelming majority of men using Ashley Madison weren’t having affairs. They were paying for a fantasy.Uber hires two security researchers who hacked a moving Jeep to improve car technology: Uber has hired two top vehicle security researchers, the company said on Friday, high-profile additions that come as the ride-hailing service ramps up its work on technology for self-driving cars. Charlie Miller, who had been working at Twitter Inc, and Chris Valasek, who worked at security firm IOActive, have resigned from their jobs and will join Uber next week. Miller and Valasek won wide attention this month after demonstrating that they could hack into a moving Jeep. Uber on Tuesday announced a partnership with the University of Arizona, offering the school grant money to fund research into the mapping and safety technology needed for autonomous vehicles, which Uber will test on the streets of Tucson, Arizona. This partnership follows the more tumultuous effort earlier this year at Carnegie Mellon University that resulted in Uber hiring away more than 40 of its top scientists and researchers, leaving one of the world's top robotics research institutions reeling.Is the Tech Market Hitting Middle Age?: First it was PCs. Now it’s tablets. And very soon, it will be smartphones. Each of these markets has — or will — hit its peak in both revenue and unit shipments in short order. Each has moved (or will soon move) from the soaring grandeur of youth and young adulthood to the dowdiness of mature middle age. As these inevitable market developments occur, important shifts are starting to happen. Not only will device manufacturers and their key component suppliers have to evolve their businesses — as many have started to do — but very soon, so will companies offering software and services used by those devices. While some argue that these software and services companies are taking over the world, it’s naive to think that their growth can be maintained completely independent of the devices. At a fundamental level, the two are linked, and when the device numbers peak, so too do the potential users of any software or service. Admittedly, there’s more of a growth opportunity over the short term for these software and service companies, but that won’t last forever, either. As with any major industry transformation, this means that some of the biggest industry players may not survive in their current form (or at all), while others are likely to go through some dramatic transformations. This also means that there will be tremendous opportunities for today’s smaller or even yet-to-be started companies. The tech industry’s transition to a more mature market does bring with it the opportunity for some potentially boring baggage when it comes to things like stagnant unit-growth rates. However, instead of viewing this as a midlife crisis, smart, innovative companies will figure out ways to see these developments as a midlife celebration that can open up new opportunities.Your First 10 Customers Can Make Or Break You: Early in a startup’s life, the main focus is building the right product for the right market. For most B2B startups, this is the period when you start winning your first 10 customers. These 10 customers are unlike any others you’ll have over the course of your company. You’ll sell to them differently, charge them differently and try to get different things out of the relationship than you will from those that follow. This is the group that will teach you how to refine your product, whether or not you are targeting a large enough market and how to craft a scalable sales process that will help you land your next 100 customers. You’re The First Head Of Sales. It will be tempting to hire an experienced sales veteran when you’re busy trying to get the product right and grow the company, but there is a strong argument against that. The first 10 customers should be sold by you, the CEO or founder. Look For Young And Ambitious Customers. While it’s admirable to target big-name customers, the chances are unlikely that they’ll take a meeting or make a bet on a brand new product. Similarly, a potential customer who is far along or at the end of his career may not have a high tolerance for risk or change. Focus On Engagement, Not Revenue. As you land more customers and add them to your client roster, it is essential that each initial customer uses your product at the engagement level to be considered an active user. Engagement levels — not revenue numbers — are often a stronger indication of long-term product adoption. This should be your top priority. Your first set of customers will inevitably serve as reference accounts — and the more engaged users are, the better references they’ll provide. Know Who To “Sign” And When To Walk Away. Focus your initial sales efforts on prospects who aren’t your friends. To be scalable, your product will need validation outside of your network, and you need the type of honest feedback that friends don’t often provide.IZettle, a Swedish Payments Start-Up, Begins a Lending Program: Jacob de Geer, who is a Swedish entrepreneur and the co-founder of iZettle, a payments service that offers merchants a device for processing credit card transactions, says banks don’t meet the needs of many small businesses. “Financial institutions focus more on their large clients than on the small ones,” he said. “Most of them were founded way before the invention of the Internet or the smartphone.” But he thinks he has a solution. On Friday, iZettle announced a program to lend money to small businesses that use its service, providing cash advances to companies for a one-time fee. IZettle, which operates in 11 countries from Britain to Brazil, raised a further $67 million from its existing backers, including Intel Capital and American Express, to take its total fund-raising to roughly $180 million. The steps by iZettle follow similar announcements from Square, the six-year-old American payments start-up, that also has expanded from its payments roots to offer additional financial products for its small-business customers. Square also offers a device to process credit card transactions. For iZettle, the new lending program will initially be available only in Europe, and the company will charge small businesses a flat fee ?equivalent to roughly 10 to 15 percent ?of each cash advance. To recoup the money it lends to businesses, the start-up will take a small percentage of each transaction that small businesses process through its payments system. To reduce defaults, the company says it will crunch data from businesses’ existing transactions to determine their credit risk.Uber China closes $1 billion fundraising round at $7 billion valuation: sources: Uber’s China arm has closed its $1 billion fundraising round early, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, with investors still hopeful for the U.S.-based ride service despite strong domestic competition in the car-hailing market. The deal was oversubscribed, said the second source directly familiar with the fundraising. According to a fundraising document seen by Reuters last week, this round values Uber China at $7 billion, with the unit planning to list on the mainland by 2020.Shazura: A More Efficient Way to Search Images: While most image-search software finds photos using keywords or phrases, Shazura’s binary system behaves more like the human brain, visually matching images that look the same with greater speed and efficiency. Pérez de la Coba, an electrical engineer by training, began coding Shazura in 2011 out of frustration. She’d snapped a photo of a pair of shoes she wanted but had trouble finding them online with existing image-comparison services such as Google’s. Upload a file, outline what you want to search for, and Shazura’s algorithm converts the image to a lengthy “numeric signature” containing extensive descriptive information. The number for a willow, say, is distinct from that for a cypress, or a green bag from a blue one. By cutting out the intermediary translation steps, Shazura sifts through a customer’s image database more quickly and accurately and uses less computing power than traditional search engines. Without having to rely on keyword tags or extensive if-then instructions, Shazura can make large-scale image searches much easier for government agencies, advertisers, or social networks, says Pérez de la Coba. Shazura has raised $1.2 million from investors and so far the 10-employee company has licensed its technology to clothiers El Corte Inglés and RichRelevance.Apple is closing in on Fitbit: Apple, which launched the Apple Watch in June, is within striking distance of leader Fitbit Inc in the wearable devices market, market research firm IDC said. Apple shipped 3.6 million Apple Watches in the second quarter of 2015, just behind Fitbit's 4.4 million wearable fitness and health trackers, IDC said. The Apple Watch, which sports many health-related features and apps, is seen as the biggest rival to Fitbit's trackers. Shipments of wearable devices more than tripled to 18.1 million units in the second quarter, IDC said. \"It's worth noting that Fitbit only sells basic wearables - a category that is expected to lose share over the next few years, leaving Apple poised to become the next market leader for all wearables,\" the IDC report said. Fitbit Inc's stock market listing in June got a rousing response from investors, with shares jumping as much as 60 percent. They closed at $38.40 on Wednesday, nearly double their IPO price.In-Flight Wi-Fi Prices Jump as Demand Surges: Many travelers are experiencing sticker shock from in-flight Wi-Fi these days. While there are several in-flight Wi-Fi providers, including ViaSat and Global Eagle Entertainment, Gogo is the top provider, equipping more than 2,000 planes from airlines like American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Virgin America with its service, up from 1,300 in 2011. Gogo’s prices often change depending on when and where you are flying. But on some flights — especially transcontinental routes crammed with business travelers who may have cushy expense accounts — prices have doubled from three years ago. Gogo’s prices are not just higher now; they are also more unpredictable. The company uses a method called dynamic pricing, in which it tries to forecast the demand for Wi-Fi on each flight and scale pricing accordingly. So the prices for the full durations of transcontinental flights also change each day: Gogo charges the most, $40, on Mondays and Thursdays; Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays cost $34; and Saturdays are the cheapest, at $28. Driving the uneven prices on certain routes is Gogo’s reliance on higher fees to ease overcrowding of its network. With passengers packing a growing number of Internet-connected electronics like smartphones, gaming devices and tablets in their carry-on luggage, the amount of bandwidth they consume on popular flights keeps expanding. Consumers can take heart because there are several ways to pay less for in-flight Wi-Fi. If Internet in the sky is that important, you can always pick an airline offering cheaper Wi-Fi, like Southwest or JetBlue. Or if you’re flying on a Gogo-equipped airplane, you can choose a day of the week when Wi-Fi prices are lower. Another way to get a cheaper rate for Gogo is o rdering the service before boarding the plane. People can buy an all-day pass to use Wi-Fi on any Gogo-equipped flight for $16, while frequent travelers can purchase a monthly subscription for $50.Gmail To Auto-Populate Google Calendar With Things Like Flights, Hotel Bookings And Ticket Details: Google announced today that it’s starting to roll out features that will place ticket, flight, hotel and restaurant info onto Google Calendar. Automatically. For example, if you buy a flight, rent a car, book a hotel and set reservations for the day you get into town for business, all of those items will be added to your Calendar if the exact time for those events are available. Your flight would show up at 4, reservation at 9, etc.A Plunge in China Rattles Markets Across the Globe: Concerns about China’s ability to be a powerful engine of global economic growth have added to worries about the potential impact of higher interest rates in the United States, driving stocks sharply lower in Asia and Europe on Monday. When trading opened in New York, the major market measures went into what was essentially a free fall. While the steepest losses ended within minutes, share prices spent the rest of the day sharply rising and reversing course multiple times. When the day’s roller-coaster ride ended, the benchmark for stocks, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, was down 3.9 percent. That left the index off 11 percent from its May high, in what in market parlance is called a “correction,” its first since 2011. On Monday, the Shanghai composite index closed down 8.7 percent. In Europe, benchmark indexes in Germany, Britain and France fell nearly 5 percent or more. A number of emerging markets were also lower, with leading indexes in Brazil and Indonesia both down around 4 percent. In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted 1,000 points before regaining ground. Major US indices recovered some ground but still ended the day down over 3.5% each. The Treasury market was a beneficiary of the fear in stocks. The demand for bonds pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to as low as 1.90 percent before it settled at 2.01 percent. The recent market tumult began two weeks ago when the Chinese government unexpectedly allowed the value of its currency to drop, partly in response to indications that the country’s economy is weakening. The Chinese moves played into the continuing drop in the price of oil, which has taken the price of a barrel of crude oil down 65 percent over the last year. On Monday, the price of oil, as measured by a benchmark New York contract, dropped below $40. The selling in China has accelerated despite extraordinary government intervention in the last two months aimed at propping up share prices. On Sunday, the Chinese government said that the country’s pension funds would be allowed to invest in stocks for the first time. But the slide on Monday highlighted that the new policy, and several similar recent moves, have not been successful. Many investors are now hoping that the central bank, the People’s Bank of China, will cut the ratio of deposits that banks are required to keep on reserve in a bid to encourage lending and spur economic growth.How the stock selloff could kill off some tech unicorns: With so much uncertainty and market volatility, Silicon Valley firms could postpone initial public offerings, cooling a white-hot market for venture funding that has fueled the most lucrative environment for startups in history. Already, executives at RainDance Technologies, a firm that makes genomic tools to detect cancer and other diseases, announced Monday they have pulled their plan to go public, according to Reuters. And the big question is what will happen to the hundreds of startups -- a record 131 are valued at more than $1 billion -- that are now all dressed up for IPOs but with no place to go. \"Tech stocks have been getting crushed the past 6 weeks. Many names are down 25-50% from their highs. Today was very tough,\" Gurley wrote in a tweet last week. \"One might reasonably assume that this would have an adverse impact on late stage private market liquidity and valuation. I certainly do. If so, we may be nearing the end of a cycle where growth is valued more than profitability. It could be at an inflection point.\" Known as \"unicorns,\" the venture-funded firms with valuations of more than $1 billion have exploded in number to 131 companies valued at a total of $485 billion, according to venture capital research firm CB Insights. The sheer quantity of unicorns has for months caused concern of a startup-bubble, with investors racing to put money into bleeding edge innovators and their many imitators, when logically not all will thrive or even survive.Visa says its users more likely to complete online purchases than those using PayPal: Visa said on Monday online shoppers using its payment service are 17 percentage points more likely to complete their purchases than those using PayPal. Visa Checkout, which allows shoppers to store their payment information without having to re-enter it every time they make a purchase online, said 66 percent of its enrolled customers completed their transactions after putting items in their shopping cart compared to 49 percent of PayPal's Express Checkout customers. The data was collated for Visa by retail analytics firm ComScore. PayPal's online payment service offers a similar convenience by allowing customers to log into their accounts on a merchant's website. Paypal has not seen this report yet, said Anuj Nayar, senior director of platform, merchant and next gen commerce engagement. Nayar said in addition to PayPal Express Checkout the company has launched a new online payment service called PayPal One Touch, which makes using PayPal faster on any device with a single touch. \"Initial reports indicate that One Touch radically improves checkout conversion for merchants and time to checkout for consumers beyond anything else available in the market today,\" he said. Retailers and payment industry experts have often blamed the high rates of unfinished online transactions, after shoppers add items to their shopping carts, on the tiring process of re-entering payment information every time one makes a purchase. \"What has become more and more pronounced is as the size of the screen gets smaller, whether it's a tablet, mobile or a watch, the less likely it becomes a consumer will finish his purchase,\" Sam Shrauger, senior vice president of Visa's digital solutions, told Reuters.Jabong biggest loss-maker among top Rocket Internet ventures: Rocket Internet-incubated Indian fashion and lifestyle venture Jabong has become the top money losing initiative for the German emerging markets and Europe focused internet company. Jabong’s operating loss margin rose far ahead of Southeast Asian lifestyle e-commerce firm Lazada and Latin American e-commerce marketplace Linio in the first quarter of 2015, making it the most operating loss making property among Rocket Internet’s top ventures. Jabong had EBITDA loss margin of (-) 56 per cent last year, an improvement from 2013 when it posted (-) 68.5 per cent. This possibly signals how the firm is trying to push its sales faster with more discounting. This could also possibly reflect net revenues are failing to keep pace with operating expenses. Last year, in the same quarter Lazada sported the biggest EBITDA (earnings before interest tax and depreciation and amortisation) loss margin with Jabong and Linio being neck to neck, as per data shared by Rocket Internet. Also the average selling price of third-party vendors appears to be around 15 per cent higher than that of what Jabong direct e-tails to the customers. The average transaction value (including what it sells directly and products sold by other merchants) in Q1 stood at Rs 1,690 compared with a tad over Rs 1,500 in Q1 2014 and for full calendar year 2014. In the same period, average basket value of products sold directly by Jabong has risen marginally to around Rs 1,423. Third party vendors now represent around one in three transactions on Jabong every day. Meanwhile, Jabong was valued at around $480 million as of last December in its last funding round, according to Rocket Internet’s annual report. This means the firm was valued at around Rs 3,050 crore or 2.3 times its GMV for the year.On Friday, US Stocks Fell Most in 4 Years as China Dread Sank Global Markets: Turbulence in financial markets gathered momentum amid intensifying concern over slowing global growth, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average into a correction and giving other stock gauges their worst losses since 2011. Oil sank below $40 a barrel for the first time since 2009 and was set for its longest losing streak since 1986. More than $3.3 trillion has been erased from the value of global equities after China’s decision to devalue its currency spurred a wave of selling across emerging markets. The worries over slower economic growth come as a strong dollar and plunge in oil prices take a toll on corporate earnings at the same time the Federal Reserve is contemplating the first boost to interest rates since 2006. Investors are selling the biggest winners of 2015. Companies that have come to be known as the Fab Five -- Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple --have seen $97 billion in market value erased over two days. Losses have pushed the Nasdaq 100 Index down 7 percent, the biggest two-day decline since 2008. Apple entered a bear market, dropping 20 percent from a February high.A small Canadian city tries to drag intersections into the 21st century: Have you ever sat pointlessly at a red light? There’s no cross-traffic, but the traffic light is clueless, so you’re forced to wait. Miovision chief executive Kurtis McBride feels your pain. “I can’t count the number of times I’ve been sitting at a red light with no cars around me and just wondering, ‘Why am I stuck in this situation,’ ” McBride said. His Canadian start-up is bringing modern technology to an industry that is years behind. Smart intersections could learn the traffic patterns and adjust the length of red and green lights to optimize the flow of traffic. Sitting at a pointless red light would be a thing of the past. Miovision envisions full automated intersections that are powered by algorithms. One Canadian transportation agency is currently testing Miovision’s technology in seven intersections on major arteries in Cambridge, Canada. The Waterloo Region wasn’t ready to go all-in on automated intersections, but is trying the technology to learn of malfunctioning lights, and adjust the timing of its lights. Miovision, which is based near Waterloo, raised $30 million earlier this year from investors.Apple Raises $1.6 Billion in Record Corporate Bond Deal: Apple raised A$2.25 billion ($1.6 billion) with a debut Australian debt sale that’s the largest bond deal ever Down Under by a non-financial company. The iPhone maker sold A$1.15 billion of seven-year notes at a yield of 110 basis points more than swap rates and A$1.1 billion of four-year securities at a 65 basis point spread. Apple, which until November had only sold U.S. currency bonds, has since expanded its debt issuance to euros, yen, pounds and Swiss francs as well as Aussie dollars. The proceeds of Apple’s Kangaroo bond sale may be used to return capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, sale managers said in an earlier statement announcing plans to do an Aussie transaction. The Cupertino, California-based company announced in April it was boosting its capital-return program by $70 billion through March 2017 and would be accessing both U.S. and international debt markets to help pay for it. All of the longer maturity notes from Apple will be fixed-rate securities, while at the shorter tenor they are set to issue a fixed-rate portion of A$400 million and a floating-rate tranche of A$700 million. Initial price guidance on the four-year debt was for a spread of about 70 basis points, while the price talk on the seven-year notes was a gap of about 115 basis points.Dropbox’s Wall Street Challenge: Dropbox boasts a valuation in the $10 billion range. Last February the company hired a new CFO, which for many startups is a signal that their IPO moment is coming sooner rather than later. Nobody knows for sure of course, and Dropbox isn’t talking, but if the company does decide to move forward with a flotation, it could face several challenges in spite of its strong market presence. Dropbox could still have trouble persuading a doubtful Wall Street money machine, which has shown little love for cloud companies, that it can overcome several hurdles: For starters, it will need to convince them that the subscription business model with a different reporting methodology is viable. It must defend its hybrid consumer/enterprise approach — and perhaps face questions where it will concentrate its resources moving forward. Finally, the company with its core business in storage and file syncing has to find a way to overcome the commoditization of these services and the race to the bottom with some of the biggest names in the business.One of Tech’s Best Investors Keeps Passing on Deals Because Valuations Are Too Damn High: Jeremy Levine knows a good deal when he sees one. As a top venture capitalist at Bessemer Venture Partners, he has invested in Pinterest, LinkedIn, Yelp and Shopify well before they reached peak popularity and watched as the last three went public. But over the last 20 months, Levine has led just one new investment, which has yet to be announced. The reason for the pause? Valuations are still just too damn high, he says. “Prices — especially for late stage deals — have been extraordinarily high for a while now and demand flawless execution and a lot of luck,” Levine said in an email following an in-person meeting. “The former is extremely hard to achieve, and the latter is obviously outside anyone’s control. Therefore, I believe a lot of the private deals that have [been] getting done recently are providing very poor risk-adjusted-returns for investors.” “Perhaps the dramatic cool-off in the public markets over the last week will start to change things in the private markets,” he added.The ‘Unicorn’ Club, Now Admitting New Members: The $1 billion valuation metric was popularized two years ago by the venture investor Aileen Lee. She found that many of the start-ups that reaped the hugest riches for venture capital investors — Facebook and LinkedIn, for example — often reached a valuation of $1 billion or more while they were privately held. Because of their rarity, Ms. Lee called those companies “unicorns,” after the mythical creatures. Since then, numerous start-ups have attained the $1 billion distinction — and topped it. With investors rushing to bet on the next big thing, the ride-hailing service Uber received a valuation of around $51 billion, while Airbnb, the online room-rental service, is pegged at about $24 billion. And every month, more companies are jumping into the unicorn echelon. To find out which companies might be next to ascend, CB Insights, which tracks venture capital and start-ups, conducted an analysis for The New York Times. CB Insights used a proprietary software tool called Mosaic, which analyzes dozens of factors about a start-up, including the amount of money raised by a company, employee turnover, news and social media mentions, awards, customer growth and partnerships. It also examines the overall health of the industry in which the start-up competes, as well as what can be known about the quality of a company’s investors. CB Insights won a grant from the National Science Foundation to build Mosaic, using machine learning and data science to turn unstructured text into a quantitative tool to measure company health. The CB Insights analysis resulted in a list of 50 companies that cover the globe and span different tech sectors but speak to some of the trends from the current boom. Half of the companies on the list are based in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, the cradle of tech start-ups, but 10 are international, with several hailing from China and India. Ms. Lee, who coined the term unicorn, said there were more $1 billion private companies these days partly because big industries like hotels and taxis were now considered fair game for start-ups. The thing to watch, she said, is whether companies meet the expectations and goals they set when they became unicorns before they burn through the money they raised. “If they don’t do that, they’re in a dangerous position,” she said.Google, Amazon in fray to buy Tata's India Data centres: Google and Amazon are among those in talks with the Tata Group to buy the data centre business of Tata Communications in a deal expected to fetch about $650-700 million. They are competing with bulge-bracket private equity funds including the Blackstone Group, Carlyle, KKR, Bain Capital and Advent International, who are all looking to buy up to 74% stake in the data centre unit and take control of the business that is spread across 44 locations in India and abroad. Besides India, Tata Communications has data centres in the US, UK and Singapore, with over 1 million sq ft of co-location space, offering managed hosting and storage services. In India, it has facilities in leading metros such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Pune, besides some tier-II and tier-III locations. The data centre business addedRs 436 crore to Tata Communications' FY15 revenues and has about 27% EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), the company said in an investor presentation last month after its June quarter earnings.Uber Gets Investment From Tata Fund to Expand in India: Tata Capital said a fund it advises will make a “significant investment” in Uber. to help the ride-sharing service expand in India. The investment by Tata Opportunities Fund will allow Uber to benefit from its network in the country, Tata Capital said in an e-mailed statement on Wednesday, without elaborating. Tata Capital is part of the $109 billion coffee-to-cars conglomerate with over 100 group firms. The fund typically invests up to $100 million in its deals, its managing partner Padmanabh Sinha said. Uber in July said it would spend $1 billion to fan out to more Indian cities as the ride-hailing company targets to reach 1 million trips per day in the next six to nine months. Microsoft Corp. is said to have agreed to invest about $100 million in Uber valuing it at about $50 billion.Taxi app GrabTaxi raises $350 million from CIC, others: Taxi-booking app GrabTaxi said it raised over $350 million from investors including sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation, in the Southeast Asian company's largest ever fundraising round. Other investors include hedge fund Coatue Management LLC and China's mobile car-ride hailing company Didi Kuaidi, GrabTaxi said in a statement, adding that it would use the funds to expand its private vehicle hire and motorbike booking services and invest in technology. Singapore-headquartered GrabTaxi competes with the likes of Uber and Rocket Internet's Easy Taxi in the city-state and some of the other Southeast Asian markets in which it operates.Hacker's Ashley Madison data dump threatens marriages, reputations: Love lives and reputations may be at risk after the release of customer data from infidelity website Ashley Madison, an unprecedented breach of privacy likely to rattle users' attitudes towards the Internet. Hackers dumped a big cache of data containing millions of email addresses for U.S. government officials, UK civil servants and high-level executives at European and North America corporations late on Tuesday, the latest cyber attack to raise concerns about Internet security and data protection. The hacker attack has been a big blow to Toronto-based assignation website firm Avid Life Media, which owns Ashley Madison and has indefinitely postponed the adultery site's IPO plans. The data dump began to make good on the hackers' threat last month to leak nude photos, sexual fantasies, real names and credit card information for as many as 37 million customers worldwide of Ashley Madison, which uses the slogan: \"Life is short. Have an affair.\" The hackers' move to identify members of the marital cheating website appeared aimed at maximum damage to the company, which also runs websites such as Cougarlife.com and EstablishedMen.com, causing public embarrassment to its members, rather than financial gain.Chinese Consumers are skipping straight from cash to mobile finance: Financial innovation is bubbling up around the globe, but China is where digital banking, investing, and lending have gone mainstream. Technology companies armed with financial apps are challenging banks and other intermediaries for a market with 1.3 billion people and $7.8 trillion of deposits. Tencent’s WeChat (called Weixin in Chinese), Alibaba’s Alipay arm, and Baidu are leading the way with digital wallets that let consumers manage their money via their phones. Traditional banking in China is balky, backward, and inefficient—creating ample opportunities for nimble tech companies such as Alibaba and Baidu. The huge, state-owned banks do some lending to consumers and private businesses, but they typically prefer making loans to state-owned enterprises that provide implicit government guarantees. For consumers, the government banks offer low interest rates on savings accounts, making new online funds and financial products with higher rates attractive. Regulators have indicated they are open to innovation. For one thing, digital banking leaves a trail that cash doesn’t. And it might help the Chinese government get a clearer snapshot of economic activity.Mood-based playlists: How Spotify reinvented the playlist: Increasingly, music listeners are shifting away from genre labels like Hip-hop, R&B and Jazz, according to Spotify. What they really want is a set of tunes to fit their mood. It took Spotify a great deal of testing and data-crunching to arrive at that revelation. And it isn't stopping there. It's taking what it's gleaned from millions of users' listening habits to craft a new kind of song entirely: One that intensifies along with your running workout, matching its beats to your precise pace. When you speed up, it speeds up. When you slow down, it does, too. When Spotify began mixing its own playlists and tagging them (\"Focus\" for people who needed music to work to, or \"Dinnertime Acoustic\" for unwinding) it noticed a big uptick in interest, particularly when mood-based playlists were displayed right beside a traditional genre, according to Mark Silverstein, Spotify's head of product, tech and policy. Mood-based playlists aren't just different collections of songs; in the case of Spotify's commuting playlists, the company will occasionally mix in news, weather reports, even audio clips of Jimmy Fallon for some comedic diversity. As a result, fewer people began selecting genre playlists, and many more began opting for the mood-based playlists. And that carried over into the playlists people were making for themselves. That prompted Spotify to begin thinking about running more closely. For years, scientists have theorized about a link between music and exercise. One 2007 study suggested that fast, loud music was associated with faster running speeds and an increased heart rate. Another found in 2011 that music helped triathlon runners stave off exhaustion and run nearly 20 percent longer than their peers who ran in silence.Foxconn, Alibaba, others invest $500M in Snapdeal; eBay pares stake: Online marketplace Snapdeal raised $500 million in fresh funding led by iPhone manufacturer Foxconn, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and existing investor SoftBank. Its other existing investors Temasek, BlackRock, Myriad and PremjiInvest also participated in this round, as per a press statement. Separately, e-commerce giant eBay said it has sold a portion of its holding in Snapdeal, 18 months after leading a $134 million funding round in the Gurgaon-based company. Snapdeal will use the money to expand geographical reach and enhance services in a bid to better compete with well-funded rivals such as US-headquartered Amazon and Bangalore-based Flipkart. The announcement confirms a previous report that said Snapdeal has raised $500 million, citing sources. With the latest funding, Alibaba is now backing two companies (Snapdeal and Paytm) who are directly slugging it out for supremacy in India’s consumer internet space.Upstarts Raid Giants for Talent in Silicon Valley: The unicorns, a class of hot start-ups valued at $1 billion or more, are all aggressively pursuing the best and brightest minds in Silicon Valley with promises of talked-about workplaces and eye-popping payouts. Amid a general scramble for talent, Google, the Internet search company, has undergone specific raids from unicorns for engineers who specialize in crucial technologies like mapping. In particular, Uber — the largest unicorn, with a valuation of more than $50 billion — has plundered Google’s mapping unit over the last 12 months, aiming to bolster its own map research. Airbnb, the popular short-term rental start-up, has gone on a more general hiring spree, poaching more than 100 workers. While the unicorns typically pick off small groups of engineers at a time, making little impression on a large company’s total employee numbers, the poaching attacks are often aimed at siphoning off the best talent in strategic technologies. That can sting the likes of a Google, where executives have said one skilled engineer can be worth many times the average. To snag employees from large rivals, unicorns have a simple recruiting pitch: They are on a path to success, as illustrated by their rising valuations. Many offer generous equity packages of restricted stock units that can later translate to big paydays for employees if the unicorn goes public or is sold — a lure that neither Google nor any other public tech company can dangle. Also, the unicorns say they are far more fleet-footed and cutting-edge than large organizations.Alibaba Cash-Burning Buybacks Make Internet Bonds China’s Worst: China’s Internet bonds are lagging behind as disappointing earnings and plans for buybacks to shore up slumping shares fuel concern finances will deteriorate. Alibaba, China’s largest e-commerce company, announced a $4 billion share repurchase last week, while Baidu, its most-popular search engine, unveiled a $1 billion plan in July. Their bonds have contributed to a 0.4 percent loss on technology notes this quarter, the worst sector in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch investment-grade dollar note index for China that gained 0.4 percent. That’s a turnaround after Baidu’s 2012 debut in global debt markets gave it a self-proclaimed “war chest” and Alibaba’s $8 billion sale in 2014 became Asia’s biggest corporate dollar bond offering. The companies’ shares have slumped at least 9 percent this quarter as authorities tighten controls on Web content and crack down on fake goods online. “Companies such as Baidu and Alibaba came out with weaker results, and have announced cash-burning buybacks or acquisitions, which triggered a sell-off,” said Anthony Leung, a credit analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Hong Kong, said. “In addition, regular negative headlines such as the sale of counterfeit goods, have hurt their bonds.”Lenovo Joins Smartphone Compatriots for ’Make in India’: Lenovo started making smartphones in India, becoming the largest Chinese company to produce mobile devices there after the government raised import taxes. Lenovo will use contract manufacturer Flex’s factory outside the southeastern city of Chennai for its Lenovo and Motorola brands, Amar Babu, chairman of Lenovo India, said Tuesday in a phone interview. The brands will have a combined annual capacity of 6 million units, Lenovo said in a statement. Foxconn Technology Group this year began producing smartphones in India for China’s Xiaomi and OnePlus after the Indian government raised taxes on some foreign-made goods to attract investment in manufacturing. Lenovo’s announcement marks the largest Chinese name yet to be lured by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India campaign as competitors vie for a share of the world’s third-largest smartphone market. “Output from the plants is focused mainly on serving the Indian market,” Babu said. Lenovo has no immediate plans to develop phones specifically for India, he said. Lenovo considered adding smartphone manufacturing to its own personal-computer plant in Puducherry in the southeast before deciding to outsource to Flex’s existing factory in Sriperumbudur, Babu said.Airbnb partners with China Broadband, Sequoia to expand in China: Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc said on Tuesday it was partnering with investment firms China Broadband Capital and Sequoia China to expand into the Chinese market and find a chief executive for its operations in the country. The company, which was recently reported to have completed a $1.5 billion private funding round, said in a blog post it was also working with a larger group of investors, including Horizon Ventures, GGV Capital and China-based Hillhouse Capital. Airbnb, which matches people wishing to rent out all or part of their homes to temporary guests, has grown quickly and is valued at more than $20 billion. Airbnb said the number of outbound Chinese travelers using its service grew 700 percent in the past year. China Broadband and Sequoia China will help it customize technology for the Chinese market and establish a \"localized presence\" in the country, it added.Kik Takes $50 Million Investment From WeChat Parent Company Tencent, Hits $1 Billion Valuation: Kik Takes $50 Million Investment From WeChat Parent Company Tencent, Hits $1 Billion Valuation. The app has 240 million registered users and claims that 40 percent of American teenagers are actively on Kik. The deal doesn’t mean the two apps are planning to integrate, but they will have a strategic partnership moving forward, according to Kik co-founder Chris Best. That means sharing things like data and app information, he added. He also said that Kik won’t be targeting China anytime soon (seems obvious now given WeChat’s foothold there) but plans to use the money to grow the company’s employee base.Uber’s Popularity in India Has Led to a Mini Vehicle Boom: Uber has posed a threat to auto sales by enticing car owners to ditch their keys. In India, its popularity has sparked a vehicle boom instead. Maruti Suzuki has seen a surge in demand for its DZire Tour sedan because of the rising popularity of car-booking apps, said R.S. Kalsi, executive director at India’s largest carmaker. Toyota Motor is offering special deals to woo drivers and fleet operators that are boosting orders for its Etios sedan, which starts at 611,000 rupees ($9,400). Uber and other booking apps have announced plans to expand to smaller cities in India, where public transportation is often inadequate. The services have created a boom in demand from for-hire car companies expanding their fleets and from individual operators buying new cars to drive for the apps. “The plans of all these companies are big,” said N. Raja, director and senior vice president for sales and marketing at Toyota’s India unit. “We’re happy to see them talking about expanding the number of cars in the next 12 months.” In the four months through July, Maruti Suzuki’s DZire Tour, sold only as a taxi, surged 152 percent while Toyota’s Etios compact sedan gained 28 percent. Industrywide passenger-vehicle sales expanded 7.5 percent in the same period. The surge in demand for these cheaper models is helping to drive a recovery in vehicle sales in India. Automakers like Maruti Suzuki get about a third of their sales volume from rural areas, where incomes are correlated to rainfall during the monsoon season and a good harvest.A Gushing Review for Windows 10: \"I used to doubt Microsoft. Then I installed Windows 10\": I don’t know if I broke a law of computing or committed heresy. But I installed Windows 10 on my Macbook Pro. I had feared that this would condemn me to purgatory in the gates of computing hell. But it has been an incredibly positive experience: my favorite Microsoft Office applications — Outlook, Word, and PowerPoint — work faster than ever before, and I can still use Apple peripherals — a Thunderbolt Display and Thunderbolt external hard drives. The best part is Windows 10 itself: it is a beautifully designed operating system that gives me the best of the past and present — maintaining the usability and familiarity of the old Windows operating system, and letting me download slick apps designed for tablets. Another Microsoft product that I had written off years ago is Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. The jury is still out, but Microsoft’s new browser, Edge, seems faster than Google’s Chrome. I may end up switching browsers as well. What is clear is that Microsoft is back — in full force. This is a good thing; Apple and Google desperately need the competition that Microsoft will once again provide.Android Has a New Name, ‘Marshmallow,’ but the Same Old Security Problem: Android’s latest version now has its own culinary sobriquet: Marshmallow. But the release of the operating system, announced in May and arriving this fall, doesn’t address one of the biggest issues facing Android — its security model. Last month, a security researcher discovered a software bug, called Stagefright, that could potentially threaten millions of Android devices. Google acknowledge the bug and sent out a patch to manufacturers and carriers to fix. Then last week, a different security firm found another vulnerability; this one was in Google’s patch. Google said it has since released a fix for that hole, which affects Nexus devices. Still, both findings underscore the nagging headache Google has built with an OS so reliant on hardware partners, many of whom are struggling to maintain profits. And it shows that Google will continue to wrestle with the issues as Android moves onto other devices, like cars, wearables and home automation. “The whole Android ecosystem is a mess,” said Aaron Portnoy, vice president of Exodus Intelligence, the firm that spotted the second hole. The primary issue is that Google is not fully in control of its own destiny, with updates typically needing the okay of device makers and carriers before making their way to consumers, who also have to update their devices. Contrast that with Apple, which is largely able to push updates on its own. The security issues facing Google are reminiscent of those that faced Windows back in the day. The operating system, dominant in the PC world, found itself the increasing center of attacks. Adding to the issue was the fact that businesses were reticent to update their servers and PCs without doing independent testing.AT&T Helped U.S. Spy on Internet on a Vast Scale: The National Security Agency’s ability to spy on vast quantities of Internet traffic passing through the United States has relied on its extraordinary, decades-long partnership with a single company: the telecom giant AT&T.While it has been long known that American telecommunications companies worked closely with the spy agency, newly disclosed N.S.A. documents show that the relationship with AT&T has been considered unique and especially productive. One document described it as “highly collaborative,” while another lauded the company’s “extreme willingness to help.” The N.S.A.’s top-secret budget in 2013 for the AT&T partnership was more than twice that of the next-largest such program, according to the documents. The company installed surveillance equipment in at least 17 of its Internet hubs on American soil, far more than its similarly sized competitor, Verizon. And its engineers were the first to try out new surveillance technologies invented by the eavesdropping agency. One document reminds N.S.A. officials to be polite when visiting AT&T facilities, noting, “This is a partnership, not a contractual relationship.”Samsung Introduces New Phones and Mobile Payments System: The South Korean manufacturer introduced two big-screen Galaxy phones on Thursday: the Note 5, which includes a digital pen, and the S6 Edge Plus, which has a curved screen that wraps around the sides of the phone and skips the pen. The Note 5 is slightly thinner than its predecessor, the Note 4, and has some software twists. For one, you can jot down notes with the pen even when the screen is off. You can also scribble notes on digital documents before sending them. The S6 Edge Plus can be customized so that the curved edges can quickly show your favorite apps or contacts by swiping from the sides. Both phones have 5.7-inch screens and support wireless power charging. While the phones are now available for ordering online, pricing and official release dates have yet to be announced. The new devices follow Samsung’s April release of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, which will soon get price cuts after the company reported earlier this month that its profit had declined for the seventh quarter in a row. Analysts say that Apple‘s introduction last year of big-screen phones, the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as competition from Chinese handset makers like Xiaomi, are chipping into Samsung’s profit. Samsung on Thursday also introduced its mobile wallet system, a rival to the Apple Pay system and Google‘s Android Pay. The new wallet, Samsung Pay, is similar to Apple and Google’s offerings, and will work with a handful of previously released Samsung devices.Apple might be bringing fighter-jet technology to car windshields: The world’s most valuable company is “very likely” working on a 27- to 50-inch head-up display, a technology most famously used by jet pilots, that could project vivid icons and information for drivers while on the road, a tech analyst with Global Equities Research said Thursday morning. The curved-glass screen could also be wired with sensors and “may be completely gesture-controlled,” a stealth project that analyst Trip Chowdhry said could be Apple’s “next generation” device, after gadgets such as the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Rumors about Apple’s secret innovations have become a regular pastime for the many tea-leaf readers of Silicon Valley, and Chowdhry, who seems to be the only analyst so far to suggest Apple is working on a HUD, has been wrong before. But if Apple’s head-up display really is in the works, it could mark a huge leap for the $660 billion gorilla into an industry already packed with big-money carmakers and tech firms, and further embolden the idea that Apple is looking to stake new territory on the world’s roads. Apple’s hiring of auto-industry specialists and sightings in California of Apple-leased camera-mounted vans have fueled rumors that the software-hardware company is looking to build its own kind of car. In February, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal said that hundreds of Apple employees were working on a self-driving minivan, code-named Project Titan.Uber Says Its Chinese Arm Could Eventually Go Public in China: As Uber Technologies raises money from private investors for its Chinese business, the ride-hailing company says the offshoot could one day list shares on the stock market in China. However, Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick is a staunch proponent of companies staying private as long as possible, and the same is true for the Chinese unit, says Nairi Hourdajian, a spokeswoman for the company. “Of course there is the possibility that Uber China, which is a separate entity, could at some point in the future list on the Chinese stock market,” Hourdajian wrote in an e-mail. “But as Travis has always made clear, there are many advantages, for investors, to Uber being a private company, in particular having the freedom to take long-term bets.” The prospect for an Uber China initial public offering has been a hot topic of conversation in the local press recently. Liu Zhen, who heads Uber’s strategy in China, was quoted in the Beijing News as saying the Chinese unit may publicly list in the country. She also said the company—called Youbu, meaning “an excellent step forward”—operates as an independent corporate entity with support from Uber as a strategic investor, according to the report. Kalanick is currently running Uber’s Chinese arm, along with the global business, while the company seeks to hire someone to lead the operation. That person would probably report to Kalanick. The San Francisco company is aiming to raise $1 billion for Uber China at a valuation between $7 billion to $8 billion, two people familiar with the matter said in July. The Chinese search giant Baidu, which is already an investor in Uber, is expected to participate in the round, the people said. Uber is attempting to do what many other American technology companies have failed to do: compete with a homegrown tech company in mainland China. Uber is engaged in an intense fight with Didi Kuaidi, which was recently valued by investors at $15 billion.Online grocer BigBasket raises $50M from Bessemer, others: Online grocery retailer BigBasket.com, has raised $50 million in a fresh round of funding led by existing investor Bessemer Venture Partners. The Times of India, which first reported the development citing BigBasket CEO Hari Menon, said BigBasket has also mandated Citigroup to raise $150 million (Rs 950 crore) from new investors. The new round of funding, which values BigBasket at $1 billion, will power the company’s plans to enter 50 more Tier-II cities, the report said. BigBasket.com is an online grocery store with operations in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Delhi-NCR and Mysore. It was founded by a team of five in 2011. The team has both offline and online retail experience, as it had earlier set up India’s first e-commerce site FabMart.com in 1999, and then established the Fabmall-Trinethra chain of more than 200 grocery supermarket stores in southern India. Trinethra was sold to Aditya Birla Group in 2006 and currently operates under the brand name ‘More’. The startup has investments from Bessemer Venture Partners, Helion Venture Partners and Zodius Capital. It was valued at Rs 1,400 crore when it last raised funds in January. The company is understood to have closed fiscal 2015 with a top-line of Rs 250 crore and a run-rate of 6,000 orders a day with average billing of Rs 1,500 per customer.Big Changes at Google: Major Restructuring and a New Holding Company Named 'Alphabet'; Shares Rise 6%: Google is listening to Wall Street, while also trying to keep its innovation going. The Silicon Valley behemoth is reorganizing under a new name — Alphabet — and separating its moneymaking businesses from the moonshot ones. Under the new structure, Mr. Page is to run Alphabet along with Sergey Brin, who co-founded the web search business with him in 1998. Alphabet would be the parent entity, housing several companies, with the biggest among them Google. In addition, the portfolio would include Nest, the smart thermostat maker, and Calico, a company focused on longevity, among other things. Sundar Pichai, who had been senior vice president in charge of products, will be chief executive of Google, which will encompass Internet such products as search, maps, YouTube and applications like Gmail. Mr. Pichai will add YouTube to his list of products. The YouTube chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, will now report to him, whereas she previously reported to Mr. Page. In addition, Mr. Pichai will oversee the business operations for Google. Google’s current business chief, Omid Kordestani, will end that role and become an adviser to Alphabet and Google. Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Google, will remain in that position and will also be chief financial officer for Alphabet. Other entities under Alphabet will include Google Fiber, a provider of ultrafast Internet service. There will also be two financial businesses, Google Ventures, the venture capital arm, and Capital, which does private-equity-like deals. Google X, which includes projects like self-driving cars, a drone delivery service and an attempt to make Internet-connected balloons, will be managed separately and run by Mr. Brin.A holding company structure also gives Mr. Page and Mr. Brin, who became multibillionaires when Google went public in 2004, room to make big new bets to add to Alphabet’s portfolio — without annoying Wall Street. Over the last few years, investors have expressed concern that Google has become distracted from its core web search, instead pursuing projects fancied by its founders, like self-driving cars or a pill to detect cancer. The holding-company structure is set to provide more financial transparency. Starting in the fourth quarter of this year, Alphabet will break out financial results for Google Inc., as well as for the overall company. While investors will not be able to see individual results for other companies, the system will make it easier to get a sense of how Google’s core business is doing.Xiaomi Plans to Have India Smartphone Lineup Produced Locally (By FoxConn): Foxconn has begun assembling Xiaomi’s first made-in-India smartphone from a new plant in the country’s south, helping the Chinese company shorten delivery times and prop up margins. Xiaomi, the world’s fourth-largest phone vendor, will source “100 percent” of Redmi 2 Prime devices sold in India from Foxconn’s new factory in Sri City, Hugo Barra, vice president of global operations, said by phone on Sunday. The Redmi 2 Prime went on sale online Monday, at $110 for a 2GB model. “We are starting small; but our eventual aim is to make most of our devices if not all of our devices that are sold in India, manufacture them here,” said Manu Jain, Xiaomi’s India head. “The entire ecosystem needs to exist before we start manufacturing the phone from scratch. This will probably take some time,” he said. Foxconn had begun production of smartphones at the Sri City factory, a person familiar with the matter said in July. The Taiwanese company, a contract manufacturer for the world’s largest electronics brands including Apple Inc., is looking to expand in the South Asian country amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make in India campaign aimed at creating jobs and accelerating economic growth. Assembling locally will help Xiaomi shore up margins and take advantage of tax breaks in its largest market outside of China. As low-end smartphone sales slow in its home country, Xiaomi is depending on other emerging markets for growth.Taiwan's Foxconn plans $5 billion investment over five years in Indian facility: Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and a key supplier to Apple, on Saturday signed a pact with India's Maharashtra state to invest $5 billion over five years on a new electronics manufacturing facility. The announcement was made by Foxconn founder Terry Gou and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis after the signing of an accord in the state capital Mumbai. The Foxconn announcement will bolster Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's \"Make in India\" campaign, which aims to turn Asia's third-largest economy into a manufacturing powerhouse. Gou said Foxconn, the trade name for Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd which also counts Blackberry, Xiaomi and Amazon as clients, was looking for local partners for the facility in the western Indian state. He declined to say if the Taiwan-based company would make mobile phones at the facility. On Tuesday, Gou said in New Delhi that he was looking at setting up manufacturing units in various Indian states and possible partnerships in the world's fastest growing smartphone market. He had said in May that Foxconn was aiming to develop 10-12 facilities in India, including factories and data centers, by 2020.Insight: Tesla burns cash, loses more than $4,000 on every car sold: The Silicon Valley automaker is losing more than $4,000 on every Model S electric sedan it sells, using its reckoning of operating losses, and it burned $359 million in cash last quarter in a bull market for luxury vehicles. The company on Wednesday cut its production targets for this year and next. Chief Executive Elon Musk said he's considering options to raise more capital, and didn't rule out selling more stock. Musk has taken investors on a thrill ride since taking Tesla public in 2010. Now he's given himself a deadline, promising that by the first quarter of 2016 Tesla will be making enough money to fund a jump from making one expensive, low volume car to mass producing multiple models, and expanding a venture to manufacture electric power storage systems. Tesla's shares fell almost 9 percent on Thursday and slipped another 2 percent on Friday as investors and analysts weighed the risks of Musk's ambitious plans for expanding Tesla's auto and energy storage businesses. Tesla had just $1.15 billion on hand as of June 30, down from $2.67 billion a year earlier. Barclays analyst Brian Johnson disagreed with the company's estimates, and said he expects Tesla's capital spending will go up in 2016 and 2017 as the company ramps up its battery factory and Model 3 development. \"Their small scale means the cash generation is not as great as they might have hoped for,\" he said. Musk said this week Tesla expects to have $1 billion in cash over the next year, and told analysts \"there may be some value\" in raising capital \"as a risk reduction measure.\" Tesla's stock is still about 70 percent higher than it was two years ago, and 8 percent ahead of its level on Jan 1. With a market capitalization of $31 billion, Tesla is worth more than Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, the much larger maker of Ram pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees. \"A capital raise, given the way they're burning cash today, given the fact that they have future investment needs, seems very likely at some point,\" said UBS Securities analyst Colin Langan, who has a sell rating on the stock.Raising Money Is Like Buying Dinner, Spending Money Is Like Getting Fat: How A Big Round Can Hurt Your Startup: When you’re a struggling team eating away at your meager savings and trying to get your startup profitable, venture capital funding seems like the holy grail. Raising money from investors gives you the resources to grow your team, buys you time to do things properly and gives you no small amount of credibility in the eyes of other entrepreneurs, prospective hires and even some clients — not to mention mom and dad thinking you’re now successful. While all of this is true, there’s a pervasive belief in the industry that entrepreneurs should aim to raise as much money as possible, as often as possible. It might be true in some circumstances, but here are three reasons why raising as much money as possible is often not in the best interest of the entrepreneur or the company. Raising Money Is Like Buying Dinner, Spending Money Is Like Getting Fat, and Raising Big Rounds Is Like Stunt Driving. In the end, it’s most important as an entrepreneur that you focus on the right decisions for your company. Don’t raise funds to get a big splash in the tech press. Don’t push for the biggest valuation to please preferred stockholders. And don’t optimize for the fanciest publications or the most street cred. All of those things are fleeting sugar highs of entrepreneurship. Plan for the long-term success of your company by knowing how much you actually need and stopping once you hit that number.As private and public multiples diverge sharply, some investors bet on public companies : Airbnb’s valuation has ballooned over the last few years as large financial firms like Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price have rushed to invest in the start-up. But a small San Francisco-based hedge fund called Pier 88 Investment Partners has decided that the fervor for Airbnb shares creates a different kind of opportunity. While other investors paid dearly to buy a piece of Airbnb — the start-up’s latest funding round valued it at $24 billion — Pier 88 did not invest directly in the privately held online home-rental company. Instead, Pier 88 put money into HomeAway, a publicly traded Internet company that competes with Airbnb, but has a market capitalization of just $2.95 billion. Frank Timons and LeAnne Schweitzer, the co-founders of Pier 88, believe there is money to be made on this big gap between public and private company valuations. In their view, the public companies are such relative bargains that they will make great acquisitions for purchasers that want to better compete with upstarts like Airbnb. Then, when those publicly traded companies are snapped up — often for a premium of more than 50 percent — Pier 88 can profit from the bet. Some elite start-ups are now vastly more expensive than their publicly traded cousins. Apart from Airbnb being pegged at eight times the value of HomeAway, the ride-hailing start-up Uber was recently valued at around $51 billion, compared with $7.3 billion for the rental-car company Hertz. The storage start-up Dropbox has a valuation of around $10 billion, while its publicly traded rival Box has a $1.9 billion market capitalization. It’s not perfectly accurate to directly compare market capitalization and private company valuations, since private companies keep their true financial pictures hidden. Still, “the easy private financing environment has created an interesting trade opportunity,” said Kenneth J. Heinz, the president of Hedge Fund Research, which tracks hedge funds and their performance. “With such a disparity between public and private multiples, it’s a reasonable fundamental approach to believe that in this environment, the public company valuation will come up or the company will be acquired.”Practo raises $90M from China’s Tencent, Sofina, Google Capital, Yuri Milner, others: Practo, a web-based clinic management software developer and medicare listings provider, has raised $90 million in Series C funding led by Chinese media and technology conglomerate Tencent Holdings. Marquee institutional investors such as Sofina, Sequoia India, Google Capital, Altimeter Capital, Matrix Partners, Sequoia Capital Global Equities and Russian investor Yuri Milner also put money in this round, as per a press statement. Practo will use the money to expand product lines, acquire more startups and enhance headcount. “We are hard at work building a single health app that helps people live healthier by making better healthcare decisions for themselves and their loved ones. We are excited to partner with some of the best investors on the planet. Our global partners will give us the edge to continue building global healthcare products that our users love,” said Shashank ND, founder and CEO of Practo. A few months ago, Practo had raised $30 million in Series B round from Sequoia India and Matrix Partners. Three years ago, it had raised $4.6 million from Sequoia Capital in Series A funding. Recently, Practo acquired product outsourcing firm Genii Technologies Pvt Ltd for its capabilities in building bespoke e-commerce portals and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms. Practo offers services like helping patients find relevant doctors online, compare them and schedule appointments. It also sells PractoRay under a SaaS model for primary clinics, which enables doctors to schedule and manage patient records. Practo already lists over 8,000 hospitals on its platform and will expand this to over 20,000 by end of this year. Recently, it launched a new feature that allows users to find diagnostic labs in their vicinity. It competes with the likes of Lybrate, HelpingDoc, Praxify and AllizHealth.Tesla Plunges 9% as Musk Grapples With SUV’s Second-Row Seats: Elon Musk can’t make an SUV without seats. Tesla’s chief executive officer dialed back his forecast for 2015 vehicle deliveries, saying that getting the new sport utility vehicle’s middle-row seats just right is proving thornier than expected. The added threat of not having enough of other interior parts puts the original sales plan at risk, he said. “Our biggest challenges are with the second-row seat,” Musk said Wednesday during a conference call with analysts. “It’s an amazing seat, a sculptural work of art, but a very tricky thing to get right.” He added that some interior trim components could become roadblocks, but the so-called falcon-wing doors weren’t going to be a problem. Assembly snags on the Model X, Tesla Motors Inc.’s first SUV, could also slow output of the Model S sedan, Musk said. So now the company may deliver 50,000 to 55,000 autos in 2015, down from an initial target of 55,000. Tesla shares fell 8.9 percent to $246.13 at the close Thursday after plunging as much as 13 percent for the biggest intraday decline in 21 months. While lowering the bar for this year and next, Musk said he remains “confident” that Tesla will produce about half a million cars in 2020. He’s said that’s when investors should be able to expect the company to become profitable. Musk pointed out Tesla made 600 cars annually five years ago. “Now we can produce 600 cars in three days,” he said. As production of the SUV increases, the company will become free cash-flow positive, probably near the end of this year and “certainly” for the first quarter of 2016, Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja said. Tesla has drawn down $50 million of a $750 million credit line, and left open the possibility of going to Wall Street for additional money.Apple Music attracts more than 11 million trial members: Apple said on Thursday its new music streaming service has attracted more than 11 million members during its free trial period, a response that music industry experts called respectable but not overwhelming. Apple Music rolled out with a three-month free trial period on June 30. Nearly 2 million people opted for the free trial family plan, which will cost $14.99 a month for up to six family members, the company said. The service costs $9.99 a month for individuals. Apple’s iTunes Store helped revitalize the music industry a decade ago, but digital downloads have slumped in recent years amid a shift toward streaming. Unlike popular streaming services from rivals such as Spotify, Apple’s offering does not include a free on-demand tier, a decision praised by some in the music industry. Apple shares were down 4 cents at $114.84 in early afternoon. Based on typical conversion rates in the industry, it would be impressive if Apple convinced 20 percent of the trial members to become paying subscribers after the free trial ends, he added. Spotify has more than 20 million paid subscribers worldwide, the company has told Reuters.Apple Denies Planning to Sell Mobile Services Directly to Consumers: Apple, the world’s most profitable mobile phone maker, has denied a report that it is working on a plan to market communications services directly to consumers that would bypass telecom operators on which it now relies. Business Insider on Monday reported that the iPhone maker was testing a so-called mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) service in the United States, which would involve it renting capacity from one or more network operators to sign up its own customers. The mobile phone maker is also in talks with European operators about such an arrangement, the website reported. “We have not discussed nor do we have any plans to launch an MVNO,” said an Apple spokeswoman in a statement on Tuesday.Hackers Exploit ‘Flash’ Vulnerability in Yahoo Ads: For seven days, hackers used Yahoo’s ad network to send malicious bits of code to computers that visit Yahoo’s collection of heavily trafficked websites, the company said on Monday. The attack, which started on July 28, was the latest in a string that have exploited Internet advertising networks, which are designed to reach millions of people online. It also highlighted growing anxiety over a much-used graphics program called Adobe Flash, which has a history of security issues that have irked developers at Silicon Valley companies. “Right now, the bad guys are really enjoying this,” said Jérôme Segura, a security researcher at Malwarebytes, the security company that uncovered the attack. “Flash for them was a godsend.” The scheme, which Yahoo shut down on Monday, worked like this: A group of hackers bought ads across the Internet giant’s sports, news and finance sites. When a computer — in this case, one running Windows — visited a Yahoo site, it downloaded malware code. From there, the malware hunted for an out-of-date version of Adobe Flash, which it could use to commandeer the computer — either holding it for ransom until the hackers were paid off or discreetly directing its browser to websites that paid the hackers for traffic.Apple Doing Own Cellular Service Doesn’t Make Sense, at Least Not Today: The appeal is tempting, of course. Apple would then fully own the relationship with the customer rather than leaving that job to one of the “orifices,” as Steve Jobs famously labeled the wireless providers. Google is in fact doing just this with its Google Fi effort, where it offers service starting at $20 per month using the networks of both Sprint and T-Mobile. But the service is fairly limited. It’s offered only on a single Nexus 6 phone and its designed to keep the service more of a test than a true national rival. It doesn’t make sense for Apple for a number of reasons. First it has a tough time doing things small — Apple currently represents a huge part of the carriers’ business, and some of the carriers’ most lucrative customers are its iPhone owners. So the carriers aren’t going to be eager to hand that over to Apple. Even if Apple could convince them to do so, it might not be in Apple’s long-term interest. First of all, consumers today are benefitting from four carriers heavily competing against one another, with a resurgent T-Mobile and an increasingly desperate Sprint both putting price pressure on AT&T and Verizon. Also, carriers spend a fortune to keep their networks strong enough to handle increasing demands and to swiftly upgrade to faster technologies. If they become truly a dumb pipe just selling gigabytes to Apple, the incentive to differentiate on customer service or speed is reduced, as would be the amount of capital they would have to invest. Over time, that could mean both Apple and consumers would lose. Plus, if it is Apple’s name attached to the service, it would have to take on the role of customer support and the perceived blame when the service doesn’t meet customer expectations. “That’s a lot to bite off, and I can’t see Apple wanting to do it,” said Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson. Now, that doesn’t mean Apple isn’t interested in seeing more value come to it over time. With iMessage, for example, Apple took something that consumers value — their text messages — and made it a feature of their phone rather than something tied to their carrier and phone number. There are reports Apple would like to do the same thing with voicemail. Apple also introduced on the latest iPads a SIM card that works across different cellular networks so customers don’t have to choose a carrier when choosing a device. Apple could do something similar with the next iPhone. These moves make sense. Whether Apple has dreams of eventually offering cell service or not, it is to their advantage that consumers are more tied to their iPhone than they are to being a customer of AT & T or T-Mobile. Do such moves also open the door to Apple offering its own cell service some day? Sure. And it would be foolish for Apple not to constantly consider whether such a move makes sense. But, at least for now, the downsides likely outweigh the benefits.Apple Falls Below Its 200-Day Moving Average for First Time Since 2013: The bull market’s base just lost another brick. Amid a collapse in breadth and the threat of falling earnings, add a correction in Apple shares to the concerns facing investors. The iPhone maker slipped 2.4 percent to $118.44 today, extending its decline since February to 11 percent and dropping below another chart threshold, its 200-day moving average, for the first time since 2013. The iPhone maker’s shares had spent 471 sessions above the 200-day threshold, last falling below it in September 2013. It entered a correction territory today after coming within 40 cents of one on July 9 before rallying.German Carmakers Buy Nokia’s Here Mapping Unit for $3 Billion: Nokia said that it had sold its Here digital mapping unit to a consortium of German automakers for 2.8 billion euros, or about $3 billion. The announcement signals the latest chapter in Nokia’s transformation, as the company tries to rebound from the demise of its once world-leading mobile phone unit, which was sold to Microsoft last year for about $7.6 billion. As part of the changes, the Finnish company has pared its operations to focus almost entirely on its telecom network infrastructure business, which provides communications equipment to some of the world’s largest carriers. The members of the German consortium said that they would use Nokia’s digital mapping unit for their own autonomous driving plans, but that they would be willing to license the technology to other companies. The sale of Nokia’s mapping unit comes as the Finnish company is close to completing its $16.6 billion acquisition of the French-American telecom equipment maker Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia has received regulatory approval from United States and European antitrust authorities for that deal, but it is still waiting for the go-ahead from Chinese officials. By agreeing to a sale price of roughly $3 billion, the Finnish company is essentially writing off years of research and development, and a series of multibillion acquisitions that had turned Here into a global mapping champion. Those deals include the $8.1 billion purchase in 2007 of Navteq, the maker of digital mapping and navigational software based in Chicago, as Nokia tried to keep pace with other handset makers and mobile operating systems. As digital maps are becoming a crucial focal point of many emerging industries, a number of bidders had expressed interest in Here, including the ride-booking service Uber, which submitted a $3 billion bid for the business before dropping out last month. Other tech giants, including Amazon, the Chinese search engine Baidu and Facebook, also rely on Nokia’s geospatial data for their mapping services. These companies had turned to Here to reduce their reliance on Google — a company that they increasingly compete with for users, engineers and advertising revenue. It will now be up to the German automakers to convince these tech companies that they can continue to offer the same level of digital mapping services that had made Nokia’s unit the main global rival to Google Maps.Microsoft Said to Invest Big Sum in Uber; Latest Round Values Firm at $51 Billion: Microsoft has agreed to invest in Uber, according to people with knowledge of the matter, as part of a funding round that values the ride-hailing company at around $51 billion. If the deal is finalized, Microsoft’s contribution would be a substantial amount of the financing, which totals about $1 billion, according to the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details of the fund-raising are not public. This new round cements Uber’s place as one of the most richly valued private companies ever, along with other start-ups like Xiaomi, the Chinese electronics company valued by investors at around $45 billion, and Airbnb, the short-term lodging service valued at more than $24 billion. It is also the latest fund-raising spree undertaken by Uber, which has added billions of dollars to its surging war chest. Uber has earmarked significant money for expansion into new markets like China, India and greater Southeast Asia. On Thursday, an Uber representative said the company had set aside $1 billion to spur growth specifically in India, where the company has faced stiff competition from local ride-hailing services. Uber has a history of bringing in important partners during funding rounds. In December, Baidu, the Chinese search giant, invested hundreds of millions in Uber. And in March, Times Internet, the digital venture of the Times of India Group media conglomerate, said it had agreed to a strategic investment in Uber.India’s Snapdeal, an Amazon Competitor, Raises $500 Million From Alibaba, Foxconn and SoftBank: Alibaba finally has its ally in India, perhaps the world’s hottest e-commerce market. The Chinese e-commerce giant has invested in Snapdeal, an India-based e-commerce startup, as part of a $500 million round, according to multiple sources. Foxconn, the Taiwanese company best known as a manufacturer of Apple’s iPhones, also invested, alongside existing Snapdeal investor SoftBank. Snapdeal had previously raised more than $1 billion from investors including SoftBank, eBay, BlackRock, Bessemer Ventures and Indian venture firms such as Kalaari Capital and Nexus Venture Partners. Alibaba and Foxconn were considering the investment earlier this year, which would value Snapdeal at $5 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported in June. The company has undergone several iterations since Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal founded it in 2010, including one as a Groupon clone. Today, it’s an online shopping marketplace that sells a wide range of products, from cameras to jeans to toys — pitting it against Flipkart, a homegrown competitor currently valued at around $15 billion, and Amazon, which is investing billions of dollars into its Indian business. In the past year, Snapdeal has started to develop an ecosystem of sites by acquiring companies focused on different areas of online commerce. It bought FreeCharge, a popular service in India that allows people to add money to prepaid phone plans and prepaid TV plans. It also acquired RupeePower, a comparison shopping site for credit cards and loans. The approach is not all that different from Alibaba’s, which runs a host of different marketplaces focused on different types of buyers and different regions. While Flipkart has more market share in India, Snapdeal CEO Bahl thinks that company and Amazon are thinking too narrowly by being focused mainly on the sale of physical products, he told Re/code during an interview at Snapdeal’s Indian headquarters in April. Snapdeal, on the other hand, is going after what Bahl believes will eventually be a $250 billion opportunity — bringing all kinds of other transactions online in addition to the sale of products. “What’s the delta between retail and consumption?” Bahl asked rhetorically, referring to the difference between the two. “It’s things like financial services, education, utilities, health care. But today, all everyone is doing is products.” “Others are building aircraft carriers,” he added. “We are building an army of speedboats.”Why Some Start-Ups Are Called Tech Companies and Others Are Not: these days, every company is at least a little bit of a tech company. Some Wall Street banks employ more tech workers than all but the biggest Silicon Valley companies. And large manufacturers like General Electric are leading the way in efforts to put Internet-connected sensors on things as varied as streets and turbines. So why then are some start-ups called tech companies and others just … companies? “Tech means more than just producing hardware or software,” said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “It is synonymous with innovation, research and development, long-term thinking.” The label is a signal that “you want to work for me. You want to buy things from me at a higher price. You want to give me capital at a lower cost,” Mr. Zandi said. It is difficult to say what the financial windfall of the tech label is to today’s start-ups since most of them are still private companies, though no doubt they benefit from being close to the tech industry’s deep-pocketed financiers. But toward the end of the dot-com boom at the turn of the century, Raghavendra Rau, now a professor of finance at the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, was the co-author of a study that documented the temporary surge in the stock prices of companies that added the dot-com suffix to their names. Those temporary dot-coms took advantage of an investor behavior called “categorization,” said Mr. Rau. Categorization helps us understand something if we’re not familiar with it. “We build up a story in our heads on what we think we are going to see,” he said. “Even if the firm has no cash flows or no profits, we think we know what the story is. And firms are good at seeing what is popular and trying to fit in with that mental map.” Today’s happy adopters of the tech label, however, should note the follow-up research by Mr. Rau and his co-authors after the dot-com bubble popped early last decade. He found that double-switchers — companies that added and later dropped their dot-com identity — saw their stock prices over one month move 38.5 percent ahead of companies that kept the dot-com name. In a few years, maybe being labeled a logistics company won’t be such a bad thing.Yahoo to Acquire Polyvore in Shopping-Advertising Push: Yahoo is buying shopping-service Polyvore Inc., seeking to improve its online fashion content and boost shopping-related advertising. Polyvore, which combines social and e-commerce tools for apparel and accessories, will initially be integrated into Yahoo’s magazines that focus on beauty and style, according to Simon Khalaf, senior vice president at Yahoo. Terms of the deal, subject to customary closing conditions, weren’t disclosed in a statement Friday by the companies. Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer is pushing to add more news, entertainment and shopping information to the Web portal in order to draw a bigger audience and sell advertising. Polyvore lets users put together themed collections of items, like those seen in fashion magazines. People can browse through the collections and then buy the items. Polyvore will add more than 350 retailers to Yahoo’s advertising platform, the companies said.Uber to invest $1 billion in India: FT: Online ride hailing service Uber is set to invest $1 billion in India, which will bring its investment on par with that in China, the Financial Times reported. Uber said that this move would help its service reach 1 million daily rides by March 2016, the first time the company has set such target for India, FT said. Amit Jain, president of Uber India, said the company was \"extremely bullish\" on the Indian market and that it continues to see a 40 percent monthly growth, FT reported. Jain also added that the company will expand service beyond the 18 cities in which it operates, the largest number in any country outside of the United States. On Wednesday, Uber launched its own auto leasing subsidiary in an effort to sign up more drivers, injecting the fast-growing ride services company directly into the financial services sector for the first time.In rural China, shoppers go online - with a little help: Cheng Yonghao left his village in central Henan province almost 20 years ago, not expecting to return. He's now back home, and this week opened a village store to help locals shop online. Cheng is just one of an army of local recruits who are part of Alibaba Group's big bet on rural e-commerce as China's internet giants invest billions in outpost service hubs to tap a market twice the size of the United States. E-commerce growth in the countryside now outpaces that in major cities, though fewer than one tenth of online purchases made on Alibaba platforms were shipped to rural areas in the first quarter of this year. Alibaba estimates the potential market at 460 billion yuan ($74 billion) by next year. Rival JD.com also says that developing rural e-commerce is a key strategy this year. While the rewards are enticing, few are making money yet. \"We don't know when our rural e-commerce operations will become profitable, but there's value in what we're doing, there's consumer demand,\" Gao Hongbing, director of Alibaba's research arm, told reporters earlier this month. Before it can reap the rewards, Alibaba is having to teach a rural population - which tends to be older, poorer and less comfortable with technology - how to browse and buy. Alibaba has been on a recruitment drive to find and train local 'partners', who set up service centers in their home villages, helping locals shop online. Partners - mostly younger, educated, and more familiar with navigating websites like Taobao, Alibaba's online emporium - go through a written exam, computer test and interview. More than 1,000 applied for one batch of 50 jobs, said one applicant from Henan. Training takes place at local government business offices over 2-3 days in groups of around four dozen. Trainees are asked about their aspirations and how they can reach their potential.Archived snippets are here      FaSteep Discounts a Boon for Customers, but a Gamble for Start-Upsh: Jet.com, a well-funded new shopping site, opened to the public last week and celebrated the debut by sending reporters a big box of swag. I got a T-shirt with a company logo, fuzzy socks, stickers and $1,400 in oversize, fake $100 bills. Jet is a discount site, so I suspect the funny money was meant to illustrate the cash I’d save by shopping there. But the faux bills immediately evoked a more cautious reminder — of all the money Jet plans to spend to become the next force in online shopping. It isn’t just Jet. On a venture-capital high, tech start-ups are burning through vast cash reserves to offer rock-bottom prices, and to sign up new customers with discounts, giveaways and other deals that may sound too good to be true. Jet, a Costco-like members-only discount company that has raised more than $225 million from investors before opening its doors, is only the largest such example. Forget the fake bills; for Jet, as well as for many of its smaller start-up kin, giving away real money is a key part of business. This sounds fishy. But there’s an upside: While investors’ cash lasts, consumers could be in for a boon. After all, from the perspective of customers, what’s so bad about companies giving away their venture-funneled cash? Jet’s prices may be the most ambitious. In May, I found the company was vastly undercutting Amazon, and The Wall Street Journal recently ordered a basket of goods from the site for which it calculated that Jet lost nearly $243 on a single order. In an interview, Mr. Lore was unfazed by these numbers, because, he said, they were already built into his projections. “We understand really well what these costs are now and how they’ll come down over time, and it’s simply a matter of understanding how much capital it’s going to take,” he said. In fact, he added, losing money on each order isn’t his biggest worry; instead, it’s failing to draw enough orders to get to scale. “The hard part is, can you get to $20 billion in five years?” The only way to get there, Mr. Lore said, is to keep spending. Whether or not he’s right, enjoy it.E-commerce firms boost Indian postal department revenues: With e-commerce platforms increasingly turning to the Indian Posts to deliver their orders to customers, the fast flourishing e-retail business has become a revenue generator for the state-run agency, whose traditional operations are dented by the deep penetration of e-mail and mobile phones. Realising the potential, the Postal Department has set up a dedicated e-commerce and parcel processing center in the country’s commercial hub Mumbai. Spread across 12,000 sq ft, the facility at Parel in the city has bagged good business in a short span, handling around 5,000 orders a day. The department officials expect at this pace the traffic would soon increase to 10,000 parcels per day. The facility has a capacity to process 30,000 parcels per day.Google Loon To Cover Entire Country Of Sri Lanka With Internet: Google is working on many things, and that includes balloons that fly high in the sky to bring Internet infrastructure to locations that can’t be wired for it easily. Today, Sri Lanka announced that it’s the first country to ever get universal Internet access from Google’s Project Loon. Thanks to a partnership with Google, the country promises “affordable high-speed Internet” for all of its residents. Google Loon was announced in 2013, with only incremental and anecdotal information hitting the presses up until now. This is a landmark moment for Loon, and clearly for Sri Lanka.GitHub Raises $250M Series B Round To Take Risks: GitHub, the software development collaboration and version control service based on the popular open source Git tool, today announced that it has raised a $250 million funding round led by Sequoia Capital. Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital and Institutional Venture Partners also participated in this round. The company, which was founded back in 2008, has now taken a total of $350 million in outside funding. While the company isn’t talking about its valuation, the WSJ reports that it’s currently hovering around $2 billion. GitHub’s 2012 Series A round was led by Andreessen Horowitz. At the time, the company’s valuation was said to be around $750 million. As GitHub CEO and co-founder Chris Wanstrath told me shortly after the new round was announced, the company plans to use this new round to accelerate growth and expand its sales and engineering team (as most companies do when they raise). He also stressed, though, that the round isn’t just meant for that. “The round is not just to accelerate, but also to allow us to think bigger and take larger risks,” Wanstrath said. This means GitHub acquisitions are likely on the horizon, but he also noted that the company wants to push its international strategy forward. It recently opened an office in Japan (and hosted its first meetup there) and other locations will likely follow. There can be no doubt that Git has become something of a de facto version control system for many startups and GitHub currently leads the charge among companies that essentially offer Git as a service. Atlassian, Microsoft, GitLab and others offer similar services, both cloud-hosted and on premise, but GitHub has clearly attracted most of the mindshare in recent years. GitHub says it currently has about 10 million users who are in collaboration on over 25 million projects (that’s up from 10 million in January 2014). Given that the company offers free accounts, it’s not clear how many of these users are actually paying for the service, though (pricing starts at $5/month).Caller ID App Truecaller Is Raising $100M At A $1B Valuation; India Is Its Biggest Market: Communications apps that strike a chord with users across different markets are hot property these days, and it looks like another one of them may soon enter the so-called unicorn club. TechCrunch has learned that Truecaller — a caller ID app that now has 150 million users — is looking to raise around $100 million at a $1 billion valuation. We’re hearing that Truecaller has hired Morgan Stanley to lead the process, and there are term sheets out. The round is likely to have previous and new investors. To date, True Software, maker of Truecaller, has raised around $80 million. Previous investors include Atomico, Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, Sequoia Capital, Access Partners and Open Ocean. The plan will be to use the funds to grow the product. Truecaller, founded in Sweden, has seen a lot of traction in markets like India, its biggest market at 80 million users. Now it wants to expand elsewhere, like the U.S., and will be building out the company’s office in the Bay Area. The company is projected to hit 300 million users this year. Truecaller works by aggregating directory services via deals with white pages companies, and platforms like Yelp to bring in businesses. It complements this with crowdsourced information from the app’s users. That includes accessing your own address book, although you can opt out. Individual users can also opt out from being listed. It then uses big data analytics and machine learning to offer additional services beyond caller ID such as predicting who you might want to call next based on where you are and what time of day it is, or what the top-reported spam number is in your area at the moment. Other features include spam blocking, directory services and “smart” SMS services. The company makes revenues through in-app purchases for premium features, as well as advertising within the app. The company’s country manager for India has also reportedly said that Truecaller may launch a paid version by the end of this year.Archived snippets are here, and MP3 versions are hereStripe, Digital Payments Start-Up, Raises New Funding and Partners With Visa: Stripe is gaining more financial allies to help it take on the digital payments industry. The start-up, based in San Francisco, said on Tuesday that it had raised new funding from investors like Visa, American Express and Sequoia Capital, among others, valuing the young company at $5 billion. That is a significant jump for Stripe, coming roughly six months after it garnered $70 million at a $3.5 billion valuation. Stripe declined to disclose the amount of new funding, except to say it was “less than $100 million.” Founded five years ago, Stripe has quickly gained traction by offering simple software and services for online small and medium-size businesses. Similar to Square and PayPal, Stripe accepts credit and debit cards for merchants who have not taken them previously. Stripe charges a small fee per transaction. On Tuesday Stripe also announced a partnership with Visa, one of the world’s largest credit card companies, in which the two will work on ways to improve digital transactions. The companies said they expected to collaborate on initiatives like payments security, as well as software like website “buy buttons.” Stripe said it would rely on Visa’s global footprint to expand its international availability. Stripe is currently available to businesses in more than 25 countries, and hopes to expand further with help from Visa. That Visa is partnering with Stripe instead of a larger payments processor is something of a coup for the start-up. Visa has become increasingly wary of other payments companies, such as PayPal, which processed more than $220 billion in online transactions last year and this month was spun off from its onetime parent, eBay. While PayPal has handled online credit transactions since the early days of e-commerce, Visa said it became concerned by PayPal’s ability to siphon customer relationships away from card companies and steer customers to debit transactions, in which PayPal sees healthier profit margins.Archived snippets are here, and MP3 versions are hereAlibaba Appoints Tsai to Lead Board at New Local Services Unit Koubei: Alibaba Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai will head up the board at Koubei, underscoring the strategic importance of a new business unit that will spearhead the e-commerce company’s drive into the local services market. Tsai’s new responsibilities as Koubei’s chairman come on top of his current role as the number two executive at Alibaba, the company said in an email confirming his appointment on Monday. Alibaba executives have stressed the importance of establishing a foothold beyond e-commerce in what they call an “online to offline” market, which refers to the increasing use of mobile devices to buy physical goods and services. Tsai joined Alibaba in 1999 and he helped transform Alibaba into a global powerhouse, leading negotiations on dozens of acquisitions and early financing rounds, including with SoftBank Corp. Koubei, a joint venture set up by Alibaba and its financial services affiliate, is competing with Baidu and Tencent in a market for local services that’s expected to reach 7.28 trillion yuan ($1.17 trillion) by 2017. Local services is a key area of contention for Chinese Internet companies as people turn to the web to order take-out, beauty treatments and domestic helpers. Chinese users of location-based services could rise 29 percent to 400 million people in 2017 compared with this year, according to a research report by Shanghai-based Internet consultant IResearch. Baidu said in June it would invest 20 billion yuan in three years to expand its own location-based services platform, called Nuomi. And group discount website Meituan.com, which is also competing in the same field, raised $700 million in January this year to fund expansion.Pepperfry raises $100M from Goldman Sachs, Zodius, others: Mumbai-based Pepperfry.com, an e-commerce marketplace for furniture, home decor and appliances, has secured $100 million in funding from Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Zodius Technology Fund. The company’s existing investors Norwest Venture Partners and Bertelsmann India Investments have also participated in this round of funding, according to its founder and CEO Ambareesh Murthy. TrendSutra Platform Services Pvt Ltd, the company behind Pepperfry.com, will use the money to expand its logistics footprint in over 300 towns and for ‘quadrupling’ the size of its technology team, Murthy told Techcircle.in. The company will also use the funds to add new ‘experience centres’ and for upping digital marketing spend. Avendus Capital was the exclusive financial advisor to Pepperfry for this round of funding. Started in January 2012 with categories like home, lifestyle, fashion and more, Pepperfry now specialises in furniture and home products on its managed marketplace platform. The company not only markets furniture and home decor products through its site, but also employs carpenters and operates a fleet of over 350 delivery vehicles. Prior to the latest transaction, Pepperfry had bagged close to $30 million in funding. Pepperfry is expected to have crossed Rs 500 crore in GMV this year.Archived snippets are here, and MP3 versions are hereUsing Algorithms to Determine Character: A company in Palo Alto, Calif., called Upstart has over the last 15 months lent $135 million to people with mostly negligible credit ratings. Typically, they are recent graduates without mortgages, car payments or credit card settlements. Those are among the things that normally earn a good or bad credit score, but these people haven’t been in the working world that long. So Upstart looks at their SAT scores, what colleges they attended, their majors and their grade-point averages. As much as job prospects, the company is assessing personality. “If you take two people with the same job and circumstances, like whether they have kids, five years later the one who had the higher G.P.A. is more likely to pay a debt,” said Paul Gu, Upstart’s co-founder and head of product. “It’s not whether you can pay. It’s a question of how important you see your obligation.” The idea, validated by data, is that people who did things like double-checking the homework or studying extra in case there was a pop quiz are thorough and likely to honor their debts. Analytics, meet judgment of people. “I guess you could call it character, though we haven’t used that label,” said Mr. Gu, who is 24. The same personality dynamic holds for people go to great schools or have top grades. Douglas Merrill, the founder and chief executive of ZestFinance, is a former Google executive whose company writes loans to subprime borrowers through nonstandard data signals. One signal is whether someone has ever given up a prepaid wireless phone number. Where housing is often uncertain, those numbers are a more reliable way to find you than addresses; giving one up may indicate you are willing (or have been forced) to disappear from family or potential employers. That is a bad sign. Zest recently branched into “near prime” borrowers, who have either fallen from the prime category or risen from subprime. The question is why these people have changed categories, and Zest tries to figure out if a potentially reliable borrower has had some temporary bad luck, like a one-time medical expense. “‘Character’ is a loaded term, but there is an important difference between ability to pay and willingness to pay,” said Mr. Merrill. “If all you look at is financial transactions, it’s hard to say much about willingness.”Archived snippets are here, and MP3 versions are hereApple's India test: how to gain volume and meet aspiration: For years, India has been a low priority for Apple as spending power is weaker than in China, where the company's iPhones swiftly became must-have devices after their 2007 launch. But Apple is now looking to build on a 93 percent increase in its iPhone sales in India in April-June, which for the first time outpaced growth in China, of 87 percent - albeit from a low base. Apple has just a 2 percent share of India's smartphone market, while South Korean rival Samsung Electronics accounts for around one third of volume sales with its range of Android phones. \"Apple is consciously expanding its distribution in India and pushing its products aggressively. The marketing spend too is a part of that,\" said Jaideep Mehta, managing director for India and South Asia at tech research firm IDC. Executives at several electronics retail chains and Apple distributors said the Cupertino-based firm was chasing shelf space to make its gadgets more visible, and has more than doubled the number of distributors to five. Apple has also brought in a new senior executive to take charge solely of the Indian market, industry sources said, and has placed advertisements for a policy adviser to help it work with New Delhi's bureaucracy. \"Apple's single-minded focus for India is on volume,\" said a senior executive at an electronics chain store, who declined to be named. \"They have increased distributors and want to reach out to smaller cities.\" Taking to Indian TV screens for the first time, Apple plays up the aspirational appeal of its phones, showing a glamorous Indian bride using Facetime, Apple's video calling feature, to send coy flashes to her groom of a henna-ed hand or skirt hem before their wedding. In addition, Apple offers financing schemes where buyers of its latest iPhone 6 can pay in monthly instalments, and has launched Apple Music, a cloud-based music streaming service, for just 120 rupees ($1.88) a month in India - a fifth of the price in the United States. \"The premium smartphone market will be close to 8 million units in 2015,\" said Neil Shah, analyst at Counterpoint. \"Apple has a lot of room to grow and capture a significant share of that,\" he added, noting Apple sold just over a million iPhones in India in the year to April.Flipboard has confirmed that it has raised $50 million. Flipboard didn’t provide valuation for the round, though JP Morgan is participating, and the funding will be used to build out the product and team, the company said. According to the regulatory documents, the valuation of the most-recent round could range from $800 million to $1.32 billion. The raise comes at a time when rumors cropped up that Twitter might buy Flipboard — though, to be sure, it’s not exactly clear how far those talks progressed — and had held discussions with a few other companies like Google and Yahoo. The company said its user base had jumped 75% in the past six months or so to 72 million monthly active users, with the vast majority of that coming from mobile devices. The company said it sees anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 activations every day around the world. Still, the company will face stiff competition from new entries like Apple News — and will have to grapple whether the company can continue to grow in the face of that competition.Archived snippets are here, and MP3 versions are hereIntel Issues $7 Billion in Bonds to Help Fund Takeover of Altera: Intel tapped the bond market for $7 billion to finance part of its $16.7 billion takeover of Altera Corp. at lower rates than initially offered to investors. The world’s biggest chipmaker sold the longest portion of the four-part deal, $2 billion of 30-year, 4.9 percent securities, to yield 1.85 percentage points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread tightened as the day went on, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Similar-maturity debt was traded at a 1.8 percentage point spread in the secondary market on Tuesday, Bloomberg data show. Intel may have offered generous terms to appease investors dealing with a turbulent market, CreditSights analysts led by Erin Lyons wrote in a research note Wednesday, as a disappointing earnings forecast from Apple sent technology stocks tumbling.

Talks with some private equity and strategic investors have begun, and the deal size would likely be around $300 million and help Tata Communications reduce debt on its books. According to Tata Communications’ 2014 annual report, the data centre subsidiary is profitable, and returned a net profit of Rs. 23 crore for 2013-14 on a revenue of Rs. 375 crore. The company is yet to announce its numbers for 2014-15. “In the long run, unless the company is able to raise equity funding, its ability to raise additional debt funding may be restricted. This, in turn, could adversely affect the capital expenditure programme in the long run,” the annual report said. Tata Communications Data Centre has facilities in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata and Pune and some tier-II, and tier-III towns. The company also provides data centre services in the US, the UK and Singapore. It owns over 1 million sq. ft of data centre and co-location space across 44 global locations and also has eight partner sites in Australia, Malaysia, Germany and the Netherlands, according to the company’s website. In 2013-14, the Tata Communications had a 28% market share of the Indian data market and a 25% market share of the Indian data centre market, according to the company’s annual report. Several global and Indian firms are in the process of setting up data centres in India.Archived snippets are here, and MP3 versions are hereHere is an MP3 version of this snippetJD.com launches online store to sell U.S. brands in China: JD.com Inc, the no. 2 Chinese e-commerce company, said it would start selling U.S. products to customers in China through a new store on its website, as it looks to battle competition from bigger rival Alibaba. Both companies have recently started exclusive stores that offer products from countries including Japan, France, South Korea and Australia. JD.com also said on Monday that it would be the first authorized seller of Taylor Swift merchandise in China, which will include a line of clothes designed by the singer exclusively for JD.com customers. JD.com said the \"U.S. Mall\" would feature American brands such as Converse, Samsonite, and major apparel labels that are part of the Global Brands Group, including Nautica Kids and Jeep apparel. JD.com's U.S.-listed shares were little changed at $35.39 on the Nasdaq. Up to Friday's close, the stock had gained about 53 percent this year.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetTesla Offers New ‘Ludicrous Mode’: Zero to 60 in 2.8 Seconds: Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk introduced a new “Ludicrous Mode” for the dual-motor version of the Model S during a call on Friday, allowing the all-electric sedan to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 2.8 seconds. The upgrade costs an additional $10,000 for new buyers and results in a 10 percent acceleration improvement. The hold music before the conference call began was a loop of the rap song Beast Mode by Ludacris. Tesla will also offer Ludicrous Mode for its coming Model X SUV, which will probably clock in at zero to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds, according to Musk. “We haven’t tested it yet, so that’s just a guess,” he said. “That’s mad for an SUV, obviously.” Here’s how Tesla squeezed out the extra juice to go from insane to ludicrous. The limiting factor for acceleration during the first 30 mph is traction—basically getting the wheels to stay connected to earth. Tesla had already solved that engineering roadblock. The limiting factor when accelerating from 30 mph to 60 mph, on the other hand, is pulling enough current from the battery pack.Etsy Surges Most Since IPO on Mention in Google Revenue Call: Etsy surged the most since it went public, after Google said the online artisan marketplace is seeing a boost in traffic from mobile-search results. Etsy gained 31 percent to $21.98 at the close in New York, the biggest climb since its IPO on April 16. The shares had increased 5.2 percent from the stock’s debut through Thursday’s close. Brooklyn-based Etsy, a platform where sellers offer homemade and vintage items ranging from jewelry to wall art, has been trying to boost sales after its first-quarter net loss widened. Google’s “deep links,” which redirect users to mobile applications when they click results from a Web search, could help Etsy lure more shoppers to its marketplace.“Developers like Etsy are already seeing a boost in traffic as a result of deep linking,” Omid Kordestani, Google’s chief business officer, said on an earnings phone call Thursday. Etsy’s sudden spike may be creating what’s called a short squeeze -- meaning traders who were betting against the company have to cover their positions at the higher price, leading to swings in the stock.China central bank issues guidelines on internet finance development: The central bank called on the government to support internet firms in setting up platforms for expenditures and loans, crowdfunding, the sale of financial products and other financing platforms. It called for broadening channels of financing and supporting private investment funds to back the internet finance industry. The bank also recommended tax breaks for qualifying small enterprises including start-ups, saying that provincial level governments should increase their support for those companies.Indian PC market dips as smartphone, tablet sales rise: PC market in the country has declined for the first time to 10.6 million units, falling over 10 per cent, on account of growing consumer preference for smartphones and tablets, industry body MAIT today said. According to MAIT-IMRB report, desktop and notebook market cumulatively stood at 11.8 million units in 2013-14. Smartphone market in 2014-15 grew 33 per cent to 69.6 million units, while phablets and tablets grew 527 per cent (50.8 million) and four per cent (3.4 million units) respectively. In revenue terms, the PC market declined to Rs 21,058 crore in 2014-15 from Rs 25,117 crore in the previous fiscal. For smartphones and tablets, the revenue was up 88 per cent to over Rs 65,815 crore in 2014-15 from Rs 34,900 crore a year ago. “The growth is expected to continue in 2015-16 with smartphones expected to grow 27 per cent, phablets 65 per cent and tablets 16 per cent,” he said. During the year 2014-15, server sales registered a growth of 30 per cent over the last financial year at 1,82,727 units. The overall size of Indian ICT hardware market, which comprises printers, servers and computers among others, stood at USD 15.87 billion, showing a growth of 23.98 per cent over the previous year.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetHere is an MP3 version of this snippetHere is an MP3 version of this snippetFoxconn Starts Manufacturing Smartphones in India Amid Modi Push: Foxconn Technology Group started making its first smartphones in India as part of the Taiwanese company’s plan to expand in the South Asian nation. Production has started in Andhra Pradesh state in the nation’s south east, Foxconn spokesman Louis Woo said, declining to comment further. Models for clients Xiaomi Corp. and InFocus Inc. have started shipping from a facility in Sri City according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because it’s not been officially announced. Foxconn is looking to expand in India amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s drive to boost manufacturing in Asia’s third-largest economy. Billionaire chairman Terry Gou, whose business empire gets half its revenue from Apple expects to open as many as 12 factories and create one million jobs in India by 2020, Foxconn said in a statement citing Gou. FIH Mobile, Foxconn’s phone manufacturing unit, expects to have multiple manufacturing sites in India, with none employing more than 10,000 people, the company said in May.Uber having trouble raising China fund, expects to lose $3B over next 3 years, says report in rival-backed tech site: On Tuesday, a report emerged on Chinese tech news site Sina Tech citing a “source close to Uber” as saying that the company has had trouble finding first-tier Chinese investors. Uber has reportedly asked Goldman Sachs for help with finding Chinese investors (a technique it has used before) but the company has thusfar been met with mostly rejections from top-tier Chinese and Asian investors. According to Sina Tech’s anonymous source, when Uber first started looking for investors, it wasn’t giving out detailed financial information about its China business beyond the somewhat questionable one-million-rides-a-day number it “leaked” earlier this summer. But when investors balked at the lack of information, Uber was forced to cough up more, and those numbers apparently don’t look great. Uber reportedly expects to do US$1.1 billion in total sales in China in 2015, but it also expects to post losses of US$1.1 billion there this year. Over the next three years, Uber apparently expects its China business to lose $3 billion. Any report in the Chinese tech press that cites only anonymous sources is worth taking with a grain of salt, of course. And Sina Tech’s parent company Sina, through its Sina Weibo subsidiary, does own a share in Uber rival Didi Kuaidi, so “black PR” certainly can’t be ruled out. But it does seem odd that Uber still hasn’t announced its funding round despite having reportedly nabbed one of Didi Kuaidi’s top investors weeks ago.Google Takes on Apple With Smartphone Location Tracking Tools: Google is stepping up efforts against Apple’s location technology with new tools to link smartphones to nearby objects. The search giant on Tuesday introduced a new format called Eddystone that lets electronic beacons provide more specific locations and other information within applications, the company said in a blog post. The tools, which compete with Apple’s iBeacon technology, will enable smartphone users at a museum, for example, to get more information on a painting they’re looking at or to gain easy access to electronic bus tickets when they’re near a bus stop. Apple rolled out iBeacon in 2013. Using a low-energy Bluetooth signal, the software makes an iPhone’s proximity to certain items easier to track with the help of $10 signaling device beacons mounted on shelves and ceilings, each no bigger than a hockey puck. Other providers also have introduced location technology. Google’s Eddystone will be open to other platforms and has features that work on Android and the iPhone, the company said. Also, the company wants to integrate the system in its Google Now service, which gives users contextual information around them before they need to search for it.Product developers are preparing to offer a variety of items to consumers that will allow scent to become a part of digital messaging.: This fall, the start-up Vapor Communications, for example, will introduce several devices to include subtle scents with books, movies and clothing. And the company will start mass production of its oPhone Duo, a tabletop device that can emit scents based on how an iPhone photo is labeled. Another company, Scentee, already has a scent product on the market. The product, also called Scentee, is a cartridge that plugs into a smartphone’s headphone jack. It can be set up with an app to emit a puff of fragrance when a text message or email arrives. Smells tended to linger and become muddled with other smells, but Vapor Communications says it has overcome that problem with a system that includes small plastic pellets with scents that are activated when air flows over them. The scent is not dispersed widely; users have to lean in close, as if sniffing a flower, to smell anything at all. All of the products depend on a small pellet called an oChip — the “o” in the product names is for olfactory. In the oPhone, each chip contains from one to four aromas. The chips are sold in packets of eight, grouped into “families” of similar smells, called Coffee, Foodie and Memory. A person who wants to describe the smell of a pasta sauce, for example, could choose notes of tomato, rosemary and parsley, which would then command the player to position those chips so the air would flow over them, combining the scents.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetUber resumes payments through credit card in India: Beginning today, ride sharing app Uber Technologies Inc has resumed accepting credit card payments in India. Uber’s app has been tweaked for the two-factor authentication (2FA) flow that the Reserve Bank of India mandates for all card-based payments, the company said in a press statement. This feature is available to all Android users immediately and will be extended on the iOS platform in the coming weeks. Uber had stopped accepting payments through credit cards (issued in India) and debit cards seven months ago after it was pulled up by the RBI. As a safety measure, RBI requires all credit and debit card transactions to undergo a two-step process for honouring payments. Typically, a user swipes or enters the credit/debit card information in the first step and then has to enter a password in the second step. Uber followed only one-step authentication and directly billed users at the end of the ride, which fell foul of RBI rules. The San Francisco-based company had tied up with mobile wallet firm Paytm to sidestep the 2FA compliance requirement. Uber will continue to accept Paytm payments, it said.Netflix Hits A New All-Time High Ahead Of Its Stock Split And Q2 Earnings: Netflix’s shares popped nearly four percent today to an all-time high of $707.61. The new record comes a day before the company splits its shares on a seven-for-one basis, and two days before it will report earnings. Shares in the online video streaming and content shop have been on a tear, roughly doubling so far this year. Netflix is now worth north of $40 billion. Driving the bull run in Netflix has been its share split, which has proved quite popular with investors, and recent strong analyst sentiment on the company. New price targets can sometimes move prices closer to targets, of course. At risk for Netflix is the heavy weight of high expectations. On the heels of its split, if Netflix borks its earnings, investors will be merciless. Also in the cards for Netflix is simply how richly it is valued. The company has, according to Yahoo Finance, a forward price-earnings ratio of more than 200. That implies that investors are quite willing to pay for tomorrow’s profits today when it comes to Big Red.Ellen Pao resigns as Reddit chief executive: Ellen Pao has resigned as interim chief executive of Reddit, the popular online message board, following widespread user criticism of the way she was running the company. Reddit announced the change Friday afternoon in a company post, saying that the resignation was \"by mutual agreement.\" Pao will be replaced by Steve Huffman, Reddit's co-founder and original chief executive. Pao, who had been at the company only eight months, came under withering criticism for firing a popular employee, Victoria Taylor, the company’s director of talent. Taylor was beloved among Reddit's powerful moderators, who don't work for the company but have complete editorial control over the thousands of niche discussion sections on virtually every topic, including cute animals and depression. Reddit's message boards draw about 160 million active users. Taylor was also a rare, public female face at Reddit and in tech world. Amid the vitriol directed at Pao, many users pointed out the irony that Pao would have let go a prominent woman at Reddit right after losing a bruising, high-profile gender discrimination suit earlier this year. After Taylor's dismissal, moderators revolted, shutting public access to hundreds of discussion boards over several days. Users also circulated an online petition, that has gathered more than 200,000 signatures, calling for Pao to step down. Pao posted an apology this week for the way the Taylor firing was handled. On Friday, she released a statement on Reddit saying that she resigned because \"the board asked me to demonstrate higher user growth in the next six months than I believe I can deliver while maintaining reddit’s core principles.\"Carmakers to tech partners: Keep your hands off our data: Carmakers are limiting the data they share with technology partners Apple and Google through new systems that link smartphones to vehicle infotainment systems, defending access to information about what drivers do in their cars. Auto companies hope that the vehicle data will one day generate billions of dollars in e-commerce, though they are just beginning to form strategies for monetizing the information. Apple and Google already make money from smartphone owners by providing a variety of products and services, from digital music to targeted advertising, and connecting phones to car systems will almost certainly extend their reach. But as infotainment systems such as Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto become more widespread, auto companies hope to keep tech providers from gaining access to a wealth of potentially profitable information collected by computer systems in cars. Some auto companies have specifically said they will not provide Apple and Google with data from the vehicle's functional systems - steering, brakes and throttle, for instance - as well as information about range, a measure of how far the car can travel before it runs out of gas. Auto companies hope to profit from in-vehicle data in a variety of ways, including the provision of travel planning services and auto repair and service information they hope will bring drivers to dealerships. They also expect to work with insurance companies, providing information that would allow insurers to base their rates on a driver's behavior behind the wheel.Across Asia, investments in technology start-ups have risen to levels comparable to the United States.: In the first six months of this year, 46 Asian start-ups, including Apus, have had fund-raising rounds of $100 million or more, just short of the 48 in North America, according to the research firm CB Insights. The focus of investors in Asia — China and India in particular — reflects an increasingly decentralized reality in global technology investment. Asian banks, private equity firms, venture capital funds and hardware and Internet giants are all willing to invest in domestic start-ups. And American investors are increasingly willing to back Asian players with advantages in their home markets. China and India have two of the world’s largest smartphone markets, and investors are particularly interested in finding ways to make money from these giants. Small hardware companies that use their knowledge of China’s electronics supply chain to make sensors and novel devices like drones are also drawing attention — realms of technology not yet dominated by the current power players in the industry, namely Apple, Google and Microsoft. In India, the two largest investments were made by the American hedge fund Tiger Global Management and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Alibaba and its finance affiliate Ant Financial invested $575 million in the Indian mobile commerce company One97, while Tiger made a $500 million investment in India’s leading e-commerce site, Flipkart. Tiger Global has yet to make an investment in the United States this year and has focused 82 percent of its new investments in India at companies in their early stages, according to a June report from CB Insights. “India is one of the youngest countries, and their mobile penetration is low,” said Michael Dempsey, an analyst for CB Insights. “With more than a billion people, why wouldn’t it be one of the next major tech hubs? That’s what investors are thinking.”Can SoundCloud Be the Facebook of Music?: SoundCloud has 150 million registered users, up from 10 million in 2011, and claims 175 million total listeners a month. According to ComScore, its traffic across desktop and mobile rose 14 percent in May from a year earlier, and 142 percent from two years ago. The audience skews younger than Spotify’s and Pandora’s. While SoundCloud has become a familiar feature of the digital landscape, it’s barely registered in most coverage of the Grand Streaming Wars of 2015, in which Apple Music, Spotify, Pandora Media, and others scrap for earshare. Then again, 8-year-old SoundCloud has a different mission. Its content is a creator-driven free-for-all: Anybody can upload a song (or other audio) and use SoundCloud’s tools to get it out there. Aspiring musicians, mainstream artists, DJs, podcasters, and others have uploaded 100-million-plus tracks and clips, creating a YouTube-like sprawl of unpredictable content.For listeners, SoundCloud is less like a music collection or radio station than an audio-based social network.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetIBM Discloses Working Version of a Much Higher-Capacity Chip: IBM said on Thursday that it had made working versions of ultradense computer chips, with roughly four times the capacity of today’s most powerful chips. The development lifts a bit of the cloud that has fallen over the semiconductor industry, which has struggled to maintain its legendary pace of doubling transistor density every two years. Intel, which for decades has been the industry leader, has faced technical challenges in recent years. Moreover, technologists have begun to question whether the longstanding pace of chip improvement, known as Moore’s Law, would continue past the current 14-nanometer generation of chips. Each generation of chip technology is defined by the minimum size of fundamental components that switch current at nanosecond intervals. Today the industry is making the commercial transition from what the industry generally describes as 14-nanometer manufacturing to 10-nanometer manufacturing. Each generation brings roughly a 50 percent reduction in the area required by a given amount of circuitry. IBM’s new chips, though still in a research phase, suggest that semiconductor technology will continue to shrink at least through 2018. The semiconductor industry must now decide if IBM’s bet on silicon-germanium is the best way forward. It must also grapple with the shift to using extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, light to etch patterns on chips at a resolution that approaches the diameter of individual atoms. In the past, Intel said it could see its way toward seven-nanometer manufacturing. But it has not said when that generation of chip making might arrive. IBM also declined to speculate on when it might begin commercial manufacturing of this technology generation. This year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company said that it planned to begin pilot product of seven-nanometer chips in 2017. Unlike IBM, however, it has not demonstrated working chips to meet that goal.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetMeanwhile, Apple plans record initial production of new iPhones : Apple is preparing for the largest initial production run for its next iPhones by the end of the year, the Wall Street journal reported. The company is asking suppliers to manufacture 85 million to 90 million units of two new models with 4.7-inch and 5-inch displays. The company had ordered 70 million to 80 million of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus last year, in its largest initial production run so far. The new phones are also expected to feature Force Touch technology which can distinguish between a light tap and deep press, people familiar with the matter told the Journal. The screen sizes are the same as in the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Apple is also expected to maintain the screen resolution.Didi Kuaidi, the Chinese Ride-Hailing Service, Raises $2 Billion: As companies listed in China continue to suffer fallout from the stock market collapse, the Chinese ride-sharing app Didi Kuaidi on Wednesday showed why it is good to be private. The company, whose smartphone services connect users to taxis and private drivers, said in a statement that it had raised $2 billion in a new round of fund-raising, and might raise still more. Didi Kuaidi set out to raise $1.5 billion on June 22, according to its president, Jean Liu. Within five days, the goal had been met, and now the company has closed on at least $2 billion. ‘‘All of our investors are super-long-term investors, and they won’t get affected by short-term hiccup’’ in the stock market, Ms. Liu said. ‘‘They see another Alibaba coming.’’ Didi Kuaidi was born in competition as the amalgam of two companies, Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, that spent heavily and competed ruthlessly for market share in 2013 and 2014 before joining forces. After the fund-raising round, Didi Kuaidi has cash reserves of $3.5 billion, which it said it would spend on building new services, financing research in data analytics and improving customer experiences.Capital One’s String of Mobile Acquisitions Turns Into a Monsoon: It was somewhat surprising last year when Web design firm Adaptive Path was acquired by banking company Capital One. But the bank hasn’t stopped there. On Wednesday it is announcing it has also scooped up Monsoon, a 40-person mobile development shop based in Oakland, California. Capital One won’t say how much it is paying for Monsoon, but said it is in line with other acquisitions of similarly sized firms. As for why it is buying Monsoon, Managing Vice President Skip Potter said the company has a lot of ideas on how to revolutionize banking with mobile apps but needs more workers than it could simply hire on its own. Capital One, best known for its credit card business, has been trying to attract a new generation of banking customers who prefer powerful apps over physical branches. It has opened a handful of cafes in big cities such as San Francisco, but even there the focus is on helping customers get familiar with the brand as opposed to handling individual transactions.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetChina stocks are 8% down this morning; Alibaba stock is at its lifetime low: China's securities regulator said there was \"panic sentiment\" in mainland stock markets on Wednesday, acknowledging the recent increase in irrational selling, Reuters reported. Shortly after, the People's Bank of China said it will closely watch stock market direction and guard against systematic regional financial risks. The comments did little to soothe investor worries about tumbling mainland equities, with the Shanghai Composite sinking more than 8 percent in early trade on Wednesday. In US trading, Alibaba was traded at its lifetime low.Alibaba boosts Singapore Post stake, invest in SingPost's e-commerce unit: Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is investing about $206 million to expand its holdings in Singapore Post and its e-commerce subsidiary, the two companies said in a statement. SingPost is seeking to boost its e-commerce business to offset weak postal revenues, and last year an Alibaba unit bought an over 10 percent stake in SingPost for $249 million. In the latest deal, Alibaba said it was buying an additional 5 percent stake in SingPost for S$187.1 million. Alibaba will also invest up to S$92 million to buy a 34 percent stake in Quantium Solutions, a SingPost subsidiary that provides e-commerce logistics across the Asia Pacific. Alibaba is currently the second largest shareholder in SingPost after Singapore TelecommunicationsMusic streaming firm Saavn raises $100M from Tiger Global, others: Saavn (South Asian Audio Video Network), a US-based Indian music streaming firm, has raised $100 million in Series C funding from existing investor Tiger Global Management and others. The company will use the money to improve product development efforts and to speed up customer acquisition. Saavn is said to be preparing for the launch of a video streaming service. The company claims to be adding one million users every month. Earlier this year, Saavn had appointed former Google executive Mahesh Narayanan as COO. Last year, Saavn added Twitter-powered radio station to its service. It also entered into licensing agreements with Warner Music and EMI Music that helped it add 800,000 tracks from international artists.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetAs Google and Uber Circle Each Other, Google to Test Carpooling Service in Israel: Google said on Monday that it would start testing a carpooling service in Tel Aviv through Waze, the Israeli social mapping start-up that the company bought in 2013 for $1 billion. Unlike similar services offered by the likes of Uber, Google’s carpooling service will allow drivers to recoup only the cost of gas and wear and tear to their vehicles. Drivers will not be able to use the app to offer traditional taxi services. The service, which is currently available only in Israel, is part of Google’s increasing moves into the territory of Uber, the ride-booking service in which the search giant has invested millions of dollars through Google Ventures, its venture capital unit. Over the last year, tensions between the two companies have mounted as both jockey to offer people new services like self-driving cars and on-demand delivery of goods like groceries. Uber, which is valued at roughly $50 billion, has announced plans to develop autonomous cars, and has a team of engineers working on digital mapping technology. The company also has made a tentative offer for Nokia’s digital mapping unit. Uber has started its own carpooling service in the United States, which allows users to divide the cost of a ride when traveling in the same direction.Mood-changing wearable tech sets pulses racing: Doppel is a new breed of wearable device, one that its developers say can actually change the wearer's mood by delivering a tactile beat to their wrist. The makers of 'doppel' call it the next generation of wearable technology - one that can actually change the mood of the user. They say the device taps in to the body's natural rhythm and gives the wearer control over how alert or relaxed they are. Similar to the way that upbeat music can motivate the body, while downbeat music relaxes; doppel provides a tactile beat to the wearer's wrist that they can adjust to make themselves feel more alert or relaxed. Doppel is synchronized to each individual via a smartphone app that measures their resting heart rate. This is all the information needed for the device to tap into the body's natural response to external rhythms. Team Turquoise says prototype models have been successfully tested on hundreds of people. They say doppel was also independently tested by psychologists at Royal Holloway University of London; with their controlled tests showing the device can improve alertness when correctly set to the user's preference. The team is planning further independent tests aimed at validating doppel's ability to calm people down and reduce anxiety. They recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to turn their prototypes in to consumer-ready models, with backers to be the first to get their hands on their own doppel.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetEuro markets set for major jolt after Greek 'No', look to ECB for calm: European stock and bond markets are set to take a sharp hit on Monday after Greece voted 'No' to harsh bailout conditions, and bankers said the European Central Bank's response was now key to the extent of contagion. \"The ECB has the capacity to limit the spread of contagion. But we might still see a fall of 3 percent on European markets on Monday,\" said Antonin Jullier, head of equity trading strategy at Citi. With no immediate prospect of a bailout for the Greek government, its banks need further help to avoid collapsing. Oil prices tumbled as the US dollar strengthened. European officials are putting the onus on the Greek government to make the next move as Chancellor Angela Merkel heads to Paris on Monday for talks with President Francois Hollande to map out a way forward for Greece.After weeks of turmoil, China stocks rocket 8 percent at open after weekend rescue moves: China's stock markets rose 8% at the start of a make-or-break week after officials rolled out an unprecedented series of steps at the weekend to prevent a full-blown stock market crash that would threaten the world's second-largest economy. The government is anxiously awaiting the market opening on Monday to see if the new measures will halt a 30 percent plunge in the last three weeks, or if panicky investors who borrowed heavily to speculate on stocks will continue to sell. In an extraordinary weekend of policy moves, brokerages and fund managers vowed to buy massive amounts of stocks, helped by China's state-backed margin finance company which in turn would be aided by a direct line of liquidity from the central bank. China has also orchestrated a halt to new share issues, with dozens of firms scrapping their IPO plans in separate but similarly worded statements over the weekend, in a tactic authorities have used before to support markets. The Shanghai Composite Index had surged more than 150 percent in the 12 months prior to June 12 as investors assessed that monetary stimulus would revive China’s economy. Now, those hopes seem to be fading, and Chinese equity markets are plunging. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 5.8 percent Friday, bringing the decline since its June 12 peak to 29 percent. More than $2.8 trillion of value has been erased from the Chinese stock market during that time, an abrupt end to the longest bull market in the nation’s history. Stocks entered a bear market on June 29 as leveraged investors headed for the exits; China’s securities regulator that day urged investors to be rational. In response, China is suspending initial public offerings, creating a market stabilization fund and telling investors not to panic in an effort to shore up its stock market, which has had the largest three-week drop since 1992. According to company filings to the exchanges Saturday evening, 10 companies will suspend IPOs on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and 18 will do the same at the Shenzen Stock Exchange. Halting IPOs may stem the diversion of funds away from current listings. The move came hours after major Chinese brokerage firms pledged billions of dollars to form a stock market rescue fund.Alibaba Arm Eyes More Capital to Build China Finance Empire: Ant Financial, which dominates e-commerce payments in China, was said to be valued at over $40 billion in its latest round -- making it one of the world’s largest private tech companies. It manages the nation’s biggest money market fund Yu’E Bao and is targeting smaller borrowers to tap a market overlooked by traditional banks. Investors may be drawn by Ant Financial’s exponential growth. Since it began life as Alipay in 2004, the company has become the country’s largest online provider of financial services, helped by its role as the preferred payment method across Alibaba platforms. It has since expanded into adjacent industries such as insurance and online credit. One of the more aggressive of China’s new breed of online finance companies, Ant Financial’s maneuvers have courted controversy in the past. Ma spun off Alipay into a new company he controlled in 2011, citing the risk of foreign ownership of domestic financial firms. Major shareholder Yahoo protested and said it was caught unaware.Housing crisis puts SoftBank in a spot amidst its headline grabbing announcements: The fall of Housing.com from one of the hottest tech startups in India to a big public relations disaster has been quick, thanks to its just ousted CEO Rahul Yadav. And this has put the largest owner of Housing—Japanese internet giant SoftBank, one of the biggest internet investors from Asia with $70B in revenue—in a delicate spot. Only six months ago it wrote a $90 million cheque for this college startup in exchange of a 32.5 per cent stake, but it appears SoftBank is already exploring a sale. Sources familiar with developments at the online real estate company said Quikr-Housing.com deal, as reported by VCCircle, is in works but it may not be easy to fructify due to several reasons including a mismatch in valuation expectations. SoftBank, Housing’s biggest stakeholder, is said to be seeking a price of $350 million which none of its rivals would want to cough up considering the startup’s main asset is its product and technology and not so much the business (revenues). As an immediate sale may prove to be daunting, sources say SoftBank’s current priority would be to stabilise the affairs at the startup while also increase the monetisation efforts rather than stepping up the sell-off initiatives. “They wanted to make a big bang entry into India with a $1 billion investment, make a splash, and get a meeting with (Prime Minister) Modi..,” said a venture capital investor who manages a diverse portfolio, indicating the Japanese giant might have made a mistake in a hurry to invest.Reddit Moderators Revolt Over Site's Firing of Popular Talent Director Victoria Taylor: Hundreds of Reddit's community forums—called subreddits—have been made inaccessible to the public in protest after the San Francisco-based company dismissed its director of talent, Victoria Taylor, who ran its Ask Me Anything (AMA) feature. The extremely popular AMA subreddit has been temporarily shut down by its moderators, while the reasons for Taylor's exit haven't been revealed. According to Business Insider, Reddit user \"Karmanaut\" posted about Taylor's departure, stating: \"We have been really blindsided by all of this. As a result, we will need to go through our processes and see what can be done without her.\" The Business Insider story added that Taylor replied in a subbredit thread that she was \"dazed\" by the development but planned to stay in the public relations/communications field. For the AMA program, she has been credited for booking everyone from Hollywood stars like Madonna and Will Ferrell to political players such as President Barack Obama and conservative commentator Ann Coulter. Taylor was widely beloved by Redditors for cultivating such an intriguing mix of content. Reddit may be wise to shed more light on Taylor's departure sooner rather than later, otherwise the subject could continue to explode throughout the July 4 weekend. Already, many users are threatening to leave Reddit for good in an exodus similar to the user backlash that gutted competing site Digg in 2010.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetYelp Sale Process to Stall as Founder Decides to Wait; Stock Slumps: Yelp, which hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to find a buyer, has temporarily decided not to pursue a sale. The consumer-review website has had several interested suitors but isn’t pursuing a transaction in the immediate future. The firm may pursue a deal again if co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Stoppelman changes his mind, one of the people said. Yelp dropped 12 percent in afternoon trading in New York, giving the company a market value of about $2.8 billion. Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported in May that Yelp was working with a bank to explore a sale. Yelp hired Goldman Sachs after receiving takeover interest.Xiaomi reports sequential sales fall, putting full-year goal in doubt: China's top smartphone maker Xiaomi on Thursday reported semi-annual sales that for the first time were lower than the previous six months, jeopardising its full-year target and hinting at a slowdown in its mainstay domestic market. The firm said it sold 34.7 million handsets in January-June versus 35.0 million in July-December - the first sequential fall since the company began disclosing six-month figures in 2013. For 2015, it aims for minimum sales of 80 million smartphones. Smartphone shipments in China - where Xiaomi is No. 1 - fell in the first quarter for the first time in six years, though it was unclear whether the drop signalled the start of a downward trend, researcher IDC said in May. Beijing-based Xiaomi has been expanding overseas to relieve the pressure at home, focusing on India, Southeast Asia and, from next week, Brazil.Venture Investment In Healthcare Declines Through Q2 After Record 2014: After a record-breaking year of growth in 2014, venture capital investors in healthcare seem to have settled into a groove. They invested roughly $2.8 billion in healthcare technologies through the second quarter of 2015, down from $3.3 billion over the same period last year, according to a study from Startup Health. Nearly $6.8 billion went into healthcare technologies that year, up from $3 billion the year before. Driven by twin engines of government legislation and technology innovation around wearable devices and data, venture capital investments in healthcare went up like a rocket in 2014. Now, the industry seems to be catching its breath a bit. Investments in healthcare technology actually held steady in the second quarter at $1.8 billion after a $500 million decline year-on-year in the first quarter. An examination of some of the companies that have raised the most money and successfully exited: Zenefits and Oscar Health , which are tackling the regulatory changes brought on by the Affordable Care Act, raised more than respectable $500 million and $145 million rounds, respectively. While Nant Health, a company using big data analytics for genomic sequencing, and HealthCatalyst, which uses data to track health across populations, both scored big with their own big rounds of $200 million and $70 million. On the wearables side, the FitBit public offering proved that even public markets were interested in the wearable health opportunity.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetAs More Tech Start-Ups Stay Private, So Does the Money: Something strange has happened in the last couple of years: The initial public offering of stock has become déclassé. For start-up entrepreneurs and their employees across Silicon Valley, an initial public offering is no longer a main goal. Instead, many founders talk about going public as a necessary evil to be postponed as long as possible because it comes with more problems than benefits. Silicon Valley’s sudden distaste for the IPO. — rooted in part in Wall Street’s skepticism of new tech stocks — may be the single most important psychological shift underlying the current tech boom. Staying private affords start-up executives the luxury of not worrying what outsiders think and helps them avoid the quarterly earnings treadmill. It also means Wall Street is doing what it failed to do in the last tech boom: using traditional metrics like growth and profitability to price companies. Investors have been tough on Twitter, for example, because its user growth has slowed. They have been tough on Box, the cloud-storage company that went public last year, because it remains unprofitable. And the e-commerce company Zulily, which went public last year, was likewise punished when it cut its guidance for future sales. During a recent presentation for Andreessen Horowitz’s limited partners — the institutions that give money to the venture firm — Marc Andreessen, the firm’s co-founder, told the journalist Dan Primack that he had never seen a sharper divergence in how investors treat public- and private-company chief executives. “They tell the public C.E.O., ‘Give us the money back this quarter,’ and they tell the private C.E.O., ‘No problem, go for 10 years,’ ” Mr. Andreessen said.PayPal to Acquire Xoom for $890 Million Ahead of EBay Split: PayPal agreed to purchase Xoom Corp, a service for sending international money transfers, in a deal valued at $890 million. PayPal will acquire Xoom for $25 per share in cash, a 21 percent premium to Wednesday’s closing price. The purchase is expected to slightly reduce PayPal’s earnings per share for fiscal 2016, the company said. The acquisition puts PayPal in the international money transfer market with Western Union, the dominant player in what PayPal President Dan Schulman estimated is a $600 billion market. “It’s an industry that’s ripe for disruption,” Schulman, who will become chief executive officer of the stand-alone PayPal, said in an interview. Xoom, based in San Francisco, enables U.S. customers to send as much as $3,000 in a single transaction to friends and family around the world using their mobile phones, tablets or computers. Its 1.3 million users transferred $7 billion to 37 countries, including Mexico, China and India, in the 12 months ended March 31, the company said. Xoom’s first-quarter revenue gained 24 percent to $44.4 million.India Now Uber’s Second Largest Market - By City Coverage - Following Expansion To 7 New Cities: Uber is continuing its focus on Asia after announcing that it will expand into seven new cities in India, taking it to a total of 18 locations in the country. With 18 cities served, India becomes the company’s biggest market based on city coverage, behind only the U.S..The U.S. firm recently claimed one million rides per day in China following rapid growth, and it is also sweet on India. It has hired a president to run its business in India and has seemingly invested significant sums to grow its visibility and presence in India, now it’s time to crank its plans up a gear. Uber said that this expansion — which will see it drive into Bhubaneswar, Coimbatore, Indore, Mysore, Nagpur, Surat and Visakhapatnam — is the “largest number of new international cities [it] has ever launched together.” A leaked letter to investors recently suggested that China will overtake the U.S. as Uber’s largest market based on rides handle per day. While the company isn’t spilling raw figures for its business in India, it did say that it is seeing “unprecedented” 40 percent month-on-month growth across the country.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetXiaomi Continues International Push, Starts Selling $160 Redmi 2 Phone in Brazil: Xiaomi made its expected move into the Brazil market on Tuesday, announcing plans to sell its affordable Redmi 2 smartphone for 499 Brazilian reals ($161). To avoid hefty taxes placed on foreign imports, Xiaomi is working with Foxconn to have the devices built in Brazil, with additional products coming soon.Online recharge and mobile wallet app MobiKwik targets $700M GTV in 2015-16, profits by 2016-17: MobiKwik.com, is gunning for a nearly four-fold jump in gross transaction value to $700 million (Rs 4,270 crore) this year. “We don’t have the audited numbers right now, but I can tell you that we have crossed the 2014-15 target of Rs 1200 crore ($190 million) sales and are looking forward to $700 million sales this year,” Upasana Taku, co-founder of the company told Techcircle. The Gurgaon-based company aims to turn profitable by financial year 2016-17. “We expect to meet our goal of 100 million users for the mobile wallet by 2016-17 and so next year we anticipate to start generating profits,” she added. Profitability is the holy grail for India’s fast growing consumer internet firms. MobiKwik’s competitor, the Alibaba-backed Paytm saw the gross value of the transactions conducted on its network rise to around Rs 4,000 crore by 2014-end from around Rs 1,000 crore the year before. Paytm is said to be targeting gross merchandise value (GMV) run rate of $3-4 billion by March 2015. MobiKwik plans to spend about Rs 100 crore on marketing this financial year. Most of the money will be deployed on television and online campaigns. MobiKwik is also betting big on joining hands with offline service provider. It started a service for offline players in March 2015 and has the likes of quick service restaurants, grocery stores and coffee stores on its platform. It has tie ups with Big Bazaar, Cafe Coffee Day and other players for the same.Apple Music First Look: Rich, Robust — But Confusing: Paid streaming music has arrived on Planet Apple, where it was regarded as unworthy for years. Today, the tech giant has entered the streaming music business with its much-anticipated Apple Music subscription service. Like other streaming services, it offers access to tens of millions of tracks for a monthly fee. Would I pay $10 a month — $120 a year — to use it? My answer is a tentative yes, with some caveats. Apple has built a handsome, robust app and service that goes well beyond just offering a huge catalog of music by providing many ways to discover and group music for a very wide range of tastes and moods. But it’s also uncharacteristically complicated by Apple standards, with everything from a global terrestrial radio station to numerous suggested playlists for different purposes in different places. One of the most confusing aspects of Apple Music is that it moves all your iTunes Music to the cloud, along with the streaming catalog. On the other hand, the service has three big strengths, in my view. First, it smoothly integrates the existing library of iTunes songs you own with the much larger catalog of music you are merely, in effect, renting. Second, while the service does use some algorithms, it suggests numerous playlists, albums and songs curated by 300 human editors, based on your tastes. Third, while Apple’s $10 monthly fee per user is both standard — and for some, pricey — the company is offering a family plan that cuts the price dramatically.LTE-U versus WiFi: The future of mobile data pits cellphone carriers against cable giants: To cellular providers, WiFi represents a huge missed opportunity. Internet consumption on cellular data networks — your 3G or 4G connection - could've grown by a whopping 84 percent last year, according to Cisco. But because consumers shunted so much traffic to WiFi, that figure was much lower, at 69 percent. Carriers could charge you for all that extra access to the mobile data network. Instead they're losing out when you hop onto WiFi at your home or office. And LTE-U is the industry's solution. The cable industry, on the other hand, wants to keep you on WiFi as much as possible. This is the math they fear: By 2019, Americans are expected to consume nearly 10 times more mobile data than they did in 2014. By then, 77 percent of all Internet traffic will be sent and received over mobile devices rather than stationary PCs. That's not good for cable, an industry that built its reputation on running fast (but fixed) Internet service into people's homes and businesses. You're probably familiar with 4G LTE, the current cutting edge of mobile data technology. Under ideal conditions, it provides download speeds that rival what you can get on a wired connection — fast enough to download a song in less than a minute. LTE-U is virtually identical to LTE, but with one key difference: It runs on the same frequencies that WiFi does. Unlike regular LTE, which piggybacks on airwaves owned exclusively by your carrier, LTE-U travels on public airwaves that are free to anyone. Garage door openers, cordless phones, WiFi routers — all also transmit over these open channels. Interference between the two technologies can slash WiFi transmission rates by 75 percent, according to a Google white paper filed last month to the federal government. The cable industry's top trade group, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, argued the technology could be \"disastrous\" without further protections and \"will severely degrade consumers' Wi-Fi experience, rendering unusable many services that are widespread today, to say nothing of the innovative new uses currently on the horizon.\"Samsung, HTC suffer blowback from phone financing schemes of years past, as consumers turn slow to upgrade: It’s payback time for handset makers that long profited from Americans’ tendency to upgrade their mobile phones early and often. U.S. consumers got a taste for phone financing two years ago and never looked back. They bought fancy new devices for a few more dollars a month with no service contract attached. Now they’re holding on to their old smartphones longer than they did when they signed two-year contracts and got freebies, spelling further trouble for manufacturers like Samsung Electronics Co. and HTC Corp. that have struggled with declining sales. “When people spend $600 to $700, they are not in the mood to upgrade every year,” said independent wireless analyst Chetan Sharma. Thrifty consumers are starting to buy devices every 20 to 24 months instead of every 15 months when carriers subsidized all of their devices and made up the cost through higher service charges, he said. While iPhone maker Apple Inc. -- whose customers tend to be less price sensitive -- has remained largely unaffected, Samsung and HTC may see the most impact, analysts said. In a sign that the end of subsidies is on the horizon, Dallas-based AT and T asked in May that retail partners like Apple and Best Buy stop offering subsidized phones with two-year contracts and to sell them on its Next financing program instead. Verizon, which has been slower to move to phone financing, expects 50 percent of new sales to be on its Edge installment payment plan this year.Cisco to buy OpenDNS for $635 million to boost security business: Cisco said it would buy OpenDNS, a privately held cloud-based security firm, for $635 million, the latest move to boost its security business as cyber attacks increase in number and sophistication. Cisco has been buying a number of security companies, which has made its relatively tiny security business one of its fastest growing areas in the past two years. OpenDNS uses predictive intelligence to block malware, botnets and phishing threats that antivirus and firewalls miss. Cisco was a minority investor and was one of the backers that invested $35 million in OpenDNS in May last year. When Cisco buys stakes in startups, it often receives defensive rights that give it an edge to acquire companies it has invested in ahead of competitors. Cisco, whose security business is known for its firewalls, expanded into intrusion detection and prevention systems with the $2.7 billion acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013. Cisco, which has acquired dozens of companies over the years, is transitioning towards high-end switches and routers and investing in new products such as data analytics software and cloud-based tools for data centers. It bought malware analysis company ThreatGRID in 2014 and security advisory firm Neohapsis this year.Here is an MP3 version of this snippet.Microsoft Said to Exit Display Ad Business, Cut 1,200 Jobs: Microsoft is shutting down its Web display advertising business and handing operations over to AOL and AppNexus, a person with knowledge of the matter said. About 1,200 jobs at Microsoft will be impacted, with some positions to be moved to AOL and AppNexus. Some people will be offered other positions at Microsoft, while other jobs will be cut, the person said.Uber Bonds Term Sheet Reveals $470 Million in Operating Losses on $415 Million in Revenue: Uber is telling prospective investors that it generates $470 million in operating losses on $415 million in revenue, according to a document provided to prospective investors. The term sheet viewed by Bloomberg News, which is being used to sell $1 billion to $1.2 billion in convertible bonds, doesn’t make clear the time period for those results. The document also touts 300 percent year-over-year growth. Investors in this round will be able to convert the notes at a compounded 11.5 percent discount if the company sells shares on the public market, the document shows. The bonds mature in 2022, with an 8 percent annual return if held through maturity. Uber aims to complete the deal by Tuesday, according to the document. The car-booking startup has been on a spree to raise cash. Uber is negotiating a $2 billion credit line from a group of Wall Street banks, a person with knowledge of the situation said last week. Earlier this year, it raised $1.6 billion in convertible debt from Goldman Sachs wealth-management clients, which valued the company at $40 billion. “These are substantially old numbers that do not reflect business activities today,” Uber spokeswoman Nairi Hourdajian said in an e-mail. Hourdajian declined to say why the numbers are being used to promote a current funding round.Uber to Acquire Mapping Technology and Know-How From Microsoft: Uber will acquire a portion of Microsoft’s maps technology and extend employment offers to around 100 engineers on Microsoft’s mapping team. Uber would not discuss the terms of the acquisition, which will bring it a data site outside Boulder, Colo., as well as cameras, image-analysis software and a license to the intellectual property. Although most Uber services rely on digital maps, much of its interest in mapping is focused on how to improve its carpooling service, UberPool. While Uber relies heavily on mapping technology from Apple, Baidu and especially Google, the company has taken strides to bring as much mapping expertise in-house as possible. Microsoft said the deal on Monday was part of a broader strategy to focus on its core products.The Apple Watch Hasn't Killed Fitbit: Two months after the Apple Watch launch, the leading wrist-based fitness tracking company is doing just fine. The Apple Watch was expected to be a disaster for companies like Fitbit. It hasn’t been. While Fitbit’s sales dipped as anticipation for Apple’s smartwatch grew, the company has bounced back this spring and appears to be doing just fine, according to data provided exclusively to Bloomberg by Slice Intelligence. After Apple’s monster first week, Fitbit products have actually outsold Apple Watches, according to Slice. Slice collects data from the e-mailed receipts of about 2.5 million people. Over the past year, Fitbit has outsold the rest of the fitness tracking market combined (excluding Apple). While the entire industry saw a bump during last year’s holiday season, companies such as Jawbone, Garmin, and Samsung saw their wearable sales decline quickly after Christmas. Fitbit’s never dropped to their pre-holiday levels, and began ramping up again this spring. People are seeking out Fitbit products specifically. When people buy Fitbit products online, the most common place they’re doing it is on the company’s own website. More than 43 percent of Fitbit sales take place on Fitbit.com, slightly edging out Amazon, which accounts for 40 percent of online sales of Fitbit devices. Apple Watch's and Fitbit's consumer bases don’t overlap much. Fitbit is tightly focused on fitness. Apple pitches its product as a more general-use device. There's also a significant difference in price, with Fitbit devices ranging from $60 to $250 and the Apple watch starting at $350 and going straight up to ridiculous. According to Slice, less than 5 percent of people who bought a Fitbit since the end of 2013 have also purchased an Apple Watch. For now, it seems like there’s room in wearable computing for both companies—but maybe not anyone else.Quikr is reportedly in talks to acquire Housing.com: Online classifieds firm Quikr is in talks to acquire real estate portal Housing.com.When contacted, co-founder and CEO of Housing.com Rahul Yadav confirmed the news but only to retract it later. SoftBank had invested in the promising online realty startup close to $90 million in December 2014 valuing the company around $270 million. SoftBank is said to have initiated talks with the potential acquirer Quikr, which has been looking to strengthen its newly launched property sales vertical QuikrHomes by way of inorganic expansion. The sale efforts seem to have been initiated by its investors as they are trying to salvage their investment in the company.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetZestFinance and JD.com announce a joint venture to provide a consumer credit scoring service in China, rivaling Alibaba's offering: The venture, JD-ZestFinance Gaia, will initially be used to assess credit risk and offer installment loans for purchases on JD.com, which has 100 million active customers and generates yearly revenue of $20 billion. The venture intends to eventually offer the credit-analysis service to corporate customers throughout China. JD.com is also making a minority investment in ZestFinance, though the companies would not disclose the size of the investment or the valuation of the start-up. There is a lot of enthusiasm for the data science approach to credit analysis, and venture funding is flowing into this emerging field. The promise is that high-tech tools can give greater depth and detail to the basic principle of banking: know your customer. Start-ups in the field, beside ZestFinance, include Affirm, Earnest, Elevate and LendUp. The start-ups’ methods vary, as do the data sources they tap. But their algorithms sift through data that can include a person’s social-network connections, web-browsing habits, how they fill out online forms and their online purchases. The software looks for patterns and correlations: digital signals that help assess an individual’s willingness and ability to repay. China’s leaders are seeking to stimulate consumer spending to make its economy less dependent on industrial exports. Expanding consumer credit is part of the formula, and the government is allowing private companies, like JD.com, to innovate. JD-ZestFinance Gaia and competitor Sesame Credit, part of Alibaba-affiliated Ant Financial Services Group, hope to use the e-commerce sites' vast swathes of shopping data to turn out a reliable credit risk score.This Driver in China Explains How He Is Helping Rip Off Uber: James Li was unhappy with his pay as a security guard in Shanghai so he started driving on weekends for Uber. He’s almost tripled his pay -- in part by scamming the company. Li, an alias since he feared retribution if his real name was made public, is taking advantage of Uber’s efforts to break into the China market. The U.S. car-booking company is spending millions on free rides and driver bonuses, betting the cash will help train China drivers and market Uber services to customers. Instead, people like Li have figured out how to cash in on Uber’s largesse without giving anyone a ride. He’s part of a cottage industry that has developed so drivers can use modified smartphones and software to place fake bookings and trick Uber into paying out cash for phantom trips. While there are no reliable estimates on how prevalent the scams are, interviews with Uber drivers, equipment vendors and reviews of postings on dedicated online forums suggest at least some of the $1 billion that Uber has pledged to spend to expand the service in China this year is being siphoned off by fake bookings. To create a fake trip, an Uber driver has essentially two options, according to drivers interviewed by Bloomberg. The first is a do-it-yourself option where the driver buys a hacked smartphone that can operate with multiple phone numbers and therefore multiple Uber accounts. Drivers use one number to act as a rider and request a lift, and then accept the trip as a driver with another phone number. The second option involves working with other scammers over the Internet. If a driver doesn’t have a hacked phone, he can go into one of several invitation-only online forums and request a fake fare from professional ride-bookers. These bookers are referred to as “nurses” because they use specially tailored software to put an “injection,” or location-specific ride request near the driver. The driver, or “patient,” then makes the trip while the booker monitors remotely, confirms the journey was made and then pays Uber when the trip is complete. The nurse gets a small fee, usually about $1.60, and the reimbursement for the fare from the patient. The driver in turn collects the fare and a driver bonus that can be three times the fare from Uber, which thinks it is building brand awareness by giving away free rides. The drivers interviewed by Bloomberg spoke of a cat-and-mouse game with Uber and the fear of being caught. A recent software upgrade has made it more difficult to successfully game the system, they said.Intuit Lays Off 399 Employees In Company Realignment: Intuit has confirmed to TechCrunch that it has laid off 399 people, or just under 5 percent of the company’s roughly 8,000 employees, in a re-alignment of the company. Patrick Barry has also stepped back from leading Demandforce, though he remains an employee of Intuit. In the past year, Intuit’s stock has risen more than 28 percent, and the company is currently worth more than $28 billion based on its market cap. Intuit is best known for its tax preparation services like TurboTax and financial services like QuickBooks. In January the company partnered with Uber and Stripe to help those on-demand workers keep track of their finances. The tools help workers quickly figure out what their tax bills and write-offs will be for work-related expenses. In January, Intuit also bought ZeroPaper, a startup that offers online accounting services for small businesses, as it began to take an interest in Brazil. It also bought a payroll services startup Acrede in December this year.The Mouth Is Mightier Than the Pen: New research shows that text-based communications may make individuals sound less intelligent and employable than when the same information is communicated orally. The findings imply that old-fashioned phone conversations or in-person visits may be more effective when trying to impress a prospective employer or, perhaps, close a deal. In the first of a series of experiments presented in the paper, the researchers recruited 18 MBA. candidates from Booth. The students were asked to prepare a brief pitch to a prospective employer — a roughly two-minute proposal that the researchers recorded on video. Separately, the researchers recruited 162 people who were visiting the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago to evaluate these pitches. Some of these museum-goers watched the video, a second group listened to the audio without watching the video, and a third group read a transcript of the pitch. What the researchers found was that the evaluators who heard the pitches — whether in the audio or video version — “rated the candidates intellect more highly” than those who read the transcript, the paper reported. Those who listened or watched also rated the candidates more likable and, critically, more employable. The results are said to validate and expand upon previous research showing that the cadence and intonation of voice allows listeners to do a better job of gauging a person’s thoughts than the same information communicated in writing.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetAlibaba affiliate launches Internet bank for small enterprises: Alibaba's financial affiliate launched on Thursday Internet bank MYbank, targeting the small- and medium-sized Chinese enterprises that have struggled to obtain credit from major financial institutions. MYbank, which is 30-percent owned by Alibaba-linked Ant Financial Services Group, has 4 billion yuan ($644 million) of registered capital and will offer loans of up to 5 million yuan. It will only be able to take in deposits when regulators approve a facial recognition technology that allow its customers to remotely open bank accounts, an Ant Financial spokeswoman told Reuters. MYbank follows in the footsteps of Alibaba arch-rival Tencent Holdings Ltd, which began trial operations of its WeBank, China's first online bank, in January. Credit conditions have remained tight for SMEs, despite a series of policy easing, as banks avoid the companies worst hit by an economic slowdown. State-owned banks have also avoided customers such as farmers and smaller businesses because of the difficulties in assessing their credit worthiness and they have little to offer as collateral.Clashes Erupt Across France as Taxi Drivers Protest Uber: Irate taxi drivers blocked roads, burned tires and attacked drivers who they thought were working for Uber, the ride-hailing company, during a day of protests Thursday that disrupted Paris and slowed traffic to a crawl. Fights broke out on streets, a couple of cars were burned and travelers were frustrated all over Paris and in major cities elsewhere in France, where the labor battle snarled several cities’ streets. “Economic terrorism” is the favored term of Parisian taxi drivers for Uber’s lower prices, flexible hours and the way it is operating outside French law. In France the UberPop service is illegal. It allows anyone who wants to become a driver to sign up without a professional chauffeur license and to pick up fares through the Uber smartphone app. Other Uber services are permitted under strict conditions, and the company is contesting the constitutionality of parts of the law limiting UberPop. The company has instructed its drivers to keep working. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, who met Thursday evening with the taxi unions, deplored the violence, but saved his most angry words for Uber. He said the company behaved with “arrogance” in its flouting of French law and declared that “the government will never accept the law of the jungle,” referring to Uber’s stark form of competition.IBM Pushes Networking and Research to Catch Rivals in the Cloud - Mulls India Data Center: IBM will expand the networking services available through its SoftLayer cloud technology, trying to catch up with deep-pocketed rivals. IBM researchers and engineers are now making regular trips to SoftLayer’s headquarters in Dallas to discuss product plans and get educated about cloud operation, said Marc Jones, SoftLayer’s chief technology officer. Increasing cloud revenue is critical for IBM. It has tried to boost sales for operations like cloud computing and data analytics but that hasn’t been enough to make up for declines in longstanding operations -- such as services and hardware -- and revenue lost from divestitures. The initiative comes almost two years after the Armonk, New York-based company acquired SoftLayer for $2 billion to help IBM compete against Google, Microsoft and Amazon. SoftLayer also plans to open a data center in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and is looking at a location in India.Uber growing 40% month-over-month in India: Uber’s Asia Head: Uber may have had its share of challenges in the Indian market, but the ride sharing app has been growing at over 40 per cent month-over-month here. In fact, Bangalore and Kolkata are some of the fastest growing cities for Uber globally, Eric Alexander, Head of Business, Asia, Uber told Techcircle. The team at Uber India has their work cut out. The regulatory overhang over Uber, which started after a passengers’ sexual assault by an Uber driver in December, continues to play out. It has been facing ban calls in Delhi and other places. Earlier, it came under the RBI scanner over its payment system which automatically debited a user’s credit card after a ride.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetThe Internet of Things Has Vast Economic Potential, McKinsey Report Says: A study by the McKinsey Global Institute predicts that the Internet of things, a term for sensor-laden machines connected to the web, will in the year 2025 create between nearly $4 trillion to $11 trillion in economic benefits globally. That includes profits to device-makers, efficiencies, new businesses and savings to consumers from better-run products. It is difficult to measure the current economic benefit though, because most people now working with the technology are still in the early investment phase. The biggest gains will be made by companies that figure out how to adapt to the new technology, the report said. On an oil-drilling platform, for example, this might mean knowing by the temperature or chemical changes in a pump that something may have happened upstream, away from the pump. In managing city traffic, this could mean learning how to correctly balance information from cars, roads and traffic lights. “This puts a premium on predicting incidents based on data from a multitude of sources,” said Michael Chui, one of the report’s authors. But it will be a challenge for companies to find ways to both organize and take advantage of that information.Dropbox Is Struggling and Competitors Are Catching Up: Dropbox made itself a household name by giving away cloud storage. The eight-year-old company, valued at $10 billion, had 300 million registered users a year ago; now it’s got 400 million. Its two-year-old effort to make money from business users has been less impressive. While Dropbox led the $904 million global market for business file-sharing last year with about a 24 percent share, No.?2 Box and No.?3 Microsoft each took about 21 percent and doubled their slice of the pie, growing almost twice as fast, according to researcher IDC.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetGloves Off in China as Banks, Alibaba Invade Each Other’s Turf: This week, Alibaba is launching MYbank, an online lender that will tap into Chinese savers’ record $7.8 trillion of deposits and a banking revenue stream that’s forecast to double by 2020. Banks have been striking back by pushing into the business Ma pioneered in China, online malls. The moves are blurring the lines between banking and e-commerce as China’s government continues encouraging competition in the finance industry and as Chinese increasingly use computers and mobile phones to bank and shop. “China’s banks have woken up and realized that the challenge from Alibaba’s entry into banking is for real,” said David He, a Hong Kong-based partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group Inc. “For them, doing e-commerce is a defense as well as a counterattack.” Banking giant ICBC, which as the world’s most profitable company dwarfs Alibaba’s net income by more than 10 times, set up a platform allowing retailers to sell the bank’s customers wine, shampoo, appliances and more. China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and others are also getting into the action. ICBC’s site, called Easy to Buy, is forecasting sales of 300 billion yuan this year, after tallying 130 billion yuan so far since January. By comparison at Alibaba, its Tmall logged 763 billion yuan in sales last year. JD.com ranked second at 260 billion yuan.Report suggests millions of Uber rides in China are fakes reported by drivers in order to collect Uber’s high driver subsidies.: A new report on Chinese tech site Tencent Tech suggests that millions of Uber’s booked rides in the country are fakes – fraudulent fares reported by drivers in order to collect Uber’s high driver subsidies. Faking fares – which some drivers refer to as “acupuncture” – works like this: first, you buy an Uber driver account. There are plenty available for sale on sites like Taobao, and many even come with helpful “how to fake rides” guides. Once you’ve got your account, you partner up with a passenger using the consumer Uber app. With location services turned off, the passenger submits a fare from point A to point B. You drive the fare with no passenger, return the money paid by the passenger, and then split the driver subsidies Uber will pay you – which may be several times the price of the fare itself. This “acupuncture” phenomenon it doesn’t only affect Uber. But drivers told Tencent Tech that because Uber’s subsidies are the highest, virtually all of the faking right now is taking place on Uber’s platform because it is the most profitable. Uber reportedly does have the technological capability to shut down fake rides entirely, but is concerned that doing so would slow its genuine organic growth because being overly strict could result in false positives, banning real drivers and passengers who aren’t cheating the system.Qualcomm in Venture With Chinese Chip Maker: China’s largest maker of chips has a new plan to help it close a wide gap with rivals, and the company has found some unlikely partners to help. The company, the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, also known as S.M.I.C., said on Tuesday that it would form a new company with a leading Belgian microelectronics research center and Qualcomm, the American chip giant, to help it develop and produce new generations of advanced semiconductors that work as the brains of numerous electronics products, like smartphones and servers. Four months ago, China imposed a $975 million fine on Qualcomm, saying it violated anti-monopoly law, and forced it to reduce sharply the licensing fees it charges Chinese smartphone makers for its communications chips. This really is Qualcomm playing nice with the Chinese government,” said Mark Hung, a semiconductor analyst with Gartner. Chinese companies like SMIC. have greatly lagged behind rivals like Samsung Electronics and Intel, partly because of export restrictions on the sophisticated tools and machines required to produce the most advanced chips. In 2013, China imported $232 billion worth of semiconductor materials, more than it spent on petroleum. To close the gap, Beijing has pledged a huge amount of resources. “The Chinese government has been very persistent and insistent in their policies. They want local chip manufacturing there, and this is another leak in the dike. It’s another part of the steady progress on their side.”Here is an MP3 version of this snippet on SoundCloudIndia's government proposes tax benefits for merchants for promoting card payments: Government today proposed income tax benefits for people making payments through credit or debit cards and doing away with transaction charges on purchase of petrol, gas and rail tickets with plastic money. In a draft paper for moving towards cashless economy and reduce tax avoidance, the government also proposed to make it mandatory to settle high value transactions of more than Rs 1 lakh through electronic mode. In order to incentivise shopkeepers, it has proposed tax rebate to them provided they accept a significant value of sales through debit or credit cards. The proposals are aimed at building a transactions history of an individual to enable improved credit access and financial inclusion, reduce tax avoidance and check counterfeiting of currency. “Tax benefits in terms of income tax rebates to be considered to consumers for paying a certain proportion of their expenditure through electronic means,” said that draft proposals for facilitating electronic transactions on which the government has invited comments till June 29. The paper said the tax benefits could be provided to merchants for accepting electronic payments. “An appropriate tax rebate can be extended to a merchant if at least say 50 per cent value of the transactions is through electronic means. Alternatively, 1-2 per cent reduction in value added tax could be considered on all electronic transactions by the merchants,” it added.Tech Titans Come Together To Develop Common Container Standard: Docker, CoreOS, Google, Microsoft and Amazon are now working on a new standard for software containers with the help of the Linux Foundation. Docker may have become synonymous with containers, but it’s not the only container format around and not everybody agrees that it should become the standard format. Docker and CoreOS had looked like they were on a collision course, and having even more container formats wasn’t likely going to help the overall ecosystem. Now, however, the two companies are going to work together with other stakeholders on the Open Container Project (OCP), which will be housed under the Linux Foundation. The OCP is a nonprofit organization that is “chartered to establish common standards for software containers.” The Docker container format and runtime will form the basis of the new standard, and Docker is donating both the draft specifications and the code around its image format and runtime engine to get the project started. The main idea here is that developers should be able to package their applications in a container and be confident that it will run in any runtime, whether that’s Docker, CoreOS’s rkt, or projects like Kurma or Jetpack. That standard should be vendor neutral and development should happen out in the open. Containers are isolated user instances that allow applications to be deployed easily; Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces to allow independent \"containers\" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines.As Quick as a Taylor Swift Tweet, Apple Had to Change Its Tune: Taylor Swift’s victory in a one-day battle against Apple this week showed she has a rare power to influence the music business itself, at a time of deep anxiety among artists big and small about the value of their work. On Sunday morning, Ms. Swift wrote a diplomatic but stern Tumblr post taking Apple to task for not paying royalties on test drives of its new streaming music service, set to open on June 30. “We don’t ask you for free iPhones,” she wrote. “Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.” By midnight Sunday, Apple — one of the most powerful companies in the world — had capitulated to the 25-year-old pop star, saying it would pay royalties on all music for the three-month trials. One of its senior executives, Eddy Cue, even said he called Ms. Swift personally to give her the news. The backdrop to that decision was much more complex than the quick exchange might have indicated. For more than a week, independent labels around the world had been complaining about Apple’s proposed terms, saying that even for 90 days, a big drop in revenue from Apple — by far the music industry’s largest sales outlet — could be devastating. But even though Mr. Cue carefully noted in interviews that the company’s decision had been made with those labels in mind, its hurried announcement late Sunday suggested that it was Ms. Swift’s shaming that led Apple to change its tune. “She is the most powerful person in the music industry,” said David Lowery of the bands Cracker and Camper Van Beethoven, and an advocate for artists’ rights. “She is able to bring the debate to the mainstream.”Uber Is Negotiating a $2 Billion Credit Line With Banks: Uber is negotiating a $2 billion credit line from a group of Wall Street banks. The car-booking company that has roiled transportation markets worldwide by letting people hail rides from their smartphones, had initially sought a $1 billion revolving loan before boosting the size as more banks sought to participate, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. San Francisco-based Uber raised $1.6 billion in convertible debt at the beginning of the year from Goldman Sach’s wealth-management clientsAn MP3 version of this snippet is hereHow Oculus and Cardboard Are Going to Rock the Travel Industry: Relegated to geeky fantasy for years, Virtual Reality hardware is suddenly cheap, portable, and there for the travel-brand taking. Travel companies such as Thomas Cook, Qantas Airways, and Destination BC in Canada are also creating their own promotional VR videos. Currently, in 10 select Thomas Cook store locations in the U.K., Germany, and Belgium, you can strap on a Gear VR headset and try your tour before you buy: Walk through the billowing blue curtains of a Santorini hotel balcony, ride a helicopter above Manhattan's skyline. This year Cook has seen VR-promoted New York excursion revenue increase 190 percent. The next step, according to Ryan, is to go beyond brick-and-mortar stores and deliver VR brochures into homes.China to promote cross-border e-commerce as incomes rise: China will increase support for cross-border e-commerce as the world's second-largest economy shifts from manufacturing to higher-value services, the government said. The government released policy guidelines on Saturday that include tax policies aimed at boosting domestic consumption and pilot projects to ease overseas payments. Chinese e-commerce firms will be given state support on international projects while credit insurance services will also be introduced. Customs will streamline clearance of goods and quality supervision agencies will allow collective declaration, examination and release of goods. There will be tax sweeteners on e-commerce retail exports and settlement of payments in yuan will be promoted, it added. The policy document followed Friday's announcement that China will allow full foreign ownership of some e-commerce business to boost competitiveness.Chinese firms pour money into U.S. Research and Development in shift to innovation: Surging investment by Chinese companies in U.S. research labs is yielding a fast-growing trove of patents, part of a push to mine America for ideas to help China shift from being the world's factory floor to a driver of innovation. Largely absent from American research hubs a decade ago, Chinese firms including Huawei and ZTE Corp are now using U.S. researchers to create patents ranging from new software to internet infrastructure, according to an analysis of Thomson Reuters' global intellectual property database. Patented inventions by Chinese firms that involved at least one U.S. researcher roughly doubled worldwide in each of the last three years, reaching 910 in 2014.Attack Gave Chinese Hackers Privileged Access to U.S. Systems: Undetected for nearly a year, the Chinese intruders executed a sophisticated attack that gave them “administrator privileges” into US government networks. The hackers began siphoning out a rush of data after constructing what amounted to an electronic pipeline that led back to China, investigators told Congress last week in classified briefings. The hackers’ ultimate target: the one million or so federal employees and contractors who have filled out a form known as SF-86, which is stored in a different computer bank and details personal, financial and medical histories for anyone seeking a security clearance. “This was classic espionage, just on a scale we’ve never seen before from a traditional adversary”US carrier Sprint bows to net neutrality, saying it won’t throttle data anymore: To make sure it stays on the right side of net neutrality, Sprint will no longer slow down its customers' mobile data when its cell sites are congested, the company says. The decision is an early sign that the federal government's new rules for Internet providers are having an effect. Sprint's policy, which it said lasted for less than a year, was to slow down mobile data temporarily for data hogs in a congested area. The throttling affected the heaviest 5 percent of data users covered by a given cell site, and when the congestion eased, the restrictions were lifted.Here is an MP3 version of this snippetAlibaba Finance Arm Is Valued Above $40 Billion in Latest Funding Round: Alibaba’s finance affiliate, which runs China’s biggest online payments business, closed a private placement valuing the unit at more than $40 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter. Ant Financial sold stakes to external investors, including China Development Bank Capital Company. China’s National Social Security Fund has become a strategic investor, the finance arm said on its official microblog account, without giving details of the investment. The pension fund acquired about 5 percent. Ma spun off the finance operations into a new company he controls in 2011, citing the risk of foreign ownership restrictions. Yahoo and SoftBank held a majority of Alibaba at the time. Prior to Alibaba's record $25 billion IPO in September, the companies struck a new deal that entitled the e-commerce operator to a share of earnings at Ant Financial, which is moving into new businesses, including money-market funds. Alipay, which has more than 800 million registered users, is a service similar to PayPal. Alibaba is entitled to either a third of Ant Financial shares or a one-time payout equal to 37.5 percent of the equity value, according to Alibaba’s IPO prospectus. Alibaba also holds perpetual claim to 37.5 percent of Ant Financial’s pretax earnings until it receives a third of the financial arm’s equity.Chinese government deals help nurse Alibaba's bottom dog cloud business: Alibaba is an underdog in the global cloud computing industry, but it has one thing going for it: it's Chinese. The firm scored a minor deal with China's northeastern port city of Dalian to build a cloud computing center and provide online government services such as bill payment.The pact is a small part of a growing portfolio of similar cloud services tie-ups between Alibaba and government bodies around China and comes against a backdrop of Beijing's deepening paranoia about foreign technology. The domestic alliances will help Alibaba's cloud unit Aliyun, literally \"Ali Cloud\", build scale and gain experience before any global campaign to challenge market leaders Amazon.com, Microsoft and Google. \"China wants control of its information, of its data, of its news, of its technology food chain, and so there are huge opportunities.\" For the time being, Aliyun is small.It accounted for just 1 percent of Alibaba's overall revenue for the year ended March 31. But it says in China it has the biggest market share in cloud computing. Aliyun has forged cloud agreements with more than a dozen Chinese provinces and cities including Hainan, Guangdong, Tianjin and Shanghai. It also works with China Meteorological Administration, China Central Government Procurement Center and the state railway service center. The deals range from developing cloud storage solutions to helping the government of the southern province of Guizhou gather and crunch data to optimize its traffic lights. Aliyun in April announced a deal with state oil and gas giant Sinopec, to create a cloud system to track its petrochemical production chain and emissions. Cheng Jing, an Aliyun director who deals with government agencies, said his primary consideration was the bottom line. \"First, we have to be sure that our services can make money. If these services can also promote Ali's relationship with the government then that's a good thing.\"A Fearless,“Fail fast, fail often” Culture Fuels America's Tech Culture, and Why Europe Trails: Here’s a stark comparison: In the United States, three of the top 10 companies by market capitalization are technology companies founded in the last half-century: Apple, Microsoft and Google. In Europe, there are none among the top 10. There are institutional and structural barriers to innovation in Europe, like smaller pools of venture capital and rigid employment laws that restrict growth.Often overlooked in the success of American start-ups is the even greater number of failures. “Fail fast, fail often” is a Silicon Valley mantra, and the freedom to innovate is inextricably linked to the freedom to fail. In Europe, failure carries a much greater stigma than it does in the United States. Bankruptcy codes are far more punitive, in contrast to the United States, where bankruptcy is simply a rite of passage for many successful entrepreneurs. There is also little or no stigma in Silicon Valley to being fired; Steve Jobs himself was forced out of Apple. Europeans are also much less receptive to the kind of truly disruptive innovation represented by a Google or a FacebookHere is an MP3 version of this snippetProfitable and Growing Fast, Fitbit Prices I.P.O. at $4.1 Billion Valuation, Above Top of Its Range: Fitbit begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol FIT. The company, which sells popular wearable fitness-tracking devices like the Fitbit Surge bracelet, priced its initial public offering at $20 a share on Wednesday, a dollar above its already heightened price range of $17 to $19 a share. At that level, the company will raise $732 million for itself and its selling stockholders after increasing the number of shares to be sold to 36.6 million from 34.5 million. The price values Fitbit at $4.1 billion. Its debut is a bet that consumers will continue to buy fitness bands as other, more complex smartwatches like the Apple Watch and various Android competitors hit stores. In addition to tracking users’ heart rates and steps, the newer devices offer access to email, text messages and other applications. Fitbit faces another challenge in the form of legal fights from a rival, Jawbone, which filed two lawsuits over the last month. One accuses the company of patent infringement, which could lead to a ban on importing Fitbit devices or important parts. The other accuses Fitbit of poaching employees who then illicitly stole confidential information from their former employer. Fitbit has denied those accusations. Investors for now appear undaunted by those challenges. Last year, Fitbit earned $131.8 million, reversing a nearly $52 million loss in the previous year. Its sales more than tripled during that same period, to $745.4 million.GitHub to Seek $2 Billion Valuation in Latest Funding Round: GitHub, a startup that helps companies and developers build software, is seeking to raise about $200 million in a new Series B round that may value San Francisco-based GitHub about $2 billion. The company works as a social coding platform, where a software developer can display a project and others can contribute. The company says more than 8 million people use the service, and it charges monthly subscriptions to store programming source code.Uber driver is an employee, not a contractor, California regulators say: California's Labor commission has ruled that an Uber driver was an employee, not a contractor, a potentially costly precedent for the ride-sharing company. Uber unsuccessfully argued to the commission that drivers on its ride-hailing smartphone platform aren't employees, because it doesn't set their hours or force them to pick up riders. The commission ruled that Uber was more than a passive platform connecting drivers and riders. Instead, the commission said in its ruling, Uber is “involved in every aspect of the operation,” vetting drivers, setting standards and establishing non-negotiable rates. The company can also kick drivers off the service if customers give them a low rating. Currently, Uber drivers take an 80 percent cut of fares, but they cover their own costs and pay their own taxes. The ruling could set a broad precedent if it is upheld. For Uber, the implications of counting its drivers as employees rather than contractors are substantial. It would suddenly have to pay for employees' health care benefits, worker’s compensation and payroll taxes, and be on the hook for costs like gas and car maintenance.Location Intelligence firm AdNear expands into Europe: Bangalore and Singapore-based AdNear Pte Ltd, which helps brands reach out to audiences by analysing time-bound location data, has ventured into Europe by establishing a beachhead in London. The company has appointed Ken Parnham, former managing director of data privacy management company TrustE, as general manager of Europe. AdNear was founded by Anil Mathews, who is also the company’s CEO, back in 2009. The company’s advertising platform is built on a proprietary hybrid geo-location platform, which helps to provide location awareness on mobile phones without GPS or operator assistance. It serves clients in India, Singapore, Australia and other Asia-Pacific countries. AdNear leverages real geo-location, combined with consumer behaviour, to target relevant users within a geo-fence. All ads are displayed within mobile apps and they ensure further engagement as users can find their way to the advertised stores and use coupons among other things. Recently, the company had raised Series B funding of $19 million from Telstra Ventures, Global Brain, Sequoia Capital and JPM Private Equity Group. In November 2012, Adnear had raised $6.3 million in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital and Canaan Partners.4 Microsoft Executives to Leave in Top-Level Shake-Up: Four senior Microsoft executives, including Stephen Elop and Mark Penn, will leave the technology company in the biggest organizational shake-up yet under Satya Nadella, its chief executive. Mr. Nadella said that three of the departures were related to his decision to organize the company’s engineering efforts into fewer groups. The three executives leaving as a result are Mr. Elop, former chief executive of Nokia, who has been leading Microsoft’s devices group; Eric Rudder, leader of its advanced technology and education efforts; and Kirill Tatarinov, head of its business solutions group. While Microsoft has a long history of bureaucratic reshufflings, they do not typically involve the departure of so many executives at once. Mr. Nadella’s decision to merge several groups into others effectively left a handful of Microsoft executives without clear roles. By far, the most significant of the changes is the merging of devices, which includes Xbox, Surface tablets, smartphones and other hardware products, with the Windows organization under Mr. Myerson. By grouping hardware and operating systems under one leader, the move undoes part of the reorganization by Mr. Ballmer.Here is an audio version of this snippetHow A US Interest Rate Hike Could Deflate The Tech Boom: The technology industry has benefited from low interest rates, contributing to the creation of more than 100 unicorns, startups valued at more than $1 billion. Now that economists predict a rate hike as soon as September, investors question whether the move will do what seemingly nothing else has been able to accomplish -- cool off the sector.The U.S. central bank has kept benchmark rates near zero since 2008, before companies such as Uber, Snapchat and Pinterest even existed. That means most of today’s startups haven’t been tested in an economy in which borrowing costs fluctuate. Young companies may find it harder to raise capital. It also could add stock-market volatility, making it harder to hold an initial public offering. Even the biggest beneficiaries of the boom see a shakeout coming. Chris Sacca, an investor in companies including Twitter and Uber, said too much money is flowing to technology startups that will fail in a coming industry slowdown. “Bad deals are being done,” Sacca said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “It’s kind of inevitable that the funds right now that are putting a lot of this money to work here aren’t going to see it all back.”Uber is getting serious about maps, and it has poached the former head of Google Maps to lead the charge.: Brian McClendon, a Google engineering VP and 10-year company veteran, will be overseeing Uber’s new Pittsburgh center, staffed by engineers recruited from Carnegie Mellon’s National Robotics Engineering Center. Uber has taken several steps recently to strengthen its mapping technology. In March it acquired deCarta, a nearly decade old company that powers the mapping technology behind location-based services like General Motors’ OnStar navigation system. Uber also recently put in a bid for Nokia’s Here mapping technology, going head to head with the likes of a consortium of German automotive companies for the property. Almost everything Uber does relies on geospatial software, from its estimated car arrival times to directions for drivers to its UberPool system for matching travelers who want to share rides. Understandably, the company doesn’t want to rely solely on Google and Apple, as it currently does, for the technology that underlies its system, particularly in a time when Google’s and Uber’s initiatives are starting to overlap. McClendon was one of the rare Googlers to join the search giant via an acquisition and stay for several years. He arrived in 2004 with the purchase of Keyhole, part of a trio of companies Google swept up before the public birth of Maps. Keyhole’s technology became Google Earth. Its co-founder, John Hanke, also stayed at Google, where, in 2010, he was given oversight of the internal incubator Niantic Labs. McClendon was given purview over Google’s “Geo” products, which include Maps, Earth and Street View. He was one of the few execs to lead a product portfolio who was not an SVP or part of the inner circle of CEO Larry Page. Amid Google’s sweeping reorganization last October, McClendon was replaced by Jen Fitzpatrick, another engineering VP, who has been with Google since 1999. His mapping background made him a prime recruitment target for Uber.Google Highlights Cloud Capabilities as GCP Beats AWS, Microsoft to Win HTC as Customer: At an event Tuesday for Google Cloud Platform — Google’s name for the computing, storage and networking it sells to business — Google will name the Taiwanese phone maker HTC as a customer. HTC has used Google to build a new kind of computing architecture that enables smartphone apps to update data fast and reliably to many devices at once, and look efficient even when the phones get poor reception. HTC also looked at the cloud offerings of AWS and Microsoft Azure, along with IBM and Alibaba. Google was the dark horse, because it does not operate in China, and HTC wanted to be everywhere in the world. Google’s technical dedication won the day. “The other salesmen just wanted to take orders,” Google is talking more openly about companies that use its cloud business, and revealing more about its computing resources, perhaps the largest on the planet. These include disclosures about Google’s ultrafast fiber network, its big data resources, and the computers and software it has built for itself. The disclosures follow earlier moves by Google Cloud Platform, as the search company’s cloud computing business is called, to show off its data analysis capabilities. The aim is to position Google as a company capable of handling the biggest and toughest computational exercises, lightning fast. Each cloud player is now reflecting the nature of its core business. Amazon, a retailer, is offering computing at scale and ease of use in data analysis. Microsoft, with decades of business ties, stresses its interoperability with current systems and data tools. And IBM has lots of high-level data analysts. Google Cloud Platform has built out specialties in areas like manufacturing, genomics and media to handle industry-specific needs on a global basis.Airbnb Says Chinese Travelers Are Fastest-Growing Users: Airbnb is drawing more customers from China, Chief Technology Officer Nathan Blecharczyk said. The firm has built relationships with Chinese consumers when they travel abroad, he said. The group represents Airbnb's fastest growing category, according to Blecharczyk.The San Francisco-based company doubled the number of properties it lists in Cuba to 2,000 within 45 days after debuting in the country, Blecharczyk said. Airbnb, which started in the country after President Barack Obama took steps to open relations with the communist nation, said last month Cuba was its fastest-growing market.Here is an audio version of this MP3Companies - Including IBM and Cloudera - Are Moving On From Big Data Technology Hadoop: There is increasing evidence that Hadoop — one of the most important technologies of the past several years for big data analysis —is not keeping up with the world that created it. On Monday, IBM, which has champion ed Hadoop and put it at the center of its big data strategy, announced it is working on a faster data-processing engine, called Spark. Additionally, a senior executive at Cloudera, probably the largest Hadoop company, said Cloudera is prepared to see key parts of Hadoop diminish in importance, and was increasingly distributing Spark. Hadoop is an open-source architecture that drew heavily on work published by Google in 2004, in particular two different papers on managing, processing and generating very large data sets. Google’s File System and MapReduce, the subjects of the two papers, were based on computing systems that were not organized around drawing a lot of computer memory in a short time; there just hadn’t been that much data before. It did a good job, but it had inherent limitations, since it was adapting one style of computing to another. Spark, by contrast, assumes a world where digital information comes in massive volumes from web browsers, sensors, phones and other things. Does that mean old Hadoop is dead, and with it companies like Cloudera and Hortonworks? Not so fast – they may have been planning for this day. “We’re already the largest distributor of Spark in the world, including Databricks,” said Mike Olson, chief strategy officer at Cloudera. “If MapReduce becomes less important in how people do big data, and it will, we will be there.” Cloudera, he said, has “reset in a smart way, ahead of the others,” by focusing on tools and services for other kinds of analysis besides Hadoop.Chinese Uber Rival Will Raise Funds at $15 Billion Valuation: Two recently merged taxi applications backed by Alibaba and Tencent are seeking to raise funds that value the company at $12 billion to $15 billion. The competing Didi and Kuaidi apps combined in February, and form China’s largest taxi and ride-sharing platforms after merging to limit the rising costs of competing with each other and Uber. Didi Kuaidi still runs separate apps that customers use to access their service, while combining their technology and data. Didi Kuaidi, accounts for 78 percent of ride bookings, while Uber has about 11 percent. Alibaba and Tencent own 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively, in the merged company and Tokyo-based SoftBank also has a stake. The new valuation would make Didi Kuaidi one of the most valuable startups in China after smartphone maker Xiaomi, valued at $45 billion. Meanwhile Uber has told investors it plans to invest $1 billion in China.The Growth Equity In Venture Capital: According to data by Dealogic, tech sector IPOs are off to their slowest start since 2009, totaling just $2.35 billion as compared to last year’s total of 62 IPOs valued at approximately $40.8 billion. Companies are now delaying their initial public offerings because they’re able to rely on private investors, such as those in the growth-equity sector, to help fund their next round of capital. Private funding is now filling their capital needs faster and making companies more profitable by raising the valuations. In fact, some companies that might have previously gone public in an effort to raise capital are now becoming acquired before ever hitting the public market. The technology industry is booming, and contrary to popular belief, it’s not just early-stage venture funding that’s steering the ship. Helping to propel this rapid expansion is actually another group of investors that specializes in growing established companies and taking them to the next level, aptly named “growth equity.” In the ecosystem of funding options, growth-equity investors tend to strategically focus on companies with proven technologies and established market adoption — many of which are already generating revenues between $5 million and $100 million. In recent years, growth equity has become its own asset class and is actively followed and monitored by investors. Growth equity enjoys the benefits of investing slightly later down the road in the growth of technology companies, thereby reducing the risk of future financing rounds, while at the same time avoiding the seniority of leverage utilized by private equity firms. The risk-adjusted results of this asset class indicate that better returns can be generated with lower associated risk. Additionally, growth-equity investors tend to be much more hands-on and often occupy seats on the boards of their portfolio companies. This helps to control and lessen the risk associated with investing at this stage. In some instances, growth-equity investors help provide liquidity to founding partners who might have been working for years with little to no return. They also offer the necessary guidance to structure growth-oriented deals that require more complex maneuvers, such as funding mergers and acquisitions.Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet, and archived snippets are here. Alibaba Plans to Create TBO, China’s Version of Netflix, HBO: Alibaba is planning to build China’s version of Netflix and HBO via a new service called Tmall Box Office, as it tries to service 600 million families craving more entertainment content. Tmall Box Office will be offered in about two months through Alibaba's set-top box and smart televisions that carry its operating system, including those manufactured by Haier Group. Some of the content will be produced by the company and some purchased overseas. Alibaba is on a buying spree as it tries to compete with Tencent Holdings for China’s $5.9 billion online video market. Alibaba Pictures Group Ltd. completed a $1.57 billion stake sale in Hong Kong to help finance potential acquisitions in June. Billionaire Chairman Jack Ma visited Hollywood in October to acquire more content. “We want to create a whole new family entertainment experience,” Liu said. “Our goal is to become like Netflix in the U.S, HBO in the U.S.” It was not clear how the service would fit with Youku Tudou, one of China's biggest video streaming platforms in which Alibaba bought a 16.5 percent stake last year. However, unlike the majority of domestic rivals, about 90 percent of TBO's content will be paid for, either by monthly subscription or on a show-by-show basis, Liu said. The remaining 10 percent would be free. Netflix itself is also considering an entry into China, a notoriously difficult task for foreign Internet companies. Reliance readies for an e-Commerce push - talks of B2B marketplace and mobile payments at AGM. Mukesh Ambani said Reliance Retail’s fashion and lifestyle format will roll out its e-commerce property before the end of this year. Reliance Jio, the wireless telephony and data services unit of RIL, is set to launch 4G services by December this year.  RIL will also use Reliance Jio’s internet infrastructure to roll out an e-commerce marketplace platform, group chairman Ambani said at the company’s 41st annual general meeting on Friday. Here’s a peek at upcoming JIO services: Jio Money – Digital payments and money transfer services including a digital wallet. Switch-and-Walk – an app that allows customers to seamlessly change phones. Jio Drive – a cloud app for storing, sync-ing and sharing content between devices and with friends. Jio Play – An HD TV service with hundreds of channels.  Jio Beats – a digital music streaming service, that also allows download and offline listening. Jio Mags - a collection of popular magazines. Jio News – news from leading news publishing houses across multiple languages and categories. Coding Boot Camp Enrollment Soars as Students Seek Tech Jobs. Graduates of computer coding schools will more than double this year, a signal of heightened interest in high-paid technology jobs. More than 16,000 students will graduate from programming boot camps, up from 6,740 in 2014, according to data from Course Report, a website that allows students to rate the schools. The intensive training programs teach students how to create websites and mobile apps in two to six months and cost as much as $21,000. The tech boot-camp industry is less than four years old and graduated about 2,000 students two years ago, according to Course Report. Graduates don’t receive diplomas or certificates. Their credentials are the software programs that they coded while in school. About three-quarters of students are placed in coding jobs within three months of graduating, Course Report said in August. Mean boot camp tuition is $11,063, about 10 percent higher than a year earlier, and ranges to as much as $21,000, Course Report said in a statement. Total boot camp industry revenue will be about $172 million in 2015, up from about $52 million last year, the statement said.Beset With Failures, Google Tries to Breathe New Life Into Android One - Appoints Caesar Sengupta as New Leader. Caesar Sengupta, a VP based in Singapore who once managed Chromebook globally, now oversees Android One. He is close to Sunder Pichai and is admired within the company, largely for his work on Chromebooks. “If there’s anyone at Google who understands the hardware partner ecosystem, it’s Caesar,” said Shailesh Nalawadi, who left Google two years ago to co-found Mavin, a mobile startup focused on reducing Internet access costs in markets like India. “He’s probably the best person to be working on this.” Last September, Google inaugurated Android One, a cheap smartphone line for emerging markets, with typical Google audacity: It was billed as the fix “for the next five billion” soon to come online. The initiative, which promised low-cost devices with the latest version of the Android operating system and Google’s full software imprint, was a point of pride within Google. Started in India, one of Google’s biggest markets and the birthplace of Android chief Sundar Pichai, it was counted among the many bids to spread Internet access globally. Android One began with a bang, thanks to the tremendous marketing dollars Google put behind it. But despite its scale, it has been a disappointment, beset by reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners, as well as misfires from the search company that has never quite cracked hardware, according to multiple people familiar with the project. Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet.Spotify Value Tops $8 Billion as Investors Bet on Streaming: Spotify Ltd. received a valuation topping $8 billion in its latest round of funding as the world’s largest subscription music-streaming service said its number of customers exceeded 75 million. The company raised $526 million from investors including Goldman Sachs, Baillie Gifford, Discovery Capital Management, Lansdowne Partners, Rinkelberg Capital and Senvest Capital for a valuation of $8.5 billion, a person familiar with the matter said. Phone carrier TeliaSonera said Wednesday it invested $115 million. In comparison, Pandora, which runs an ad-supported Web radio, and reported 79.2 million active listeners at the end of the first quarter,  has a market value of $3.6 billion. Spotify continues to amass funds as it tries to boost its subscription service before Apple Inc. gains more customers for its updated music offering, unveiled this week. Both Apple and Spotify give users access to more than 30 million songs, and each service costs $9.99 a month. With music purchases shrinking in stores and online, streaming has emerged as the industry’s primary source of growth. Record labels acknowledge its significance, while complaining streaming has failed to replace lost retail sales. Spotify now has more than 20 million paying subscribers and more than 75 million active users, it said in a statement on its website Wednesday. The company said it has paid more than $3 billion in royalties to artists and record labels since its start over six years ago.Microsoft Launches Giant Smart Whiteboard - Picks Unusual Place to Manufacture it - the U.S.: There is nothing ordinary about Surface Hub, a gargantuan touch-screen computer that Microsoft is about to start selling to companies as a high-tech replacement for conference room whiteboards. People in a meeting can scribble on the screen with a stylus and pan around an image using their hands. Everything on the screen, along with video images of meeting participants, can be shared over the Internet with people in other locations. The largest Surface Hub, measuring 84 inches diagonally, looks like an iPad that has gone through a growth spurt. The 4K resolution of the screen produces dazzling images. At $20,000 apiece, a price Microsoft plans to announce on Wednesday, it should. Just as unusual is where Microsoft is building the Surface Hub: Wilsonville, Oregon, just outside Portland and about 200 miles south of the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash. That puts the Surface Hub in a rare category, since most of Microsoft’s better-known devices, like the Xbox game console, are made overseas.In recent years, there has been a surge of optimism about the prospect of high-tech manufacturing jobs returning to the United States after some headline-grabbing moves, like Apple’s decision to build its Mac Pro computer in Texas starting in 2013. But they remain outliers in an industry that has outsourced to Asia the making of everything from game consoles to smartphones. The Surface Hub, though, is an illustration of an exotic tech product that its makers believe can be manufactured cost-effectively in the United States. The product is so unusual — representing one of the largest touch screens of its kind — that Microsoft could not find existing assembly lines in Asia to build it on, the company said. At 220 pounds, the largest Surface Hub is expensive to ship long distances. And its already hefty price means any additional labor costs associated with making it in the United States will be harder for customers to detect.Hackers May Have Obtained Names of Chinese With Ties to U.S. Government. Chinese hackers who attacked the databases of the Office of Personnel Management may have obtained the names of Chinese relatives, friends and frequent associates of American diplomats and other government officials, information that Beijing could use for blackmail or retaliation. Federal employees who handle national security information are required to list some or all of their foreign contacts, depending on the agency, to receive high-level clearances. Investigators say that the hackers obtained many of the lists, and they are trying to determine how many of those thousands of names were compromised. “They are pumping this through their databases just as the N.S.A. pumps telephone data through their databases,” said James Lewis, a cyberexpert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It gives the Chinese the ability to exploit who is listed as a foreign contact. And if you are a Chinese person who didn’t report your contacts or relationships with an American, you may have a problem.” Officials have conceded in the briefings that most of the compromised data was not encrypted, though they have argued that the attacks were so sophisticated and well hidden that encryption might have done little good.Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippetGoogle Talent Departs for Unicorn Herd: Cloudera taps Google VP as Engineering Head, DropBox poaches Neal Mohan for top job: Cloud analytics software company Cloudera said today it has named Daniel Sturman as its VP of engineering. Sturman previously spent eight years at Google, where as VP of engineering he was in charge of keeping its computing infrastructure for services like Google Compute Engine and Google App Engine. Neal Mohan, Google’s VP for display and video advertising, is leaving for the top product job at Dropbox. He is part of a wave of execs departing the search engine in recent months for fast-growing, pre-IPO startups. More recently, Uber claimed Tom Fallows, who had led Google’s same-day delivery service, in November, followed by communication and policy chief Rachel Whetstone. Jawbone nabbed Fallows’s boss, Sameer Samat. Indian e-commerce unicorn Flipkart snatched two Googlers: The VP of product at Motorola and the person who ran the low-cost handset Android One project. On the smaller startup side, the ads product head at YouTube recently headed to Luxe, an on-demand parking startup. There’s more, but you get the idea. Google downplays exits, citing them as regular industry churn. But they come as Google’s core business faces rising threats and fears that it has grown too large and too uninspired to retain ambitious top tech talent. Apparently, the Google bench is not as rewarding for some as the thrill of a unicorn ride.Tinder Goes Through A Small Round Of Layoffs; spring-cleaning, not restructuring, company says. Tinder — one of the most popular dating apps currently available across the globe — laid off around 10 percent of its staff last week. TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that the company laid off six members of the 60-65 member team, including three marketing employees and three engineers. TechCrunch was told this wasn’t part of a re-structuring, or even a result of leadership changes with new CEO Chris Payne and VP of Engineering Hugh Williams, but rather a spring-cleaning of sorts. Tinder has gone through much larger transitions before, including a lawsuit waged by former VP of Marketing Whitney Wolfe, the resignation of CMO Justin Mateen, and the transition of Sean Rad from CEO to President. Since then, Chris Payne has joined the team as CEO and Hugh Williams has taken over the engineering squad. The first year of monetization can be tricky for any social startup, and with the complexities of Tinder Plus — ads, premium features, oddball pricing, etc. — it would make sense to double-check that the team is as lean as possible.Tesla CFO retires; Firm Will Start Delivering Model X SUV in 3 to 4 Months, Says Elon Musk;  Tesla Motors  will begin deliveries of the Model X sport utility vehicle in three to four months, keeping close to the timeline the electric-car maker laid out earlier this year, Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said. “The Model X will be a better SUV than the Model S is a sedan,” Musk, 43, said Tuesday at Tesla’s annual shareholders meeting, held at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. Musk said he’s been driving the latest prototype of the Model X, which Tesla first unveiled as a concept in February 2012 and previously sought to have ready by the end of 2014. More recently, Tesla told investors that initial deliveries to customers, several of whom have been waiting for more than three years, would begin late in the third quarter. Car-based SUVs are popular among female drivers, and in a January interview with Bloomberg, Musk said that the Model X is drawing more than half its orders from women. This is a contrast from the predominantly male customer base for its Model S sedan and the Roadster, which the Palo Alto, California-based company no longer sells. Tesla is also working on the Model 3, to be released in 2017 with a starting price of roughly $35,000. In addition, the company is readying another software upgrade for the Model S, including so-called autopilot driver-assist technology, and “may be able to get it out to early-access customers by the end of this month,” Musk said. Musk has said the company probably won’t turn net income positive until annual sales reach 500,000. “I expect we’ll achieve profitability in 2020,” he said. Musk is by far Tesla’s largest shareholder with 22 percent. He said in February that at the rate it’s growing, if all goes right, Tesla in a decade could be worth as much as Apple Inc., the world’s largest company by market valuation, is now. Musk also said CFO Deepak Ahuja will retire at the end of this year. Ahuja has been Tesla’s CFO since 2008, coming from Ford Motor and seeing Tesla through its June 2010 initial public offering. He said he’s retiring to pursue other life goals.Geek shortage stymies Israel's Tech Boom as Soviet emigre engineers retire, fewer youth study advanced science. Israel's technology miracle is threatened by a dearth of people in the very professions that made it happen: engineers and computer scientists. Companies say finding qualified workers is one of their biggest problems. And the shortage may worsen as fewer students sign up for the most advanced math classes, the building block for tech careers. This in an economy whose health depends on exports—about one-third of them from technology companies. One explanation for the shortage: Engineers who emigrated from the former Soviet Union in the 1990s are retiring. \"We don't truly appreciate that immigration,'' says Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. \"Without that I'm not sure we would be 'Start-Up Nation'.Meanwhile, fewer of Israel's youth are choosing to study advanced math, and there's no increase in those studying advanced science, in part put off by the level of difficulty that could bring down overall grades. The number of high school students matriculating in advanced math dropped by a quarter from 2006, to 9,350 in 2014, according to the Trump Foundation, dedicated to improving education in Israel. Almost a year ago, a ministerial committee drew up a program to increase skilled manpower for the industry. Its plan includes recruiting more Israeli Arabs into the industry, training ultra-Orthodox men and women, luring Israeli engineers abroad to return home, and making it easier for non-Israelis to get work visas. It must be approved by the new cabinet and could be passed later this year. Some parts are in place: About 300 academics were persuaded to return to Israel last year out of 4,300 who registered as willing to do so.IBM plans Data Analytics push - bets on Spark, open-source software project that aims to be Hadoop successor.IBM has created a Technology Center in San Francisco to focus on a free open-source software project called Spark, according to IBM executive Rob Thomas. IBM hired 20 people within the last month, Thomas said in a video posted online June 3. “We’re going to be scaling this up to hundreds of people that are just focused on Spark open source and how we evolve that for the enterprise,” Thomas said. Spark is a framework developed originally at the University of California at Berkeley that helps companies process large amounts of data rapidly, by storing information within the fast memory of computers. It is seen by many in Silicon Valley as a potential successor to Hadoop, which has spawned a variety of companies including Cloudera, MapR Technologies and Hortonworks. “This is a much more significant bet than even what we have done on Hadoop to be frank,” Thomas said. “We think Spark is going to be enormous and change the face of enterprise IT.”Microsoft drops the price of the Xbox One and introduces a 1TB console; will sell $25 adapter that allows streaming games from console to PC. Microsoft announced Tuesday that it's dropping the price of the 500 gigabite Xbox One to $349, which had previously been advertised as a \"promotional\" price drop from $399. Now, Microsoft will offer a new 1 terabyte model -- that's double the storage of the old standard model -- for $399 instead, the company said in a blog post. The Xbox is still locked in a battle with Sony's PlayStation to control the console world, and this is a clear play to appeal to hardcore gamers. As gaming guide Kotaku and others have reported, Sony is, in fact, expected to release a 1 TB version of the PlayStation soon. Microsoft also had some more news on its growing efforts to mix Xbox and PC gaming; a major feature of its upcoming operating system is that users can stream games from their console to their computer. To that end, Microsoft also announced it will sell a $25 adapter that will allow players to use their wireless controllers with their current computers. The company has redesigned the controller to allow players to plug their gaming headsets into the controller, which gives them the option to control settings such as the volume of their microphone or the game's audio while they play. Microsoft has also improved the quality of the sound that comes through the controller. The new controller doesn't mean, however, that you have to buy all new headsets or other accessories. \"All existing controller accessories will work with the updated controller,\" the company said.China's big biotech bet starting to pay off as country's patent portfolio burgeons. Years of pouring money into its laboratories, wooing scientists home from overseas and urging researchers to publish and patent is starting to give China a competitive edge in biotechnology, a strategic field it sees as ripe for \"indigenous innovation.\" The vast resources China can throw at research and development - overall funding more than quadrupled to $191 billion in 2005-13 and the Thousand Talents Program has repatriated scientists - allow China to jump quickly on promising new technologies, often first developed elsewhere. These efforts were illustrated vividly in April - not without controversy - when scientists at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou published results of a ground-breaking experiment to alter the DNA of human embryos using new gene editing technology. Data compiled by Thomson Innovation, a Thomson Reuters unit, shows China is a growing force in gene editing, with a burgeoning patent portfolio. More than 50 Chinese institutions are patenting in the field, led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, universities, the Anhui Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Beijing Jifulin Biotech. Nearly a fifth of the 518 families of gene editing patents analyzed since 2004 were associated with Chinese entities. For top-tier institutions, \"the level of available resources is incredible in terms of the freedom, the flexibility that gives key leading Chinese scientists to move very, very fast on a given research track if a new opportunity arises\".Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet. Apple's WWDC 2015: notable announcements from the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference: Apple Streaming Music Service Launches June 30th At $9.99 A Month, $14.99 Family Plan.  iTunes App Store Passes 1.5M Apps, 100B Downloads, $30B Paid To Developers To Date. iOS 9 Is Coming This Fall - Yep, Apple Maps Will Include Transit Directions In iOS 9.

Apple Revives Ping As “Connect,” Letting Artists Share A Feed Of Music, Videos And Social Media. Uber Spends Heavily to Establish Itself in China. Fat with almost $6 billion in venture capital, Uber, based in San Francisco, is doling out bonuses up to three times the amount of its fares, in a bet that its exceptional rise in the United States can be matched in China. So far, its strategy is working, shattering prevailing assumptions that young American tech companies cannot compete against local rivals. In late May, Uber said it had created more than 60,000 jobs in China over the past month, with the spread of its service spurring protests from some taxi drivers. While China represents huge scale as a market, it has fended off the entry of just about every major Western technology start-up. Uber, a five-year-old company that operates in more than 310 cities and 58 countries worldwide, faces homegrown Chinese rivals like Didi Kuaidi, which has more than 90 percent of the market and is backed by two of the largest Chinese Internet companies, Alibaba and Tencent. It may also have to grapple with a fickle central government that could shut it out of the market overnight. Yet more affluent and cosmopolitan Chinese have flocked to Uber’s service, attracted by fares that are on average at least 35 percent cheaper than taxis, with the cars generally more luxurious than cabs and drivers who offer free water and are typically more polite. Uber is providing more than 100,000 rides a day in China, according to two people with knowledge of the company’s internal metrics, who declined to be identified because the numbers are confidential. That is about 10 percent of the total one million rides a day that Uber said it was getting companywide in December.Square Unveils Mobile Wallet-Friendly Credit Card Reader; Will Give Away 250,000 Devices To Drive Adoption. Square, the San Francisco-based payments processing start-up, unveiled a new credit card reader on Monday, one capable of accepting mobile payments like those made through Apple Pay and Android Pay, among other methods. The new reader, which Square said will be widely available this fall, operates wirelessly for merchants who want to accept contact-less mobile payments. It also accepts so-called EMV enabled Credit Cards, a technology that includes a chip built into credit cards for added security. Square said the new reader will cost $49. The company is giving away about a quarter of a million of the new devices to encourage adoption by small and medium-sized businesses. For Square, the timing of the release is crucial. Credit card processors and merchants across the greater retail industry are up against a deadline later this year, when merchants must switch over to accepting EMV-based credit cards. If they fail to do so, the merchants will become liable for any potential credit card fraud on the transactions they process. But to prepare for EMV — which stands for EuroPay, MasterCard and Visa, the major credit networks that created the new standard — merchants must update their payments acceptance terminals, a process that for some may prove costly. That is where companies like Square — along with rivals like First Data‘s Clover, Poynt and Shopify — are inserting themselves. To capitalize on the EMV shift, these companies are offering their next-generation payment-acceptance terminals to small and medium-sized businesses that are required to switch to updated technology in any case. Many larger retailers are already rebuilding their own in-house payments infrastructures to accept EMV transactions and, in many cases, mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Android Pay. But options like Square’s reader, as well as those like Clover and Poynt, cater to small businesses that need only buy an off-the-shelf hardware terminal to become EMV compliant. In the long run, that’s good for companies like Apple and Google. The more EMV readers small merchants buy, the more places those companies’ mobile wallets will be accepted.Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet.Warning: Some Unicorns May Be Smaller Than They Appear.Protections for Late Investors Can Inflate Start-Up Valuations. The recent proliferation of so-called unicorns — start-up technology companies valued at more than $1 billion — has been greeted variously as a sign of healthy innovation or an indication that valuations have become dangerously overheated. Led by the likes of the car-hailing service Uber at $41 billion and the home-rental website Airbnb at $10 billion, the global ranks of unicorns have more than doubled, to 102, over the last 15 months, according to PitchBook Data, which tracks private financial markets. Less noticed is that the reported valuations of many unicorns have been inflated by the terms of the private investments that set those valuations before any initial public offerings of stock — often with little or no disclosure of those terms. Increasingly, venture investors say, late-stage financing terms include extra protections, like a discount to the price of any eventual initial offering, a minimum return on investment or extra shares if the company later raises money at a lower valuation. Such protections are controversial among start-up investors. Early-stage investors warn they can jeopardize a company’s financial stability, diluting the value of their original stakes and worsening a company’s prospects in a downturn. But the protections appeal to company founders because they provide new cash at the highest nominal valuation, reducing dilution if all goes well. And later-stage investors argue that they provide valuable insurance. The protections, known among investors as structuring or ratcheting, can inflate a unicorn’s indicated valuation 10 percent to 25 percent and the phenomenon has been part of a general “frothiness” in late-stage valuations. Since the start of 2014, 11 technology companies have priced their initial offerings below the investment price of the last financing rounds before the offerings. In addition to Box, they include the software providers Apigee and Globant and the big-data manager Hortonworks. In addition, it was estimated that that more than two-fifths of venture-backed technology companies had fallen below their initial offering price in the same period.Managing Developers: Just Because You’re In Charge Doesn’t Mean You’re In Control. The great irony of management is that the higher up you go, the less actual control you have. When you are but a humble coder, you make the computer do exactly what you want; when you’re a manager, you only hope that people understand what you want, and then trust/pray that they do it both correctly and in a timely manner. The Shit Work Is Your Work. Basically a manager’s job is to make other people more productive. What’s one really good way to do that? Do the work that is getting in their way. Which means: find out what kind of important work your developers dislike the most, and do it for them. Don't BS. Unfortunately, as you probably already know, people suck. People flake, screw up, ignore you, pester you, disappear, quit, and/or lose faith in you, frequently for no good reason. But you know how people — surprisingly — often don’t suck? Not to get all wifty and woo on you, but this was the most surprising lesson of my professional career: once people learn that they can trust you, then you can usually trust them back. So don’t bullshit anyone, ever.Remittances at the Click of a Smartphone Button are disrupting traditional players like Western Union: A growing shift is taking place in how people send money to each other around the world. While the likes of Western Union have offered international money transfers for decades, new tech start-ups and traditional telecom operators are taking advantage of the rapid rise of smartphones in many emerging economies to reduce the barriers — and costs — of sending cash overseas. Analysts say the changes are shaking up the global remittance market, which will be valued at almost $600 billion this year, according to the World Bank. New technology, for example, has helped cut the price of sending traditional remittances in half, to an average of $4 for sending $100, according to the GSMA, a telecom trade body. Sending money can take just a few minutes. Individuals log into the companies’ online services either through a computer or — increasingly — a smartphone. They enter the recipients’ details and their own bank details, and submit the request. Transactions typically take less than a few hours, compared with several days for traditional remittance companies. Recipients receive a text message when the money is available for pickup or has been credited to their mobile money account. Because the operations are automated and don’t rely on outdated systems, operators can offer international remittances at cheaper rates. To send the money, people only need to type in another person’s cellphone number into their phone’s mobile money service, enter a password and confirm the transaction. These sort of mobile payments have not caught on in many Western countries. But mobile money is now a fixture across large parts of the developing world. With limited access to traditional bank accounts, people have often turned to services like M-Pesa — a mobile money offering from Vodafone, the European telecom giant — as the de facto method to pay for goods and send money to friends and family.Apple is set to introduce Apple Pay in Britain, The Telegraph reports. Apple is planning to introduce its mobile payment system, Apple Pay, to Britain this summer, The Telegraph reported on Saturday, citing industry sources. Apple is expected to make the announcement on Monday in San Francisco at its annual conference for developers, the paper said. The Telegraph said the iPhone already contains a wireless microchip similar to those found in contactless payment cards, which will allow Apple Pay users to pay by waving the handset over a terminal to pay. Transport for London, the paper said, was already accepting Apple Pay from American tourists.The confessions of a reformed technology evangelist - He was sure technology would save the world. Then he went to India. For a long time Kentaro Toyama was a believer in technological utopianism. He studied physics at Harvard and earned a PhD in computer science at Yale. Toyama went on to do research at Microsoft. The work was demanding, but something was missing. In 2004, when his boss asked if he was interested in opening a research center in India, Toyama accepted on the spot. He’d never even been to India. But he was hungry to make more of a direct contribution to society. Here was the chance to sprinkle tech fairy dust on a developing nation and watch success after success. Except it didn’t play out like that. The humans mattered a lot more than the technology, he found. Toyama settled on a new view of technology. It’s an amplifier of human intentions, not a cure-all for human problems. For technology to be a part of positive change, the environment it enters must already be moving in the right direction. Toyama believes it’s foolish to think education is about having content available to study. “The fundamental problem of education is not content, it’s motivation. You have to find a way to help productively direct the motivation of the student,” Toyama said. “The idea that they can do this just because we have fed it to them online possibly through some fancy interactive graphic I think is just a crazy notion.” He notes how Thomas Edison thought the motion picture would revolutionize our education system. “Television was supposed to uplift millions,” Toyama writes. “Instead, millions sit in thrall to the Kardashians.” Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet on SoundCloudThe Apple Watch will hit retail stores on June 26: Apple said it would start selling some models of its watch at its retail stores this month, and also roll out the gadget in seven more countries. The watch has been on display in Apple stores around the world since April 10, when it became available for preorder online and at shops including trendy fashion boutiques in Paris, London and Tokyo. Apple had directed people to order online, preventing long queues around its stores that have become a norm with the company's rollout of new products. Apple Watch will be launched in Italy, Mexico, Spain, South Korea, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan on June 26, the company said. The watch is currently available in the United States, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the UK. Apart from online stores, customers in these countries can also buy the devices at Apple's retail stores and some authorized resellers. The company has not given any sales figures for the watch since it began taking orders, but has often said demand was outstripping supply. \"The response to Apple Watch has surpassed our expectations in every way,\" said Jeff Williams, senior vice president of operations. \"We're also making great progress with the backlog of Apple Watch orders.\"Snapdeal, GoJavas to pick up return orders in 90 minutes: E-commerce marketplace Snapdeal, and QuickDel Logistics, which operates under the GoJavas brand, have launched a new service that will ensure pick up of return or replacement e-commerce orders within 90 minutes of intimation. The new service, christened ‘go-90′, has gone live in 15 cities, as per a press statement. GoJavas was previously a part of Jabong, a lifestyle e-tailer incubated by Rocket Internet. The move is seen as another step towards stimulating online shopping in the country since returns are seen as a major challenge. Reportedly, around 5-9 per cent of all e-commerce orders end up being returned in India.Alibaba has tied up with China's largest loan restructurer to sell bad debt online. Alibaba will cooperate with the biggest state-owned loan restructurer to dispose of more than 4 billion yuan ($645 million) of non-performing assets on its online shopping platform Taobao. China Cinda Asset Management, which announced the tieup with Ma last week, saw profits rise 32 percent to a record in 2014. China’s non-performing loans climbed by an unprecedented 140 billion yuan in the first quarter to 982.5 billion yuan, the most since 2008 and almost the size of Vietnam’s economy. UBS and Standard Chartered are among companies that bought stakes in Cinda before its 2013 public share sale as a stepping stone into the distressed asset market. Cinda’s market value of $23 billion is now larger than KKR’s $19.1 billion. Cinda already sold two bad loans on Alibaba’s retail site Taobao in April for a combined 24.5 million yuan, according to a China Banking Regulatory Commission statement at the time. Four more were auctioned last month for 31.4 million yuan. One of the soured loans auctioned in May was originally from Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. with a clothing company in the eastern Zhejiang province as the debtor. Cinda disclosed details such as the name of the borrower, the principal amount, accrued interest and guarantors of the loan on Taobao. Bidders were advised to look at the loan documents and check the collaterals before auction. Both individuals as well as institutions were allowed to bid. “Alibaba’s online loan auction platform broadens the investor base for bad loans and therefore will lead to better price discovery for distressed assets,” said Liao Qiang, a banking analyst at Standard & Poor’s in Beijing. The legal complexities involved in unwinding such debts and the need to divulge information publicly may limit growth in online auctions, according to KPMG’s Gleave. “Alibaba’s auction site is just a market place,” he said. “Whether that’s a good way to trade bad debts is still to be seen.”Yahoo Says Shutting Down Maps Service Site, Other Tools: Maps.yahoo.com will close at the end of June, Amotz Maimon, chief architect at the Sunnyvale, California-based company, said in a blog post. Yahoo will still support mapping as part of other services including search and the photo-sharing website Flickr. Yahoo also is paring back or ending support for other sites and services, including mail support for older versions of Apple Inc.’s iPhone operating system. The company is shuttering market-specific media properties, including Yahoo Music in France and Canada and the home page for the Philippines. In addition, it will end support for creation of Pipes, a Web-content gathering tool. Yahoo Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer is looking for ways to keep costs under control as she works to turn around the company she has led for almost three years. Computer Scientists Are Astir After Baidu Team Is Barred From A.I. Competition: A group of researchers at the Chinese web services company Baidu have been barred from participating in an international competition for artificial intelligence technology after organizers discovered that the Baidu scientists broke the contest’s rules. The competition, which is known as the “Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge,” is organized annually by computer scientists at Stanford University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Michigan. It requires that computer systems created by the teams classify the objects in a set of digital images into 1,000 different categories. The rules of the contest permit each team to run test versions of their programs twice weekly ahead of a final submission as they train their programs to “learn” what they are seeing. However, on Tuesday, the contest organizers posted a public statement noting that between November and May 30, different accounts had been used by the Baidu team to submit more than 200 times to the contest server, “far exceeding the specified limit of two submissions per week.” This year, Baidu announced that it had built a custom supercomputer named Minwa with the intention of dedicating it to the image recognition contest. Baidu researchers subsequently made a series of announcements about the success of the computer, including one playing up a result more accurate than an earlier score by Google scientists. On May 4, Baidu posted an article on its technology blog headlined “Baidu Achieves Top Results on Image Recognition Challenge.” The article has since been removed.Zomato’s revenue and operating loss more than tripled last year; Meritnation’s growth slowed to a crawl: Zomato, which recently expanded to allow food orders online and has been aggressively expanding overseas with as many as nine firms in its kitty in the past 12 months alone, saw operating revenue rise over three times from INR 30.6 crore in FY14 to INR 96.7 crore last year. Its operating EBITDA loss in the same period also more than tripled to INR 136 crore from INR 41.39 crore in the year ended March 31, 2014. Operating revenue growth for Meritnation was just 6.5 per cent to INR 21.59 crore. However, the firm managed to restrict its operating losses which declined by a fifth to INR 22.72 crore.Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet, and archived snippets are here. Tech boom lures Indian engineers back home: Kunal Bahl's American dream was coming together in late 2007. He had Ivy League degrees in business and engineering, a debut job at Microsoft Corp. and a roadmap to the career he’d always wanted in Silicon Valley. Then his application for a U.S. visa was rejected and he was kicked out the country. Lucky for him. Back in India, he got over the shock and founded a company in New Delhi with a childhood friend. Today Snapdeal.com is one of the most highly valued startups in the world’s third-largest economy, valued at about $5 billion. The 31-year-old is one of the thousands of a generation of engineers and entrepreneurs who quit America for home — some by choice, some because of U.S. immigration barriers — to find a technology industry with more green-field opportunities than Silicon Valley. Many Indians aren’t leaving at all, or are going to the U.S. for degrees from Harvard and Stanford with no plans to stay after graduation. India's booming startup culture probably wouldn’t feel any affects if the H-1B floodgates suddenly opened. The super-growth potential these days is east, not west. While only about 19 percent of Indians are connected to the Internet, their numbers are mushrooming. Economic output is expanding at an annual rate of more than 7 percent, and by some projections the country's population will reach 1.6 billion to surpass China’s by 2050. India is hard to resist. Google engineering executives Peeyush Ranjan and Punit Soni recently left the company and California for home, moving to Bangalore to join Flipkart, India's largest e-commerce company and Snapdeal’s main domestic rival. Namita Gupta departed Facebook for Zomato, a restaurant-search service based in New Delhi. The trend is a dramatic shift from the 1980s and 1990s, when a graduate education and employment in the U.S. were the brass rings for engineers like Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive officer. Now for anyone interested in programming or e-commerce or mobile-device apps, India \"is like the late 1990s in the U.S.,\" says Bahl. Venture capitalists and hedge funds are swooping in with aims to profit on startups like Snapdeal. Venture financing in Indian tech companies hit $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter, almost six times the $325 million in the year-earlier period, according to CB Insights. Hedge funds, investment firms and asset managers have pumped $3.8 billion into 26 Indian tech startups since the beginning of last year, according to data compiled by Bengaluru-based Tracxn. \"Investors are writing big checks even by Valley standards.\" Russia's Internet Research Agency deploys an army of well-paid “trolls” that seek to wreak havoc all around the Internet - The New York Times investigates. A New York Times report investigates a shadowy organization in St. Petersburg, Russia, that spreads false information on the Internet. It has gone by a few names, but I will refer to it by its best known: the Internet Research Agency. The agency had become known for employing hundreds of Russians to post pro-Kremlin propaganda online under fake identities, including on Twitter, in order to create the illusion of a massive army of supporters; it has often been called a “troll farm.” The word “troll” was popularized in the early 1990s to denounce the people who derailed conversation on Usenet discussion lists with interminable flame wars, or spammed chat rooms with streams of disgusting photos, choking users with a cloud of filth. As the Internet has grown, the problem posed by trolls has grown more salient even as their tactics have remained remarkably constant. Today an ISIS supporter might adopt a pseudonym to harass a critical journalist on Twitter, or a right-wing agitator in the United States might smear demonstrations against police brutality by posing as a thieving, violent protester. Any major conflict is accompanied by a raging online battle between trolls on both sides. As former employees describe it, the Internet Research Agency had industrialized the art of trolling. Management was obsessed with statistics — page views, number of posts, a blog’s place on LiveJournal’s traffic charts — and team leaders compelled hard work through a system of bonuses and fines. “It was a very strong corporate feeling,” Savchuk says. Her schedule gave her two 12-hour days in a row, followed by two days off. Over those two shifts she had to meet a quota of five political posts, 10 nonpolitical posts and 150 to 200 comments on other workers’ posts. The grueling schedule wore her down. She began to feel queasy, she said, posting vitriol about opposition leaders of whom she had no actual opinion, or writing nasty words about Ukrainians when some of her closest acquaintances, including her own ex-husband, were Ukrainian. Russia’s information war might be thought of as the biggest trolling operation in history, and its target is nothing less than the utility of the Internet as a democratic space.Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet on SoundCloud.The Chip Industry Consolidates - In The Third Big Chip Merger of the Year, Intel Agrees to Buy Altera for $16.7 Billion. Recent months have seen a flurry of deals in the semiconductor sector, a business that has become prohibitively expensive for all but the biggest players. On Monday, Intel, the world’s largest maker of chips, said it would pay $16.7 billion for chip company Altera. Last week, Avago Technologies agreed to pay $37 billion for Broadcom. And in March, a company called NXP Semiconductors paid $11.8 billion for Freescale Semiconductor, which began life as part of Motorola and specializes in chips for sensors and cars. “Ten years ago the cost from designing a new chip to making it a product was $10 million to $50 million,” said Mark Hung, an analyst with Gartner. “Today it’s $100 million to $200 million. Solving weird and challenging physics problems at this small size requires a lot of expensive equipment. That’s why there’s all this M.&A.” Besides gaining so-called economies of scale, Intel hopes Altera puts it in better shape for two of the biggest emerging markets, large data centers and the so-called Internet of Things, or computer-enriched machines that work with other devices. Altera’s primary chips help Intel target that market. The San Jose, Calif., company’s chips can be reprogrammed once they leave the foundry, altering some of their functions. Intel’s semiconductors are more powerful, but lack that flexibility. By combining the two types on a single chip, Intel thinks that by late next year it can start offering its big business customers ways of fine-tuning performance to suit specific needs. Also, Intel has fallen behind another big chip company, Qualcomm, in the market for low-powered chips that run mobile devices even as sales of chips for personal computers have slowed. For Intel, improving what it can do in newer, growing sectors is essential. Shares of Altera closed Monday up 5.8 percent. Intel shares were down about 1.6 percent.The history of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) - the long life of a quick fix: Internet protocol  from 1989 leaves data vulnerable to hijackers: “Short-term solutions tend to stay with us for a very long time. And long-term solutions tend to never happen.”  Such is the story of the “three-napkins protocol,” more formally known as Border Gateway Protocol, or BGP. At its most basic level, BGP helps routers decide how to send giant flows of data across the vast mesh of connections that make up the Internet. With infinite numbers of possible paths — some slow and meandering, others quick and direct — BGP gives routers the information they need to pick one, even though there is no overall map of the Internet and no authority charged with directing its traffic. The creation of BGP, which relies on individual networks continuously sharing information about available data links, helped the Internet continue its growth into a worldwide network. But BGP also allows huge swaths of data to be “hijacked” by almost anyone with the necessary skills and access. The main reason is that BGP, like many key systems on the Internet, is built to automatically trust users — something that may work on smaller networks but leaves a global one ripe for attack. Hijackings have become routine events that even experts struggle to explain: What made traffic between two computers in Denver take a 7,000-mile detour through Iceland? How could a single Pakistani company crash YouTube? Why did potentially sensitive Pentagon data once flow through Beijing? To these questions, there are technical answers. But they all boil down to this fact: BGP runs on the honor system, allowing data to get pushed and pulled across the planet in curious ways, at the behest of mysterious masters. In 1989, when BGP was devised, the big issue of the day was the possibility that the Internet might break down. A halt in its furious expansion would have hurt the network’s users and the profits of companies supplying gear and services. Rekhter at the time worked for computing giant IBM; Lougheed was a founding employee of Cisco, maker of networking hardware. “We needed to sell routers. And we had a strong economic motive to make sure this party would continue,” Lougheed said. “When Yakov and I showed up with a solution and it seemed to work, people were quite willing to accept it because they didn’t have anything else.” There were other efforts underway to build routing protocols. BGP won out because it was simple, solved the problem at hand and proved versatile enough to keep data flowing as the Internet doubled in size, again and again and again. Networks across the world embraced the protocol, giving it an edge it has never relinquished. Once technologies are widely deployed, they become almost impossible to replace because many users — including paying customers of technology companies — rely on them and resist buying costly new hardware or software. The result can be a steady buildup of outdated technology, one layer on top of another. It’s as if today’s most important bank vaults sit on foundations of straw and mud.Just Dial’s Q4 revenue up 26%: mulls buy-back of shares: Online local business search engine company Just Dial Ltd reported earnings: Annual operating revenue increased by 28 per cent to Rs 589.80 crore over FY14 for the full year ended March 31, 2015. The firm’s operating income rose 25.8 per cent at Rs 156.28 crore during the quarter against Rs 124.21 crore in Q4 FY14. Founded by Mani in 1994, Just Dial is a local search firm that provides listings of small and medium businesses across the country. Lately it has been expanding its business by adding transaction services for its merchants allowing consumers to buy products and services from third-party vendors like a marketplace. With the most recent addition of products, it has become the first significant listed firm involved in product e-commerce marketplace. Last month, one of the early investors of the company, Tiger Global exited from the firm. Meanwhile, the company said that a meeting of the board of directors will be held on June 4, to consider the proposal to buy-back the fully paid-up equity shares of the firm.Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet. Experimental.Snapchat Said to Be Valued at $16 Billion in New Fundraising: Snapchat raised $537.6 million in a sale of common stock, with the funding round valuing the messaging startup at about $16 billion. The company may raise as much as $650 million in the round, according to a filing Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That would bring Snapchat’s total financing to more than $1.2 billion, according to Crunchbase, as the company builds its business in pursuit of an eventual initial public offering. By raising the latest funding in common stock, Snapchat is bucking convention for later-stage venture deals, which tend to include preferred-stock provisions that allow investors to decrease their risk. “Investing in common stock, especially at a $16 billion valuation, is not normal,” said Anand Sanwal, chief executive officer of venture-capital data firm CB Insights. “It highlights the leverage that Snapchat had in these negotiations because the investors aren’t getting the protections they normally ask for.”Intel is close to clinching a takeover of fellow chip maker Altera for more than $15 billion, the latest sign of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. Intel is expected to pay about $54 a share for Altera, whose specialized chip designs would help Intel expand beyond chips for personal computers. An agreement could be announced as early next week, though sources cautioned that talks are continuing and might still collapse. The two sides had been in talks already this year, though the discussions were eventually delayed when Altera rejected an offer in the ballpark of $54 a share. But after the talks ended, Altera reported quarterly earnings that fell below expectations. Meanwhile, one investor, TIG Advisors, began to publicly campaign for a resumption of talks with Intel. If completed, a takeover would be the latest among chip makers as companies seek larger scale and more diversified offerings. Growing and having more products can give those manufacturers greater savings and negotiating leverage with customers. On Thursday, Avago Technologies struck a roughly $37 billion acquisition of Broadcom to break into the top tier of semiconductor companies. Intel and Altera both make semiconductors, but vastly different types. Intel is known primarily for the standard chips that go into personal computers and computer servers. They consist of millions of transistors, and once created, their performance can be adjusted only slightly by changing the software that works with them. Altera’s chips — known as field programmable gate arrays, or F.P.G.A.s — are lower in power and performance but can be altered after manufacturing to carry out different functions. That gives them far greater flexibility. Intel may be seeking Altera to create computers that combine the power of a standard semiconductor with the flexibility of an F.P.G.A., by means of a board with both types of chip. This could potentially give Intel the ability to build, for example, a computer server that can add functions so it lasts longer inside a corporate data center. This move would reflect several recent trends in the industry. Giant cloud computing centers have become an increasingly large part of Intel’s business, made even more significant as smartphones have lowered the demand for “Intel Inside” personal computers. Intel now has dedicated sales teams working with big chip consumers, like Amazon.com, that tell the company its specific computing needs for its giant cloud systems. In addition, Intel is now concentrating on at least 200 companies that are building significant computing clouds. Adding F.P.G.A.s might be a good way to help companies customize those data centers.Netflix now accounts for almost 37 percent of American Internet traffic: Netflix's share of Internet traffic is exploding. The streaming service now accounts for 36.5 percent of all bandwidth consumed by North American Web users during primetime, according to the Canada-based network firm Sandvine. That's way up from even last November, when Sandvine estimated Netflix's bandwidth footprint at 34.9 percent of Internet traffic. Sandvine's regular reports on Internet usage — based on traffic as it passes through its systems — have become a reliable indicator of which services are taking up the most bandwidth. Both the season five premiere of \"Game of Thrones\" and the most recent \"Call of Duty\" downloadable content led to massive spikes in data consumption, the latest report also finds.Netflix, for better or worse, has become the symbol for net neutrality, which has become a key issue in how regulators analyze proposed cable and telecom mergers. To many in the cable and broadband businesses, the invisible hand of Netflix has been apparent in the failed Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination; in likely restrictions on the merger between AT&T and DirecTV; and in the Obama administration’s embrace of net neutrality, to cite just three prominent examples. A pivotal moment in the net neutrality struggle came last year when Netflix agreed to pay Comcast so-called interconnection fees, a deal that Netflix’s Mr. Hastings last month called a “deal with the devil.” (While Comcast has drawn the brunt of Mr. Hastings’s ire, Netflix also reached similar interconnection deals with every other major Internet service provider.) But securing payment from Netflix for fast and more reliable access may have been a Pyrrhic victory for Comcast and the other the broadband providers. Until then the notion of net neutrality had been something of an abstraction. But when Netflix subscribers found their programs constantly interrupted for “buffering” (an interruption to download more data), the ability of Internet providers to play favorites seemed all too real. Once Netflix started paying fees to Comcast, its customers suddenly found their service improved substantially. Netflix’s experience with Comcast became Exhibit A with the F.C.C. when Netflix opposed the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. “The combined company would possess even more anti-competitive leverage to charge arbitrary interconnection tolls for access to their customers,” Netflix said in a letter to shareholders opposing the merger. It probably didn’t hurt Netflix’s case that just about everyone in Washington watches the hit Netflix series “House of Cards,” and Comcast is the dominant Internet provider there. Tom Wheeler, the F.C.C. chairman, said he, too, had suffered buffering problems, which he called “exasperating.” Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet. ExperimentalGoogle's announcements on Android Pay and Google Wallet pit it squarely against Apple once again: Google lays out its ambitions for your phone, your home, your car and your wallet: Google made clear Thursday that it's still fighting a multifront war against its old rival, Apple -- and that the battles are as heated as ever. Google on Thursday confirmed the arrival of Android Pay and a revamped Google Wallet, an overhaul of the company’s mobile payments products. Both products are a shift from the company’s past mobile commerce efforts, which largely flopped. The new services, like the world of payments in general, are not simple. Here is how they work. Android Pay is essentially a digital payments system that consumers can use to buy things online or in stores from retailers and others who also use the service. It works almost the same way that Apple Pay, Apple’s mobile payments product, functions both in online and offline transactions. To use Android Pay, smartphone users with up-to-date versions of the Android operating system will be able to load Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Discover cards onto their phones. From there, they will be able to wave the phone over the terminals in more than 700,000 stores around the United States to pay for items. Android Pay will also work inside mobile apps from participating developers. Google will use a technology called tokenization to provide merchants with a customer’s payment information without having to hand over their actual credit card number. As with Apple Pay, Google will let customers verify their identity using their fingerprint, a technique which will be built into the next version of Android. Android Pay will also integrate with loyalty programs from a handful of retail partners, which will mean that any points or credits earned at —the point of sale will automatically be added to any loyalty card a customer enters. To date, Apple Pay does not offer this service, an issue that many merchants have asked for privately. Apple plans to discuss its loyalty integration plans at the company’s developer conference next month. Google Wallet, the company’s unsuccessful attempt at a mobile wallet, is not going away. It is just going to serve another purpose. Google Wallet is being reintroduced as a peer-to-peer payments app, which is a way for customers to quickly and easily transfer money to each other’s debit or bank accounts. That once again pits Google against PayPal, which offers its own popular peer-to-peer payments app called Venmo. It also clashes with Square Cash, yet another peer-to-peer payments app offered by Square. Such services have become popular with younger users. Now all Google, Apple and PayPal have to do is persuade consumers that these new payment methods are better than paying the same way they have always done — smartphone-free.Avago to buy Broadcom for $37 billion in biggest-ever chip deal: Avago Technologies agreed on Thursday to buy Broadcom Corp for $37 billion in the largest merger of chipmakers ever, turning a lesser known company run by a ferocious dealmaker into one of the biggest industry players. Avago, which serves the wireless and industrial markets, is offering Broadcom shareholders $17 billion in cash and Avago shares valued at $20 billion. Broadcom is best known for its connectivity chips, which are used widely in smartphones made by Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics. The deal is the biggest so far by Avago Chief Executive Hock Tan, who has developed a small chipmaker into a $36 billion company through acquisitions since taking the helm nine years ago. Tan, a serial deal-maker, has trimmed Avago's portfolio by divesting units while bulking up in faster-growing areas. The combined company, to be based in Singapore and known as Broadcom, will be the third-largest U.S. semiconductor maker by revenue, behind Intel Corp and Qualcomm. The merger is the industry's second megadeal this year and is unlikely to be the last, analysts said. The merger will help the companies improve their bargaining position with manufacturers. Irvine, California-based Broadcom has been struggling to grow as competition in the mobile chip business intensifies. The company's revenue increased by just 1.5 percent last year. The new Broadcom would have annual revenue of $15 billion and an enterprise value of $77 billion, the companies said in a statement. Broadcom shareholders will own about 32 percent of the combined company. They would also have the option to choose between various combinations of cash and stock. Avago, which is incorporated in Singapore and also has headquarters in San Jose, California, said it intended to fund the cash portion of the deal by using funds from the combined company and new debt of $9 billion.Avago's $37 billion deal to buy chipmaker Broadcom Corp may force Qualcomm, the world's largest mobile chip maker to radically rethink its own strategy: Qualcomm, which has dominated the market for connectivity chips on smartphones, has been looking to extend its reach into data centers and network infrastructure, but may find its way blocked by an enlarged competitor combining Avago's strength in storage and Broadcom's power in networking. \"Qualcomm has aspirations of moving into Intel's data center processor incumbency that the Avago storage and now enterprise networking (from Broadcom) capability directly overlays,\" said Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington. That could result in Qualcomm creating some sort of partnership with Intel Corpx he said, to combat the reach of the new company. Wall Street analysts generally cheered the deal on Thursday, despite some fretting about price, saying Broadcom's strength in wireless networking, WiFi and Bluetooth chips is a good complement to Avago's presence in industrial and wired devices. That presents a challenge to Qualcomm, which finds itself in a tough spot in the maturing microprocessor business, as smartphone makers such as Samsung, Apple and Huawei put more effort into producing their own chips. Now a Avago/Broadcom tie-up - which will take the name of Broadcom - potentially gives handset makers another viable supplier, giving them more leverage and putting even more pressure on Qualcomm, said IDC analyst Mario Morales.Here is an audio (MP3) version of this snippet.

Here is her 2015 report, which  calls out that India could be at a tipping point. India's Internet penetration in 2014 was where China was in 2008 and the U.S. was in 1996. If India's curve follows the same pattern, get ready for big things in the next five years. One thing India is lacking is the catalyst companies that will lead its Internet revolution.

The move will allow users of TaxiForSure to go cashless and pay through Paytm’s pre-paid wallet, the company said in a statement. Customers can link their debit card or bank account via a Paytm wallet or recharge their Paytm wallet and use it to pay for their rides. In March, cab hiring startup Ola had acquired TaxiForSure in what largely a stock transaction. Interestingly, Ola also has a prepaid wallet called Ola Money. Last November, on-demand car service Uber, Ola's arch-rival in India's ride-hailing space had joined hands with Paytm.Google and Apple Adjust Their Strategies on Mobile Payments: The battle for mobile software dominance revolves around two companies: Apple and Google. Now both giants are also going head-to-head in mobile payments, as they prepare to push deeper into digital wallets. Google is set to unveil plans at its annual developer conference on Thursday for an overhaul of its mobile payment products. Changes include a service called Android Pay that will let merchants accept credit card payments from inside their mobile apps and can be integrated with loyalty programs at retailers, the people said. Google Wallet, a mobile commerce app, will also be reintroduced as a peer-to-peer payments app that consumers can use to send money to each other directly from their debit accounts, they said. Apple is preparing to announce details about enhancements to Apple Pay at its software conference next month. Those include a rewards program for the mobile wallet service. The moves are the latest advances in mobile payments as several players jockey for an edge. With more consumers willing to make purchases using smartphones, companies are rushing to take the lead in the market, spurring eBay’s PayPal to heavily market a suite of mobile apps, while start-ups like Square and Stripe expand their payments processing software to small and midsize businesses. The stakes are also high for Apple and Google, which are entering mobile payments later than others in the industry. For Apple, mobile payments tie people more directly to its main product, the iPhone. For Google, payments are a hook to reel people into its ecosystem of services and another way to gain insight about consumers. The challenge for Apple and Google, along with rivals, is that the mobile wallet is generally a technology in search of a problem. Cash and credit cards are easy to use and accepted broadly worldwide. As a result, the mobile wallet is typically more of a supplementary service than a replacement. Nonetheless, mobile payments are growing quickly. Forrester Research predicts they will balloon to $142 billion by 2019 in the United States, almost tripling from $52 billion in 2014. Still, Google and Apple offer something that few others can: Hardware, software and an insatiable desire to win. “Google and Apple have deep pockets and the appetite to invest,” said Sucharita Mulpuru of Forrester Research. “They may create something that is a lasting disruption.”An auto-generated audio version on SoundCloud (experimental)Foxconn Unit Seeks the Next Xiaomi in India: For FIH Mobile Ltd., being the unit of Foxconn Technology Group that doesn’t make iPhones has been a challenge. Its former name, Foxconn International Holdings Ltd., was constantly being confused with the parent, while its business model was tied to fading phone labels including Nokia and Sony. So it changed both. Two years later, FIH has a new marquee client in fast-growing smartphone brand Xiaomi Corp. and vastly-improved earnings. In anticipation of shipments climbing 50 percent this year, it’s now looking to India in its hunt for the next big thing after profit doubled in 2014. FIH will assemble its first smartphones in India before the end of this year, prompted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to raise import tariffs, Tong said. The company will have multiple sites in the country, none employing more than 10,000 workers, he said. “We still see the growth rate will be in the emerging market brands,” he said. India could see smartphone sales of 85 million to 100 million this year in a region where emerging Asia-Pacific markets will collectively outpace China over the next four years, Tong said, citing figures from Gartner Inc.Oppo of China to Start Handset Assembly in India for Local Push: Guangdong OPPO Electronics, a Chinese maker of smartphones, will start having its own-brand handsets manufactured in India in August as a saturated home market pushes it to seek growth abroad. Oppo will have its handsets assembled by a partner in the South Asian country, rather than replicate its experience in Indonesia, where it owns a factory, said Vice President Sky Li, who oversees the company’s international mobile business. He declined to identify the partner. “India is the top priority in our expansion in South Asia,” Li said in interview in Beijing on May 20. The company “plans to boost sales volume in the country to a comparable level with China market in five years.” The Chinese phone maker is betting on demand from consumers abroad to drive growth after the domestic market recorded first decline in smartphone shipments in six years in the first quarter, with a year-on-year drop of 4 percent to 98.8 million units, market research company IDC said on May 10. Oppo isn’t alone in seeing India in its future. Xiaomi , the world’s third-largest smartphone maker, released the MI 4i model in the South Asian country last month. Rivals Huawei Technologies and Lenovo Group are also targeting India.Your Instagram photos aren’t really yours: Someone else can sell them for $90,000: This month, painter and photographer Richard Prince reminded us that what you post is public, and given the flexibility of copyright laws, can be shared — and sold — for anyone to see. As a part of the Frieze Art Fair in New York, Prince displayed giant screenshots of other people’s Instagram photos without warning or permission. The collection, “New Portraits,” is primarily made up of pictures of women, many in sexually charged poses. They are not paintings, but screenshots that have been enlarged to 6-foot-tall inkjet prints. According to Vulture, nearly every piece sold for $90,000 each. How is this okay? First you should know that Richard Prince has been “re-photographing” since the 1970s. He takes pictures of photos in magazines, advertisements, books or actors’ headshots, then alters them to varying degrees. Often, they look nearly identical to the originals. This has of course, led to legal trouble. In 2008, French photographer Patrick Cariou sued Prince after he re-photographed Cariou’s images of Jamaica’s Rastafarian community. Although Cariou won at first, on appeal, the court ruled that Prince had not committed copyright infringement because his works were “transformative.” In other words, Prince could make slight adjustments to the photos and call them his own. This is what he did with the Instagram photos. Although he did not alter the usernames or the photos themselves, he removed captions. He then added odd comments on each photo, such as “DVD workshops. Button down. I fit in one leg now. Will it work? Leap of faith” from the account “richardprince1234.”  The account currently has 10,200 followers but not a single picture — perhaps so you can’t steal his images in return? “New Portraits” first debuted last year at Gagosian Gallery on Madison Avenue, the same location where the artist displayed the Rastafarian images he was sued for. Knowing that more legal action is unlikely, Prince appears to be enjoying the attention. He has been re-tweeting and re-posting his many critics.Audio version of this post on SoundCloud (experimental)Smartphone ‘Cold War’ Seen in Asian Moves on Patent Licensing: South Korea and China are adopting antitrust policies that may require companies such as Apple  and Qualcomm  to license inventions to rivals more easily and cheaply, potentially giving Asian companies a leg up against foreign competitors. Brazil and India are considering similar paths. The clampdown on patents has the potential to alter the balance of power in the global mobile-phone industry, which generated $412 billion last year, according to IDC. These new rules may weaken the ability of Apple, Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm -- typically among the top 15 U.S. patent recipients each year -- to compete in China, the world’s largest mobile-phone market, and other countries that follow. “We’re going back to the Cold War and the domino theory,” said Bradley Lui, an antitrust lawyer with Morrison & Foerster in Washington. “The authorities in China see the potential use of patents that might affect companies in China, including state-owned enterprises. It might be an impetus for drawing rules more broadly than we would in the U.S.” Asian regulators were spurred by the smartphone wars, in which tech giants battled over billions of dollars on four continents for more than four years. Foreign governments including Korea and China have been looking more closely at their patent policies, emboldened by debates in Washington over whether patents hinder rather than spur innovation. Qualcomm, which got 63 percent of profit from patents last year, has been investigated on three continents for its licensing practices. It struck a deal with China in February that gives domestic Chinese manufacturers a discount on the royalty charges while fining the company $975 million. Microsoft’s purchase of Nokia Oyj’s handset business has been approved by every country except Korea, which is looking for concessions on some of Nokia patents. In China, Microsoft had to accept lower royalties for patents that read on Google's Android operating system, which runs most of the world’s phones including those made by Chinese manufacturer ZTE. The Redmond, Washington-based company simply excluded Korean assets -- where it didn’t have many sales anyway -- from the Nokia deal.Snapdeal buys mobile commerce platform MartMobi: In a bid to strengthen its mobility platform for merchants, Snapdeal has acquired Hyderabad-based technology startup MartMobi for an undisclosed amount. The MartMobi platform enables e-commerce businesses, brands and retailers to have an instant mobile presence without writing a single line of code. A self-service platform, MartMobi can be used to create custom applications for retailers across all major mobile platforms, thus ensuring a new source of revenue for online ventures. MartMobi was founded in December 2012 by Satya Krishna Ganni (CEO) and Pramod Nair (CTO) – both serial entrepreneurs, who had earlier co-founded LearnSocial, aP2P learning platform that brings together people who want to teach something they are passionate about. Snapdeal has been on an acquisition spree as it seeks to compete with players such as Flipkart and Amazon for a slice of the $3 billion Indian e-commerce industry. In the recent past, Snapdeal has acquired payments and mobile recharge startup FreeCharge in a cash-and-stock deal while picking up stakes in digital financial services platform RupeePower and logistics venture GoJavas.Apple Names Jony Ive ‘Chief Design Officer’: Apple’s Jony Ive, the design genius often credited for Apple’s innovative and unique industrial design language over the past couple of decades, has taken on a new role at the company: Chief Design Officer. The new role elevates him above his previous SVP status, and also installs Richard Howarth as the new head of Industrial Design, and Alan Dye as head of User Interface. Ive’s new role should actually give him more time to actually design, the newly minted C-level executive told the Telegraph. He’s shedding some administrative and management duties to his two new lieutenants, he told the newspaper, and will instead be in charge of both UI and ID, as well as take direct control over retail store design around the world. In a book detailing Ive’s life and work at Apple, Leander Kahney has noted that the British designer has sometimes been uncomfortable with the administrative side of business, and instead prefers to focus on the craft of the actual design process. Ive also notably remains off-stage during Apple’s signature press events, and instead often narrates passionate paeans the company offers during the show in the form of video on the process of designing the products announced by other execs at the events.Baihe, a Chinese dating site where users flaunt their financial standing, bags $241M: Chinese dating site Baihe has announced it recently raised RMB 1.5 billion (US$241 million) in series D funding, according to Sina Tech. The investors have not been disclosed. Baihe approaches dating from an empirical and practical – some might say materialistic – perspective, with the end goal being marriage. Users are required to use their real names and are encouraged to share information like their property status and education. In other words, does this person own a home and have a good degree? Posting videos is also encouraged as they are more difficult to manipulate than photos. Members can verify their marital status to prove they aren’t seeking affairs. Recently, the site added a feature wherein users can post their credit score, as rated by a third-party private agency, to show they are in good financial standing. A member can only see information on other people’s profiles that they have shared themselves.Chinese E-Commerce Giant JD Leads $70M Round In Online Produce Retailer FruitDay: Chinese e-commerce site JD.com is putting its money into fresh fruit and vegetables after it led a $70 million Series C round in FruitDay, a company that sells fresh produce across China. The investment in six-year-old FruitDay, which claims to be China’s largest online produce firm, also included participation from previous backers Susquehanna International Group (SIG) and ClearVue. FruitDay imports over 80 percent of its produce from overseas, and it claimed to be on course to hit 10 million customers before the end of the year — up fourfold from last year. The company said in a statement that it will use the new capital to develop its infrastructure and logistics, hire new management and for general business development. It stands to benefit from more than just JD.com’s money through this alliance, however, since the duo have agreed to “a strategic cooperation” which will allow FruitDay to tap into JD.com’s own logistics and fulfilment network across China to help widen its service in the country. JD.com is commonly thought of as a lesser rival to Alibaba. That’s a pretty hard comparison to shake when you consider that Alibaba was responsible for the largest IPO in U.S. history last year — its current market cap exceeds $230 billion — but JD.com is different in key areas. The company, which is listed on the Nasdaq, and has attracted investment from Alibaba’s fierce rival Tencent, is building out an Amazon-like delivery model which includes its own warehouses — something that Alibaba does not — as this recent New York Times piece points out. Things start to get even more interesting if you pair JD.com’s infrastructure efforts with WeChat, the dominant messaging app in China which is owned by JD.com investor Tencent. JD.com already has a store on WeChat were customers can make purchases without leaving the app, and it could be an interesting medium for fresh fruit and vegetable orders — that’s something Line, another chat app, is pioneering in Southeast Asia right now.Amazon to Stop Funneling European Sales Through Low-Tax Haven: In a move that could put pressure on its rivals to follow suit, Amazon will start paying taxes in a number of European countries where it has large operations, instead of funneling nearly all its sales through Luxembourg, a low-tax haven that is the home base in the region for Amazon and many other large tech companies. Several European countries, including Germany and France, have criticized the tax strategies of some American tech companies, including Google, which use complicated structures that sharply reduce the amount of tax they pay in individual European countries. The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, is also investigating whether Apple and Amazon receive unfair state support through low-tax agreements in Ireland and Luxembourg, respectively, where the companies run their European operations. On May 1, Amazon said that it had started reporting revenue from its operations in Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain. By altering how it reports its revenue, the online retailer may become liable for larger tax charges in certain nations, though it may still be able to reduce its tax burden through other complex accounting practices.Amazon reported a 14 percent rise in European revenue, to 13.6 billion euros, or $15 billion, in 2013 (the latest full-year figures available), according to company filings.The changes to the company’s tax arrangements, however, are likely to put pressure on other tech companies in the United States that funnel the majority of their European revenue through low-tax countries like Ireland and the Netherlands. In Britain, George Osborne, the country’s finance minister, has championed a so-called Google Tax that imposes a 25 percent tax on the local profits of international companies that are perceived to route money unfairly overseas. The new policy came into effect last month. And in response to mounting criticism from other European countries, Ireland announced late last year that it would phase out a tax loophole called the “Double Irish” that would often be used by tech companies. The structure allows corporations with operations in Ireland to make royalty payments for intellectual property to a separate Irish-registered subsidiary. That subsidiary, though incorporated in Ireland, typically has its home in a country that has no corporate income tax. The Double Irish policy has allowed companies like Google to limit how much tax they pay on their international operations. The policy was phased out for new companies at the beginning of 2015, and will be stopped entirely by the end of the decade. Yet, despite the growing clampdown on tax structures used by American tech companies and others, analysts say that European countries are still vying to attract international companies through low-tax policies. Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands have already created new policies that allow companies to apply for a lower tax rate on profits that result from certain patents that are held locally. The European Commission, however, is currently reviewing the legality of these so-called patent boxes.Contest for Nokia's maps business heats up; German carmakers, Uber and Baidu, and Tencent are all in the fray: The contest for Nokia's maps business has become a three-way race between German carmakers, a consortium including Uber and Baidu, and a third group including China's Tencent and Navinfo, people familiar with the process said. Finland's Nokia has started an auction of its maps business HERE while it completes its 15.6 billion euros ($17.2 billion) takeover of network equipment maker Alcatel Lucent. German automakers Daimler , BMW and Volkswagen's premium brand Audi have teamed up with private equity firm General Atlantic to form what is being described as the \"Industry consortium\", two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. Nokia, Daimler, BMW and General Atlantic declined to comment. The automakers have agreed to contribute potentially more than 700 million euros, but below 1 billion euros, said one auto industry source, who declined to be named. The consortium could be widened to include more carmakers, the source added. Another group consists of Chinese media, mobile and Internet services firm Tencent Holdings, Chinese map maker Navinfo, and Swedish buyout firm EQT Partners, three sources who declined to be named said. Navinfo and Tencent were not immediately available for comment. EQT declined to comment. Private equity firm Apax has joined U.S.-based taxi service Uber and China's Baidu in a third consortium, a financial source who declined to be named said. Apax and Uber declined to comment. Baidu was not immediately available for comment. Analysts put the potential value of HERE at 2 billion euros to 4 billion euros.Chinese Car-Hailing App, Backed by Both Alibaba and Tencent, Gives Away Free Rides to Fend Off Uber: Chinese car-hailing app operator Didi Kuaidi will give away 1 billion yuan ($161 million) worth of rides to commuters starting next week to promote its new chauffeur service. The company, backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., is expanding into the market for ride-sharing and carpooling after winning an estimated 99 percent of the taxi-hailing market share. The giveaway is expected to hit Uber Technologies Inc. and Yidao Yongche, two other companies competing for the estimated $1 trillion-a-year market for transportation services in the world’s most populous country. China’s car-hailing industry is currently dominated by Didi and Kuaidi, which together account for a combined 78 percent of ride bookings, with Uber a distant third at 11 percent, according to Analysys International, an industry researcher. “Three years from now, our goal is to allow everyone to hail a taxi or get a ride within three minutes and to serve 30 million people per day,” Cheng Wei, chief executive officer of Didi Kuaidi, said in a statement. The company hopes to meet the demand by supplying more cars in a more flexible way, he said in the statement. Starting May 25, commuters in 12 Chinese cities will enjoy free rides for Didi Kuaidi’s chauffeur service every Monday for a month, according to the company. Didi Kuaidi aims to create the largest “one-stop transportation platform” in the world, the company said. The goal is to cover commuting needs from hailing taxis through mobile apps, to carpooling and booking premium cars with chauffeurs, it said. Formed out of an alliance of two competing apps, the two former rivals had engaged in intense competition, giving out subsidies to drivers and riders, before agreeing to work together in February. Alibaba and Tencent own 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively, in the merged company. Didi Kuaidi won a breakthrough this month after Shanghai said it will include the company in a new taxi-booking platform, the first official recognition of mobile-booking apps. The company is in talks with more local governments about cooperating on car-hailing services, Cheng said, declining to name the cities. By contrast, local media reported Uber’s offices in Guangzhou in southern China were raided by local authorities.EBay Plots European Growth With Click-and-Collect Expansion; Surplus Space at Supermarkets Adds to Opportunity:  EBay Inc. plans to expand its click-and-collect service in the U.K. and across Europe, after buyers on its site collected 1.5 million parcels from British store chain Argos in the first 18 months of the service. Click and collect is becoming “the dominant way that consumers want their online purchases to be fulfilled” in the U.K., EBay’s senior vice president for Europe Paul Todd said in an interview at Bloomberg’s London headquarters. EBay, based in San Jose, California, is looking at all kinds of partnerships to boost its presence, Todd said. The Argos service, covering about 750 stores across Britain, is used by about 160,000 EBay merchants. Click-and-collect services are booming in Europe as more shoppers choose to fetch their purchase from a store rather than risk missing a home delivery. More than half of online orders placed with John Lewis department stores in the U.K. last Christmas were picked up from a store. France’s Darty Plc said Thursday that 20 percent of all Web sales in the fourth quarter were collected, up from about 10 percent a year ago. Surplus space in U.K. supermarkets may be one avenue that the company explores to boost its collection capabilities. J Sainsbury Plc said this month that about a quarter of its stores will have some under-utilized space in the next five years. The need for grocers to fill that space presents a “huge opportunity” for EBay, Todd said.Consolidation in China's online travel sector: Expedia gives up on China partner, sells off $671M majority stake in eLong: Ctrip, China’s top travel site, this afternoon announced it has taken a US$400 million stake in long-time arch-rival eLong. The deal, which closed today, was done by acquiring eLong shares from Expedia. Ctrip now has a 37.6 percent stake in its erstwhile rival. Expedia has sold off its entire 62.4 percent stake in eLong, worth US$671 million, by selling the remaining shares to three other buyers (Keystone Lodging Holdings, Plateno Group, and Luxuriant Holdings), the US-based company said today. As a result of this deal, Ctrip says that it and Expedia have agreed to cooperate with each other on “certain travel product offerings for specified geographic markets.” Expedia’s brief statement did not make clear why it’s exiting eLong. The huge Expedia sell-off marks a major sea-change in China’s highly competitive travel ecommerce sector. It seems to be a huge win for Ctrip, which has now tamed its closest competitor. That leaves Ctrip freer to focus on newer and fast-growing rivals such as Baidu-owned Qunar, Tuniu, and LY. Ctrip has US backing of its own in the form of Priceline, which owns about eight percent of the company.HP sells $2.3 billion China unit stake to forge partnership with elite Chinese university-linked group: Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) will sell a controlling 51 percent stake in its China-based data-networking business to China's Tsinghua Unigroup for at least $2.3 billion, forming a partnership designed to create a Chinese technology powerhouse. State-backed Tsinghua Holdings' subsidiary Unisplendour Corp Ltd 000938.SZ will acquire 51 percent of HP's H3C Technologies for at least $2.3 billion, Unisplendour said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange late on Thursday. The U.S. company also said in a statement on Thursday it will form a partnership with Tsinghua Holdings, affiliated with China's elite Tsinghua University, to create a group in China to house H3C's networking operation alongside its China-based server, data-storage and technology-services businesses.Report/Rumor: CommonFloor and Quikr in preliminary talks which may lead to a merger: After recent mergers in India’s e-commerce and taxi businesses, it appears that online real estate is set to see a winnowing of weaker players. Bengaluru-based Maxheap Technologies Pvt Ltd, which owns online real estate portal CommonFloor, is believed to be in preliminary conversations with classifieds company Quikr about teaming up, according to three people familiar with the developing situation.PayPal’s Instant Checkout “One Touch” Aims to Boost Conversion Rates on Mobile, No Longer Requires PayPal’s App: PayPal’s instant checkout service called OneTouch is now being extended to support all merchants using the e-commerce platform Bigcommerce, as well as on mobile devices – even in cases where the consumer doesn’t have the PayPal native application installed. The service, which allows customers to check out from an online merchant without having to enter their username and password, launched publicly last fall on mobile devices then expanded to the web in April. One Touch was originally designed to improve the conversion rates for online transactions. On mobile in particular, consumers tend to abandon purchases simply because of the challenges associated with entering in their personal information payment card details on mobile’s small screen. PayPal’s move to counter this trend was OneTouch for Mobile, which allows a customer’s information to be stored and shared between supported apps. That means that customers would only have to enter their PayPal credentials for their first mobile purchase, but subsequent purchases could be made with just one tap. The system is currently being used by a number of merchants including Jane.com, ParkWhiz, StubHub, Threadless, Airbnb, Lyft and Munchery, for example. In April, PayPal announced that it would offer similar functionality to web-based merchants as well, which meant the product now had the potential to reach PayPal’s 165 million customers. Despite being an older player in the ever-changing payments industry where newer contenders including Stripe, and now Apple Pay, are finding their ways into mobile apps and online stores, PayPal’s payments business is still growing. The company reported its net total payment volume rose 18 percent to $61 billion, it said in April, and it added 3.6 million new accounts in the quarter. The company says that today, online and mobile shopping accounts for $2.5 trillion in annual retail sales, and PayPal processes nearly 12.5 million payments for its customers daily. The move towards digital payments over physical payments is also a factor in PayPal’s growth. It notes that a couple of years ago, half of transactions involved checks or cash, but in a couple years’ time, they’ll account for only 25 percent of transactions.New patent lawsuits are down for the first time in five years on tighter patent processes. For months, Congress has moved steadily toward a bill that targets patent trolls — companies that own patents but don't make any products with them. The problem, critics say, is that the patent holders will sue innocent companies in hopes they'll simply settle for a bunch of cash. But even as firms like Etsy and Kickstarter hit Capitol Hill this week to press the case against abusive patent lawsuits, a new study shows that the pace of litigation has actually slipped — for the first time in five years. This is a big deal for a whole range of industries, not just the tech sector. It's happening at a time when the spotlight on frivolous patent lawsuits has never been brighter. And that makes it a surprising find. You can see that in 2014, there was a sharp drop in the number of new patent cases. There were about 5,700 filed last year, according to PwC. That might sound like a lot, but it's actually a 13 percent drop from the year before. We haven't seen anything like this since 2009 — which is about when many companies started getting hit with their first demand letters. The letters are often vague about which patents have allegedly been infringed, leading to confusion and fear among the victims about what they may have done wrong. They can fight the suit and go to court, but defending a case is costly and unaffordable for many companies. The congressional legislation being debated would try to address some of these issues. But here's what else could wind up curtailing patent litigation: The Supreme Court. According to PwC, the sharp decline in new patent lawsuits can be traced almost directly to the outcome of a major case last year known as Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank. Most analysts at the time said that Alice didn't matter much. The Court ruled that the software patent Alice Corp. used to sue CLS didn't pass the smell test. That much was obvious to many people watching the case; what they really wanted from the Court decision was a more concrete outline as to what kinds of software patent were patentable. But the fact that Alice put some limits on software patents at all appears to have put major pressure on those who are considering bringing a patent lawsuit, said PwC.Alice effectively \"raised the bar for patentability and enforcement of software patents,\" PwC's report reads.API-for-payments Startup Stripe In Talks For Up To $500 Million In New Funding That Could Value the Firm at $5B: Stripe is raising a new round of funding, according to sources with knowledge of the talks. One source with direct knowledge of the talks tells us that one of the leading investors in the deal is Yuri Milner’s DST Global. While all sources maintained that the round was “big,” there wasn’t a consensus on how much Stripe is looking to raise. The aforementioned source said that the round could be as big as $500 million and another source said the financing round would raise Stripe’s valuation to $5 billion. A Stripe spokesperson declined to comment on rumors and speculation. Stripe has seen rapid growth and is known for being very developer-friendly, having impeccable customer service, and being easy to implement. Processing payments can be quite a headache for young startups, and Stripe tries to make the process as easy as possible so that they can focus on what’s important: building a company. So far, the company has raised $190 million from some high-profile investors, including PayPal cofounders Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, Box CEO Aaron Levie, Khosla Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital. Stripe has been adding products and high-profile partners over the past year as it expands across the globe. Earlier this week, Stripe announced a private beta program for Japan, and there are rumors that the company is looking to move to Singapore as well. It also added a new product called Stripe Connect to help marketplace companies — like Lyft, which needs to accept payments from customers and send payments to drivers —and partnered with Twitter and Facebook to power the respective companies Buy buttons. Stripe also inked a deal to support AliPay, which might be coming to the US soon. The fundraising round could be used to further spur global expansion. Milner has invested in social media giants Facebook and Twitter, and more recently turned his focus to international e-commerce and marketplace companies, like FlipKart and Ola Cabs. International expansion costs money — Stripe currently operates in 20 countries, while competitors like Braintree support worldwide coverage. That being said, Stripe will be facing some increased competition from an independent PayPal when the latter spins off from parent company eBay sometime during the Q3 of this year. PayPal acquired payment processor Braintree in 2013 for $800 million, which has some big clients, like Uber and Hotel Tonight, and launched v.zero, a new payment API to help developers. Smaller competitors are itching to go abroad as well — WePay raised $40 million to expand marketplace payment processing across the globe.Canadian eCommerce software maker Shopify valued at $1.27 billion at IPO price: Canadian e-commerce software maker Shopify Inc said its U.S. initial public offering was priced at $17 per share, valuing the company at about $1.27 billion. The company's IPO of 7.7 million class A subordinate shares raised about $131 million, after it was priced above the top end of the expected range of $14-$16. The offering was earlier expected to be priced at $12-$14. The company sold all the shares in the offering. \"Pricing reflects big enthusiasm for these type of deals. It's a unique company in a hot area with lots of growth,\" said Josef Schuster, founder of IPO investment firm IPOX Schuster LLC. \"There's going to be a big pop coming tomorrow.\" Ottawa-based Shopify, which is also expected to debut on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday, makes software that helps small and medium-sized retailers to set up online storefronts. Shopify charges a monthly subscription fees of $29-$179. The company has also created online stores for a variety of retailers ranging from tattoo companies to fashion boutiques and vintage book sellers. Shopify said 162,261 merchants had subscribed to its platform from about 150 countries as of March 31. Shopify's biggest investors are venture capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners, with a 30 percent stake, and FirstMark Capital LP, which has a nearly 12 percent stake.Yahoo shares fall as Marissa Mayer’s plan to spin off Yahoo’s $34 billion stake in Alibaba tax-free could run into resistance from federal tax authorities. An official from the Internal Revenue Service told tax lawyers in Washington on Tuesday that the agency was weighing potential changes to how it treats some kinds of tax-free spinoffs. The I.R.S. is particularly concerned about spinoffs in which the operating business comprises only a small portion of the new publicly traded company, according to the official. That is exactly the type of spinoff that Ms. Mayer, chief executive of Yahoo, proposed in January. The Internet company intends to bundle its small-business services division with its 384 million shares of Alibaba into a new company and spin it off to Yahoo shareholders later this year. As reports of the I.R.S. review circulated on Tuesday in the last half-hour of trading, Yahoo shares plunged, closing at $40.98, down 7.6 percent. More than half of the company’s stock market valuation is based on its stake in Alibaba. Robert Peck, an Internet stock analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said it was unclear whether any change in the government’s tax treatment of spinoffs would affect transactions already in the works, such as the Yahoo-Alibaba transaction. “It’s very ambiguous,” he said. “Does it apply to current deals they are looking at, or future deals only?” If Yahoo’s disposal of Alibaba were fully taxed, Mr. Peck estimated that the fair value for Yahoo’s stock would be about $40 a share, or roughly the current level. If the spinoff remains tax-free as Yahoo envisioned it, then Yahoo shares are worth closer to $55, he said. Currently, a spinoff must include an operating business, not just assets like stock, to qualify as a tax-free transaction. The I.R.S. has not established firm guidelines about how important the operating business must be to the spinoff company. Yahoo Small Business, the operating unit that Yahoo is proposing to include with the Alibaba stake, is a strong business that never fit well with the rest of Yahoo’s portfolio, according to Amit Kumar, who ran the unit until last November. “The profitability and revenue profile were surprisingly strong, compared to many other businesses at Yahoo,” he said. “But certainly by the fact that Yahoo chose Yahoo Small Business as the division to spin off, they don’t consider it a core business.”No, Uber drivers can’t game the ‘surge pricing’ system as easily the way one driver claims: Uber's \"surge pricing\" algorithm is both critical to its success and a huge proverbial target on the company's back. It is, Uber says, supply and demand in its most basic form: When drivers are scarce, and demand is high, prices go up. That's good for drivers who are now being paid less on the Uber base rate since the company began dropping prices to beat the competition and generate demand. And it can be good for those who are desperate for a ride — and are willing to pay. Critics say that surge pricing can result in truly absurd fares at peak times, and the company admitted making a misstep by allowing surge pricing to go into effect in the middle a natural disaster. Recently, a video, purportedly from an Uber driver, was published online claiming to show a strategy that Uber drivers can use to manipulate the system by inducing higher and higher surge fares. There's no narration of what's happening, but over the course of about three minutes, the \"driver\" demonstrates how to do this by accepting rides, then immediately canceling them. The person does this several times, and by the end of the video, surge pricing increases to 2.1 times the normal fare in some areas.  The video, titled \"Driving for surge,\" was initially posted publicly in April but has now been made private. The video was also posted in a thread on a message board for ride-share drivers last week by a user who was labeled on the message board as a \"well-known member.\" That person encouraged drivers to get \"on the surge bus\" and ride \"to profits together.\" The person who shared the video on the ride-sharing forum claimed that he has been \"doing this for months\" without hearing anything from Uber. It is unclear whether that is true, and Uber would not comment on the individual driver, who included his first name and license plate number in the video. Even if the strategy was plausible, it probably won't work for long, as other drivers on the forum quickly pointed out. \"This is a terrible strategy. You'll get deactivated within a week with that many trip cancellations,\" one driver commented. Surge pricing in an entire city, where there might be hundreds or thousands of drivers on the road, is unlikely to be affected by the actions of a single driver — or even a handful of drivers. Surge pricing kicks in when a lot of different users begin requesting rides and there aren't enough drivers. Sure-fire predictors for surge pricing: bad weather, rush hour or, perhaps, the time just before Sunday brunch. Because Uber monitors every ride, repeatedly canceling rides is really just a good way for a driver to trigger enhanced scrutiny.People Changes at Tiger Global. Tiger Global Management on Monday announced key personnel changes including the departure of Feroz Dewan, who has run the closely watched Wall Street firm's hedge fund operations and is leaving to start his own business. Dewan, a partner who has been with Tiger Global for 12 years, will leave at the end of June, the firm's founder, Chase Coleman, wrote to clients in a letter seen by Reuters. Tiger Global oversees roughly $20 billion in assets, with roughly half invested in its fast-growing private equity business. The remainder is invested in public equities with about $6 billion in its hedge fund and $3.5 billion in its long-only portfolios. Scott Shleifer, who had been running the private equity business with Lee Fixel, will take over as head of the firm's public equity business. Tiger Global has long been focused on technology investing and listed Chinese e-commerce company JD.com Inc as its biggest holding at the end of the first quarter. It also raised its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Co , which listed its shares in the biggest ever initial public offering last year, a regulatory filing shows. The hedge fund started the year on a rocky note but recovered some ground in April with a 3.2 percent gain, leaving it down 2.4 percent for the year to date, an investor said. Separately, Caleb Watts, also a Tiger Global partner, also will be leaving to focus on managing his own money, according to the letter. To streamline operations the firm is also merging its Tiger Global Internet Opportunities Fund into its Tiger Global Long Opportunities fund.Alibaba-backed Visualead rolls out new dotless QR codes that aim to reduce counterfeiting. In January, Alibaba disclosed its investment in Visualead, an Israeli startup that helps brands make colorful, visually appealing QR codes. While the company’s product was cute, its value to Alibaba is growing clearer now that it has revealed a new QR code alternative that aims to prevent counterfeit sales. Alibaba is using Visualead’s technology to power Blue Star, a new tool that prints out individual, scannable codes for individual packages. When scanned using the mobile app for Taobao, an image appears confirming (or denying) the product’s authenticity. Brands can choose from a set number of templates to customize these landing images and throw in links to promotions or e-commerce pages… perhaps even ones that are on an Alibaba property. Visualead co-founder and CEO Nevo Alva tells Tech in Asia that Alibaba only opens Blue Star to genuine brands. That means Nike can sign up, but FakeNikes.com will get turned away. Alva also adds that Alibaba is providing Blue Star free-of-charge for the time being, irrespective of where the goods will be sold. That means that Nike can pin the codes to packages that will go to an Alibaba competitor.Spotify Inks Deal With Starbucks Tasking Customers With Picking In-Store Music. Spotify and Starbucks just announced a clever deal to promote Spotify Premium while giving Starbuck customers and employees the opportunity to influence the music played at their local Starbucks. This is the latest in a line of high-profile deals Spotify bagged that puts its brand in front of an important consumer demographic. Soon baristas will be tasked with making coffee and picking the music in their locations. The deal links Starbucks’ loyalty program with Spotify’s massive music ecosystem, giving My Starbucks Reward members unique access to Spotify. Program users will then be able to influence which songs makes it on in-store playlists. The program starts with 150,000 U.S.-based Starbucks store employees who will receive a Spotify Premium membership in the fall. The plan is then to roll out the service to Starbucks customers shortly after. Streaming music companies such as Spotify, Rdio and others are racing to differentiate themselves. Since most platforms offer similar music and experiences, the war is mostly in public relations. And Spotify is winning this part of the war signing deals to allow Uber riders to DJ from the backseat and getting the streaming service into BMW and Mini cars. Starbucks has long associated itself with emerging music and this deal with Spotify pushes the coffee retailer (along with its legions of dedicated customers) into the age of streaming media.Singapore’s Postal Service Reinvents for the Digital Age, Derives a Quarter of its Revenue from eCommerce: With traditional mail services in decline, post offices around the world are scrambling to reinvent themselves for the digital age. “Sitting on that burning platform, we looked around and said, ‘Where could we develop?’” said Wolfgang Baier, the chief executive of SingPost. Japan Post is buying the largest private package and freight delivery company in Australia, Toll Holdings, in a bid to create a rival to UPS and FedEx. The United States Postal Service, which lost $5.5 billion last year, is providing Sunday deliveries for Amazon. Australia Post is working with the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba to help local businesses connect with consumers in China. There are at least two business trends unfolding before us. One is the death of mail,” said Frank Lavin, chief executive of the e-commerce consultancy Export Now. “The second is this boom in e-commerce.” SingPost’s makeover is among the most ambitious. Besides its regular postal duties, it offers a basket of services for companies, including website development, online marketing, customer service and, of course, package delivery. Following the Amazon model, it is building a network of 24 warehouses in 12 countries to stockpile goods for companies. The e-commerce team is staffed with former Silicon Valley executives. Singapore’s central location, said Mr. Baier, makes it a natural hub for e-commerce in Asia. He recited numbers to demonstrate the scale of the opportunity: Over 600 million consumers live in the region around Singapore, and 2.2 billion people are within a five-hour flight. The shift has been stark for the postal service, once a state-owned company that went public in 2003. Four years ago, e-commerce barely figured into its bottom line. Today, it accounts for more than a quarter of the group’s revenues, which have grown by 60 percent during that same period. Others are taking notice. Last year, Alibaba paid $250 million for a 10 percent stake in SingPost. Alibaba and SingPost are now in discussions to form a joint venture focused on e-commerce logistics in Southeast Asia. Then, two years ago, SingPost made its biggest digital push, creating SP eCommerce to tap into the Internet retail boom in Asia. Today, it counts nearly 1,000 companies as clients, including Philips, Uniqlo, Deckers and Muji. SP eCommerce’s offices feel more start-up than mailroom. There is a Foosball table in one corner. Employees can play Ping-Pong. The group’s chief executive, Marcelo Wesseler, created his first e-commerce website in 1997 and worked in Silicon Valley before moving to Singapore. Other employees have come from technology stalwarts like Amazon and Hewlett-Packard. The company also created a customer-care department. At its Singapore offices, 30 or so employees handle the phones, answering questions or addressing complaints. An additional 200 customer-service agents work elsewhere. As part of the e-commerce expansion, SingPost upgraded its core delivery services. It has bolstered its network of warehouses and fulfillment centers, most of which are in Asia. The centers handle freight and customs clearance so goods can move faster through the region, where regulations differ from country to country. In Singapore, SingPost has invested $182 million in building a high-tech warehouse that will merge logistics and sorting into one assembly line. Workers punch or scan an order on a screen, and robotic trays deliver products from shelves for them to pack and ship. SingPost is pitching itself as a conduit to the Asian consumer, particularly in countries like Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. With its swelling population of young and mobile consumers with newly disposable incomes, the region offers a rich seam of new opportunities. Looking beyond its borders for growth, the Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi last year opened a regional headquarters in Singapore, using it as a launching pad to move into Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia. Next, it is targeting Vietnam and Thailand. It teamed up with SingPost for support on logistics for e-commerce, which accounts for 80 percent of Xiaomi’s sales in Southeast Asia. At its campus in Singapore, SingPost built a warehouse specially for Xiaomi, where orders from the first click to the final delivery are handled. Inside the 11,000-square-foot space, a smartphone battery is stuffed into a cardboard box, sent flying down a green conveyor belt and zipped off to the customer a few miles away. A video camera is perched above, controlled by someone who watches from Beijing.Alibaba sued in U.S. by luxury brands over counterfeit goods: A group of luxury goods makers sued Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) on Friday, contending the Chinese online shopping giant had knowingly made it possible for counterfeiters to sell their products throughout the world. The lawsuit was filed in Manhattan federal court by Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and other brands owned by Paris-based Kering seeking damages and an injunction for alleged violations of trademark and racketeering laws. The lawsuit alleged that Alibaba had conspired to manufacture, offer for sale and traffic in counterfeit products bearing their trademarks without their permission. Friday's lawsuit marked the second time in less than a year that the Kering brands had sued Alibaba over the alleged sale of counterfeit products. An earlier lawsuit was filed in July only to be withdrawn the same month with the ability to refile it while the Kering units worked toward a resolution with Alibaba, according to court records. The lawsuit alleged that Alibaba and its related entities \"provide the marketplace advertising and other essential services necessary for counterfeiters to sell their counterfeit products to customers in the United States.\" The lawsuit cited, for example, an alleged fake Gucci bag offered for $2 to $5 each by a Chinese merchant to buyers seeking at least 2,000 units. The authentic Gucci bag retails for $795, the complaint said. Alibaba has allowed for counterfeit sales to continue even when it had been expressly informed that merchants were selling fake products, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit seeks a court order that, among other things, would block Alibaba from offering or facilitating the sale of counterfeit products and unspecified damages that could include $2 per counterfeit item under a statutory regime.Netflix Shares at All-Time High, Said to be in Talks to Enter China in partnership with Alibaba investee Wasu: Netflix Inc. rose above $600 a share for the first time after it was reported to be in talks with a Chinese media company backed by Jack Ma and other possible partners as it seeks entry into China’s $5.9 billion online video market. Netflix has held discussions with companies including Wasu Media Holding Co., according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks are private. Netflix plans “to be nearly global by the end of 2016,” Anne Marie Squeo, a spokeswoman, said in response to questions about a possible China partnership. Shares of Netflix, based in Los Gatos, California, climbed 4.5 percent to close at $613.25 in New York. A local partnership would be essential given the Chinese government’s strict controls over licensing for online content. Netflix wants a partner that has licenses for content on all devices -- including mobile phones, computers and set-top boxes, according to the people. China’s State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television has given Internet TV licenses to seven companies, including Wasu. Netflix would need to sort out content censorship regulations with Chinese authorities. Starting this April, new episodes of foreign programs -- including “Mad Men” and “The Simpsons” -- can’t be shown until after the shows’ seasons have ended, according to a government notice. Episodes need to handed in to censors for approval, and content deemed violent, sexual or offensive to the ruling Communist Party can be cut, according to notices. Wasu, one of the first companies in China to receive an Internet TV license from the government, has been working with Ma’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to produce set-top boxes since 2013. Wasu operates cable TV and broadband networks in Hangzhou, where Alibaba is based. Wasu said in April last year it would sell a 20 percent stake to Alibaba Chairman Ma and fellow billionaire Shi Yuzhu.Lyft raises $150M at valuation of $2.5B; Carl Icahn invests $100M: Lyft Inc. raised an additional $150 million, led by an investment of $100 million from billionaire Carl Icahn, raising the stakes in the car-hailing service’s rivalry with Uber Technologies Inc. The fundraising will help Lyft in a battle for market share with the much larger Uber. A Lyft presentation to investors that was obtained by Bloomberg News in April showed mounting costs for marketing the service. Lyft projects a 512 percent jump in net revenue this year to $796 million. Lyft’s other investors include Japan’s Rakuten, China’s Alibaba and the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The San Francisco-based company had a fourfold increase in active passengers on 2.2 million rides in December 2014 but growth was beginning to slow, the presentation for investors said. The document was prepared for a $530 million fundraising round announced in March that valued the company at about $2.5 billion.Taiwan orders Alibaba's Taobao out for rule violation: Taiwan has ordered Alibaba's online marketplace Taobao to withdraw from the island within six months for violating investment rules required for a Chinese company, Chinese and Taiwanese media said on Thursday. Taobao has been fined T$240,000 ($7,860) and must withdraw or transfer its holdings from its operation in Taiwan, China's Xinhua news agency and Taiwan's Economic Daily News quoted the island's investment commission as saying. Taobao and the commission could not immediately be reached for comment. The commission falls under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and has authority to regulate Chinese investments in Taiwan. In March, Alibaba's B2B platform Alibaba.com was ordered to leave the island within six months and fined T$120,000 for a similar reason. Chinese investments in Taiwan are regulated strictly because Taiwan considers mainland China a political rival, even though trade and economic ties have expanded markedly since the late 2000s.A Look at the Business Model of Kijiji, a Flop in the US, but which Rules Online Classifieds in Canada: More than 12 million people visit Kijiji’s site in Canada every month, three times the amount drawn to Craigslist in the country. The service is used by 42 percent of Canadians, according to comScore, making it one of country’s 10 most popular sites. It has also eclipsed other companies’ online businesses, including Cox Automotive’s once dominant used-car site, AutoTrader. That success is a striking counterexample to the globalization of the web, in which services like Facebook and Google offer a single product worldwide. It also represents one of the few online brands that fizzled in the United States but found success elsewhere, as the social media pioneer Friendster has in the Philippines and Malaysia. Four years earlier, Ms. Bannister joined eBay in California and became director of category development, working to expand the online auction site beyond its original niche of collectible trinkets. When she returned to Canada, as director of product, she was put in charge of the features in the Canadian version of eBay. She soon found that the operation had a significant problem. “EBay Canada was doing a very good job of getting people in Canada to the website, but we were doing a terrible job actually getting them to transact on the website,” said Ms. Bannister, who is now a general partner at Real Ventures, a seed capital investment fund. “We did some things on the website to try to address it, but it didn’t really close the gap.” A fundamental problem for eBay in Canada, Mr. Shiau said, is that Canadians generally do not like auction-based pricing. On top of that, Ms. Bannister found that because Canada’s vast geography and low population density make shipping costs high and delivery times long, buyers of secondhand goods preferred to make deals in person. To Ms. Bannister, the answer for eBay seemed to be online classified ads. At the head office, however, the idea did not appear to be quite so obvious. At the time, about 10 percent of Canadians used Craigslist, a level many eBay executives thought meant that it was fully entrenched. Nevertheless, they gave Ms. Bannister some classifieds site software being developed for Europe along with a small amount of money to adapt the site and market the result. Listings swiftly grew. Making money, however, was a more gradual process. Among other things, the site did not even introduce banner advertising until it had become fully established. Today, Kijiji has three revenue sources. In addition to banner ads, the site sells more prominent positions within results and more elaborate displays for ads like photo galleries. Also, car dealers and housing rental companies pay subscription fees for their listings. Despite those fees, the autos section is hugely popular, with 4.6 million vehicles listed last year, said Scott Neil, managing director of Kijiji in Canada. This month, Kijiji attracted about 160 car dealers to an annual sales conference in Toronto. And in one measure of Kijiji’s success, Postmedia Network, the dominant newspaper publisher in most large Canadian cities, now uses the service to provide the used-car listings on its automotive websites.Alibaba to invest more abroad as globalization top priority: CEO Zhang Alibaba Group Holding Ltd will invest heavily in existing and new ventures abroad, making its push beyond the China market a top priority, the Chinese e-commerce leader's new CEO, Daniel Zhang, said. Zhang's comments come at a time when Alibaba aims to maintain its rapid growth even as the prospect of e-commerce saturation at home looms over the company. \"We must absolutely globalize,\" Zhang said in his first speech since taking up his new post this week, according to a report on Thursday on Alibaba's news and commentary website, Alizila. The vast bulk of Alibaba's revenue comes from its dominant domestic online marketplaces, but the company has been investing in a range of sectors abroad. Just this week it announced it would set up a cloud computing base in Dubai, and boosted its stake in U.S. e-retailer Zulily Inc. Zhang said if Alibaba does not globalize it won't be able to last 100 years - a goal set out by Executive Chairman Jack Ma. In the three months ended March, Alibaba's revenue from China commerce grew 39 percent to $2.2 billion. International commerce grew 27 percent to $264 million and only accounted for 9 percent of revenue, compared to 11 percent in the same period a year earlier. Alibaba says some of its larger overseas markets include Brazil and Russia. The company and its affiliates are also making overtures in India, where it is in talks with phone maker Micromax Informatics to buy a $1.2 billion stake, according to several people with direct knowledge of the matter.PayPal to Trade Under Old Symbol PYPL After Split From EBay: PayPal, the payments division that’s separating from EBay Inc., will trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market as PYPL, its original ticker symbol before being acquired by the online marketplace in 2002. EBay announced the split last year after activist investor Carl Icahn said PayPal was being held back by its parent company’s slower-growing Web marketplace business. All of EBay Inc.’s 15 board members will remain with the company or become new board members of PayPal when it spins off from EBay in the third quarter. EBay Chairman Pierre Omidyar, who founded the online marketplace in 1995, will be a director for both companies, EBay said Thursday in a statement.Deal Talks for 'Here' Mapping Service Brings Spotlight to the Lucrative B2B Location Data Market: When people look up a company’s Facebook page on their smartphones, the address is overlaid on a digital map provided by Here, Nokia’s mapping unit, which is for sale. The same goes for the mapping services offered by Amazon and Yahoo. The tech giants are just three of the many companies, including SAP, Verizon Wireless and Baidu, the Chinese search engine,​ that rely heavily on Nokia’s geospatial data. Companies are grappling to stay relevant in a world where smartphones — and people’s geographical information — are at the heart of nearly every tech leader’s plans. That is why companies like Uber, the ride-booking service, and an alliance of German automakers have submitted rival bids of up to $3 billion to acquire the Nokia division. A deal is widely expected by the end of the month. If one happens, there is likely to be a lot of angst to go around in the tech industry. Nokia’s mapping service is the main global competitor to Google Maps. But if a new owner decides to restrict access to Here’s vast, 30-year-old trove of mapping data, some of the largest tech companies could find themselves relying on Google’s mapping services once more. That could put companies like Amazon and Yahoo in a difficult position, potentially requiring them to share valuable location and routing data with one of their most powerful rivals in Silicon Valley. “There are too many businesses out there that want an independent service,” ​said Harold ​Goddijn, chief executive of TomTom, the Dutch digital mapping company that licenses data to Apple for its mapping service. ​“They don​’​t want to share customer data with ​Googl​e. ​They want users to stay within their domain.” As part of the German automakers’ bid, the companies, which include BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz, want to give access to Nokia’s mapping service, under licensing agreements, so others can still use its global geospatial data, according to a person who spoke on the condition of anonymity. It remains unclear whether Uber would follow suit if it acquired the unit. “Mapping is an extremely hard thing to do and takes years to replicate,” said Shyam Kumar, a senior analyst whose firm, TT Focus Fund, is an investor in both TomTom and Nokia. “If you cannot get access to another independent map, you might end up having to license from one of your major competitors. There’s obviously an inherent tension here.” The sudden interest in Here belies its often overlooked position in the technology world. While Google Maps is used in more than one billion smartphones worldwide, the Nokia unit, which until recently was somewhat hampered by the Finnish company’s close relationship with Microsoft, has instead focused primarily on offering mapping services to other companies, instead of directly to consumers. FedEx, for example, has used Here’s mapping data to manage its fleet of delivery trucks worldwide. Deutsche Telekom, the German carrier that owns T-Mobile, has built smartphone apps with Nokia’s services that allows people to share their locations with friends and family through their cellphones. But it’s the automotive industry, where Here holds up to an 80 percent global market share for built-in car navigation systems, that has become a main focus. The mapping service has becoming a crucial component for the automakers pursuing driverless car projects. In 2013, for instance, Mercedes-Benz teamed up with Here to test an autonomous car around 60 miles of German roads. The trial included instant 3-D modeling of nearby cars and constant corrections from the car’s  computer. So far, many automakers have preferred to use Nokia’s services over those provided by Google because of the search giant’s own ambitions in the nascent driverless car industry. Yet Nokia’s mapping technology may become unavailable if a new owner of the mapping unit decides to limit what other companies can do with the data.Uber Lures Top Google Executive and Shifts David Plouffe’s Duties: Continuing its quest for top Silicon Valley talent, Uber said on Wednesday that it had hired Rachel Whetstone, Google’s longtime head of communications, to be its senior vice president for policy and communications. While Ms. Whetstone’s appointment is a prominent talent grab for Uber, the ride-hailing start-up, it also shuffles the highest ranks of the company. She will take over the role of David Plouffe, the political strategist and former campaign manager for President Obama. Uber simultaneously confirmed that Mr. Plouffe will move to a position as chief adviser to the company and to Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, as well as take a seat on Uber’s board. It is an abrupt change to the six-year-old start-up’s communications team, as Mr. Plouffe was hired less than a year ago to run the company’s communications strategy. At the time of his appointment, the company described his role as similar to that of running a political campaign, with Uber as “the candidate.” His abilities were even praised by executives outside Uber. “David is uniquely suited to scale and lead the same kind of insurgent campaign he did in 2008 for a Silicon Valley tech company, bridging the worlds of business and politics,” Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s executive chairman, said at the time. Since Mr. Plouffe joined Uber, the company has been more aggressive about polishing its image, engaging in fewer public skirmishes and offering a gentler public tone. Uber has tried mending fences with European regulators who are wary of the service, and has undertaken numerous charitable efforts, including pickups for clothing donations and food-drive charity efforts. Over time, it has reduced the number of headlines about its pugnacious tendency to play rough with competitors. Ms. Whetstone, who will join Uber in June, has been at Google 10 years, helping lead it through antitrust battles across two continents and investigations by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as numerous consumer privacy inquiries. Her move to Uber was first reported by the tech news site Recode. She is another in a string of Google communications employees who have left the company to join hot start-ups. Last fall, Jill Hazelbaker left for Snapchat, while others have left for companies like Square, Pinterest and Tesla. But Ms. Whetstone’s departure is different. Uber and Google have long been partners in certain areas — Uber relies on Google’s mapping technology and has taken hundreds of millions from Google’s venture capital arm — but both companies have started to distance themselves from one another. Uber has made a bid for Nokia’s mapping unit, Here, which could lessen the company’s reliance on Google.Its OK to Fail - India learns to 'fail fast' as tech start-up culture takes root: After ping pong tables, motivational posters and casual dress codes, India's tech start-ups are following Silicon Valley's lead and embracing the \"fail fast\" culture credited with fuelling creativity and success in the United States. Taking failure as a norm is a major cultural shift in India, where high-achieving children are typically expected to take steady jobs at recognized firms. A failed venture hurts family status and even marriage prospects. But that nascent acceptance, fueled by returning engineers and billions of dollars in venture fund investment, is for many observers a sign that India's $150 billion tech industry is coming of age, moving from a back office powerhouse to a creative force. \"There is obviously increased acceptance,\" said Raghunandan G, co-founder of TaxiForSure, which was sold to rival Ola this year. He is now investing in others' early stage ventures. \"My co-founder Aprameya (Radhakrishna) used to have lines of prospective brides to meet ... the moment we started our own company, all those prospective alliances disappeared. No one wanted their daughters to marry a start-up guy.\" Srikanth Chunduri returned to India after studying at Duke University in the United States, and is now working on his second venture. \"I think what's encouraging is that acceptance of failure is increasing despite the very deep-rooted Asian culture where failure is a big no,\" he said. The shift has come about, executives say, as engineers began returning from Silicon Valley to cash in on India's own boom, as hundreds of millions of Indians go online. \"Investors too want to find the next Flipkart, and most of them come from Silicon Valley backgrounds, so they bring that culture,\" said Stewart Noakes, co-founder of TechHub, a global community and workspace for tech entrepreneurs. \"That's changing the Indian norms. It's becoming ok to fail and try again.\"Aliyun, Alibaba's Cloud Unit, Makes Push in the Middle East, to set up Data Center in Dubai: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s cloud-computing subsidiary is teaming up with Dubai-based Meraas Holding LLC as the company uses its technology to extend its influence beyond China. The joint venture of Alibaba’s Aliyun and Meraas will provide a broad swath of technology to businesses and governments in the Middle East and North Africa. Jack Ma, Alibaba’s executive chairman, and the rest of the Hangzhou, China-based multinational’s management team, laid the groundwork for the deal in a meeting last September with the ruler of Dubai, Aliyun President Simon Hu said in an interview. The joint venture will provide technical services for transportation, communication, urban infrastructure, electricity service, economic development, and urban planning, as well as cloud computing, Hu said. In a presentation to investors this month, Alibaba said that an expansion of cloud computing services was a priority for the coming fiscal year. “At the end of this year or next year, no matter where you are when you go to Dubai, no matter whether eating or sightseeing, you will encounter one of the infrastructures that is provided by Aliyun,” Hu said. As part of the venture, Aliyun and Meraas will build a technology hub consisting of a data center, along with hospitality, residential and commercial spaces. By expanding its cloud abroad, Aliyun ratchets up competition with companies such as Microsoft Corp., Google Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. These U.S. firms haven’t put large data centers in the Middle East. More hereAfter Big-Bang Start, Can Tesla's Battery Hit $1 Billion Faster Than the iPhone? Tesla’s new line of big, stackable batteries for homes and businesses started with a bang. The reservations reported in the first week are valued at roughly $800 million, according to numbers crunched by Bloomberg. If Tesla converts even a fraction of those reservations into actual sales, the battery roll-out could measure up as one of the biggest ever for a new product category. The new line of storage batteries is designed to extend solar power into the night and save companies money on its electric bills during expensive peak hours. Any comparison of batteries to smartphones and erection pills is, of course, a stretch. Most of Tesla’s battery revenue will come from utilities, not the consumers who snapped up iPhones and Viagra. The price of the new batteries is also much higher. Tesla’s Powerwall units designed for home users cost $3,000 to $3,500 per unit, not including installation, while the commercial batteries are sold in roughly $25,000 incremental blocks. Tesla hasn’t even defined what qualifies as a \"reservation\" at this point. Of the $800 million in reservations from the first week, almost $625 million came from businesses and utilities that would seem likely to complete the transaction. The remaining reservations from home users are little more than expressions of interest made through a no-strings online reservation system. Manufacturing giant batteries will also be much more difficult to scale than Pfizer’s little blue pill, which was filling 46,000 prescriptions a day by the end of its first month on the market. Tesla won't begin shipping batteries until this summer, and it’s already sold out through mid-2016. Still, approaching $1 billion of interest, just days after introducing path-breaking product, marks a significant achievement. Tesla is going to need that battery revenue as soon as it can get it: The company is burning through cash to invest in the Model X electric SUV due later this year, the more affordable Model 3 slated to arrive 2017, and a $5 billion battery factory to power it all.  In a call with analysts last week, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk wouldn’t rule out the possibility that the battery business could someday exceed electric-car revenue.   Electricity storage products aren't new. But Tesla’s price, power, and packaging set these batteries apart in a way that echoes the gap between the first iPhone and the smartphones that came before it. Now Musk has brought an Apple-launch level of public interest to what's essentially a infrastructure product, albeit one with potential to transform the way electrical grids are managed and the speed that solar power is adopted.  The next daunting challenge will be to turn that interest into bookable revenue for Tesla. Xiaomi’s rolls out a money market fund  to take on Alibaba and Tencent: Like Baidu and Alibaba, Xiaomi is eyeing China’s finance industry and seeing dollar signs. Today the company is officially launching a money-market fund called Huoqibao inside a new standalone app called “Xiaomi Finance.” Like the Alibaba-affiliated Yu’ebao, Xiaomi’s Huoqibao lets consumers save excess cash and earn interest from it. After registering for a Xiaomi Finance account with one’s national ID, users can bind a bank card to the app can store as little as RMB 1 (about US$0.15). The fund is managed by China’s E Fund Management and currently offers an annual return rate of 4.26 percent. This marks Xiaomi’s first foray into serious finance, but it has dabbled in money in the past. Huoqibao was once available in beta for select users of Xiaomi Wallet, another standalone app that was primarily used to manage virtual currency known as Mi coins. Users from inside China could purchase Mi coins through bound bank cards or Alipay accounts, and redeem them for customized launcher themes, or media like e-books. Compared to China’s other internet giants, Xiaomi is slightly late to the money market game. As of late 2014, Yu’ebao had over 185 million users] and and a fund size of RMB 578.93 billion (about US$93 billion). Yu’ebao’s deep integration with Alipay Wallet, which is also tied to Alibaba’s mobile ecommerce properties like Tmall and Taobao, make it tough for new customers to miss. Tencent and Baidu also have mobile money-market funds of their own. Of these three companies, Xiaomi is arguably in the weakest position when it comes to promoting consumer finance products. Alibaba already owns the biggest pool of money online in China thanks to Alipay, and Tencent owns the best mobile real estate thanks to WeChat, China’s most popular messaging app. Messaging apps and ecommerce marketplaces both contain powerful network effects that help ensure longevity. Unlike these companies (and arguably any other company in the world), Xiaomi is extremely well positioned to benefit from the emergence of smart home devices. Since thousands of customers log onto Xiaomi’s website to buy a smartphones every week, it can leverage that focused attention by selling smart lightbulbs and smart cameras and taking a cut in the process. Many of the hardware startups it invests in go on to list their items on the company’s ecommerce platform. Documents discovered last year by the Wall Street Journal indicated that Xiaomi makes the majority of its revenue and profits from hardware sales. But the company continues to invest in “services” – broadly defined as all of the semi-tangibles one buys on the internet. The company claimed to earn more than US$1 billlion in revenues from services in 2014, marking 6 percent of its total revenues.Chinese Smartphone Makers Try to Make Inroads in India: The era of fast growth is coming to an end in China, where the research group IDC said on Monday that phone sales fell 4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the first contraction in six years. IDC expects no growth in China’s smartphone market in 2015. India’s smartphone sales are just a fraction of China’s. But as one of the fastest-growing smartphone markets in the world, with hundreds of millions of potential new customers, India may indicate whether a new generation of Chinese hardware companies can grow beyond their country’s borders. It is intensely competitive, with more than 150 brands. Among the best-selling brands are several indigenous companies with an inside track on local phone habits. Another top seller is a multinational, Samsung, which has deep experience selling across different cultures. Xiaomi, the most successful Chinese company in India, owned only 4 percent of the market in the fourth quarter. But India is also the only place that has a scale like China’s. Indians are expected to buy 111 million smartphones this year, and 149 million in 2016. And China’s smartphone makers say Chinese and Indian customers have a lot in common: Both tend to obsess over arcane features and specs, and both are highly sensitive to cost. Many Chinese companies are trying to make their case directly to potential Indian buyers online. It is a technique pioneered by Xiaomi, which used e-commerce to overcome difficult-to-manage and expensive storefronts and distribution deals in China and now India. So-called flash sales, which offer limited batches of phones to drive up demand and build brand cachet, have rattled the current top sellers in India, the local company Micromax and the South Korean giant Samsung, according to analysts. The tactic is cheap and effective, said Mr. Sharma of Coolpad: “We don’t need to spend tens of millions of dollars on marketing or building distribution networks.” One of the most successful Chinese brands in India so far, Xiaomi has gone to great lengths to create products catering to customers there. Its new Mi 4i phone costs more than many rivals at about $200, but supports six Indian languages, with local engineers working to increase that number. The company has also built an online store that focuses on India’s passions of cricket and Bollywood, and has plans to open 100 stores around the country before the end of the year. “We want to become an Indian company,” Xiaomi’s chief executive, Lei Jun, told a local newspaper after the introduction of the Mi 4i.SoftBank names Nikesh Arora President and Son's Likely Successor: Japan's SoftBank Corp unveiled a management reshuffle on Monday, appointing investments head Nikesh Arora as president and naming him as a potential successor to CEO Masayoshi Son, as the telecoms conglomerate steps up its overseas expansion. The move comes as Son and SoftBank are battling to make their 2013 acquisition of U.S. carrier Sprint Corp for more than $20 billion profitable. A sluggish Japanese economy, though, has forced the company to increasingly look overseas for growth. Announcing Arora's appointment at SoftBank's earnings conference, billionaire Son, who is relinquishing the president's post, said the former Google Inc executive was a \"strong candidate\" to lead the company in future. \"Yes. He's 10 years younger than me, and he has more abilities than me,\" Son told reporters, when asked if Arora was a potential candidate to succeed him. \"The last nine months I've spent with him have made me sure of that, but I'm not going to retire soon,\" Son said. SoftBank has been weighed down by the costs of trying to turn around Sprint, which has been in intense competition with larger U.S. rivals AT&T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc. Sprint, in which SoftBank owns 80 percent, has undergone a long-haul revamping of its network, shedding thousands of jobs and triggering a mass exodus of subscribers. SoftBank has made a string of other investments in recent years, including $250 million in privately-held Hollywood movie studio Legendary Entertainment, and $600 million in Travice Inc, the operator of Chinese taxi hailing app Kuaidi Dache. As well as being the largest investor in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, SoftBank has plans to invest $10 billion in India's potentially huge but under-developed online retail market. \"We expect more investments and acquisitions, even more so than now,\" Son said. \"Going forward, the overseas market will be the main factor for SoftBank.\" SoftBank posted a 9 percent fall in operating profit for the year ended March to 982.7 billion yen ($8.2 billion), hurt by the absence of one-time gains enjoyed the year before.In global first, Uber tests cash payments for cabs in India: Uber is testing cash payments in India as the online taxi-hailing company seeks a stronger foothold in a country where many fewer people have credit cards than internet connections. San Francisco-based Uber has grown rapidly in value to be worth around $40 billion. But in India it has lagged local rival Ola, which has about 80 percent of the organized cab market. Many analysts say that is because Uber has not adapted its business model enough to suit India's needs. Uber said on Tuesday it was piloting cash payments for cabs in the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, in a first for the company globally. Until now, Uber's mobile application around the world has charged customers through credit cards or other electronic payment methods. India has about 20 million credit cards for a population of 1.3 billion. Though the government is trying to change this, most purchases are done with cash. Ola and other Indian cab services accept cash for rides, while e-commerce giant Amazon introduced a cash on delivery option when it launched in India. \"Tradition dictates that cash plays a big role for Indian consumers,\" said Siddharth Shanker, Uber's general manager in Hyderabad.In 1.7M miles of test drives over 6 years, Google's self-driving cars have been in only 11 accidents, and caused none: Internet search company Google Inc's self-driving cars have been involved in 11 accidents, but have not been the cause of any, over the last six years since the project began, the program's director said on Monday. A team of drivers that is testing the fleet of more than 20 vehicles have driven 1.7 million miles so far. \"...Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident,\" Chris Urmson said in a post on technology news website Backchannel's blog Medium. (bit.ly/1GZciuW) No one was injured in the accidents, Urmson added. \"If you spend enough time on the road, accidents will happen whether you're in a car or a self-driving car.\" The cars had been hit from behind seven times, mainly at traffic lights, with a majority of the accidents being on city streets rather than on freeways.Late to the party, global banks try to muscle into India's start-up boom: Global investment banks are scrambling to get a piece of the action from India's booming technology start-ups, having missed out on the initial flurry of deal-making to their better-connected but much smaller domestic rivals. Banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are looking to hire more bankers in India and are now regularly attending \"bake-offs\" to pitch for advisory roles on deals, according to several banking industry sources. Foreign money has been pouring into India's fast-growing e-commerce sector, with investors ranging from Japan's Softbank Corp to Singapore's Temasek Holdings [TEM.UL] and GIC Private Ltd [GIC.UL] piling in. Many large global investment banks have stayed away from work in the emerging sector though due to the relatively small deal sizes. Now they are stepping up efforts to build relationships while the companies are still young - learning lessons from China where many of them are struggling to compete with small boutique banks as Internet deals pick up speed. \"Several of these companies will be large IPO candidates in the next 12 to 24 months, so the big banks have to start positioning themselves for this,\" said Harish HV, a partner in India at advisory firm Grant Thornton. The number of venture funding deals for technology start-ups in India in the first quarter of 2015 was the highest in nine quarters and exceeded the number of such deals in China, according to data from CB Insights. The total value of investments in India topped $1 billion for the third straight quarter. To compete with local rivals like Avendus Capital and Kotak Mahindra Capital, foreign banks are now pitching for relatively small deals at start-ups, hopeful they will eventually lead to more lucrative work, banking sources said. Avendus, which focused on the tech sector before the deal momentum picked up, ranks fourth in the advisory league table for announced technology deals in India so far this year. That's ahead of bigger global rivals including Credit Suisse, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan, according to Thomson Reuters data. Now foreign investment banks are starting to make in-roads. Jefferies' India arm advised home shopping firm Naaptol.com to raise about $20 million last month from Japan's Mitsui & Co Ltd and some existing investors. Citigroup Inc, which advised Indian online payment services provider One97 Communications in raising funds from Alibaba Group affiliate Ant Financial Services in February, is \"very focused\" on the internet space in India, said Madhur Deora, its managing director for investment banking in India. Global banks vying to offer services like loan financing to online retailers like Flipkart and Snapdeal, hoping this could help them secure mandates on any future IPOs, sources said.Alibaba in talks to buy $1.2 billion stake in India phone maker Micromax - 20% stake purchase would value Micromax at $6B: Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N) is in talks with India's Micromax Informatics (IPO-MINF.NS) to buy an about 20 percent stake in the smartphone maker, helping the Chinese e-commerce giant expand in one of the world's fastest growing markets for the devices, several people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The deal, if completed, would see Alibaba investing as much as $1.2 billion in Micromax, the second-largest smartphone brand in India by sales, at up to $6 billion, two of the people said. India is the world's third largest smartphone market and was the fastest growing in the Asia Pacific region in the third quarter of last year, according to industry research firm International Data Corporation. Micromax and Alibaba began talks on the stake sale after discussions with investors led by Japanese telecoms firm Softbank Corp (9984.T) stalled over differences in valuations, the sources said. \"The Softbank talks are not officially over, but it'll be hard to get back on track,\" said one of the people. Softbank is the largest shareholder in Alibaba. The sources said Alibaba wants to use the Micromax deal to tap into the boom in the number of internet users in India, which is also one of the world's most rapidly growing smartphone markets. Growth in India, and especially in mobile transactions, would help Alibaba offset stiff competition at home from domestic rivals including JD.com Inc (JD.O), as well as what appears to be growing e-commerce user saturation. \"The talks are centered around using Micromax devices as a platform to get into a serious business of its own in India,\" said one of the sources, referring to Alibaba. Alibaba, for example, would be able to roll out services such as Alipay, its online payment platform, on Micromax phones. Ant Financial Services Group, which owns Alipay, is China's largest payment service provider and is controlled by Alibaba's executive chairman and founder Jack Ma. The stake sale is aimed at helping Micromax raise capital as it expands into new business segments including personal computing. The company is seeking funds from private investors, or a possible stock market listing, its co-founder told Reuters. Micromax started up in India in 2008, and its affordable, large-screen phones are now the country's most popular after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) smartphones. Micromax counts Sequoia Capital and TA Associates among its investors.Uber might raised $1.5B at $50B valuation: Uber is fund-raising again. The mobile car-hailing application is in early talks to raise a new round of financing that could value the start-up at $50 billion, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke anonymously because the process is confidential. Uber could raise around $1.5 billion, given the amount of interest from investors in the company, the person said. The new capital will not be used primarily for expansion purposes, unlike Uber’s previous financing rounds. Instead, the funding is strategic, with an eye on partnerships, the person said. Uber, based in San Francisco, has raised money relentlessly in recent years at rapidly swelling valuations. So far, the company has raised more than $4 billion as it moves into new markets globally, disrupting established taxi and other transportation industries by letting people request rides through their smartphones. The company was founded in 2009 and is led by Travis Kalanick, who is chief executive. In December, Uber closed a $1.2 billion round of financing that valued it at $40 billion. The company then moved to accommodate additional investors like Baidu, the Chinese Internet giant. That round followed one in June, when the service said that it had raised $1.2 billion at a valuation of $17 billion. At a $50 billion valuation, Uber would be the world’s most valuable private start-up, topping the Chinese electronics maker Xiaomi, which was last valued at $45 billion. It would also be worth more than publicly traded companies like FedEx, with a market value of $48 billion, and Nissan Motor, with a capitalization of $47 billion. The divide between Uber and other “unicorns” — Silicon Valley’s term for billion-dollar start-ups — would also grow. Even at its current $40 billion valuation, it was nearly triple that of other elite Silicon Valley start-ups like the data analysis firm Palantir, according to the research firm CB Insights. Among Silicon Valley start-ups, only Facebook had attained a $50 billion valuation as a private company.Pinterest Adds $186M To Series G Funding Round, Offers Secondary Sale To Employees Looking to Cash Out: Pinterest confirmed that it has padded its Series G funding a bit and is carrying out a new secondary sale that will allow employees to cash in some of their shares. As first reported by Re/code, the social sharing startup raised an additional $186 million in funding as part of its Series G round, bringing the total amount raised in that financing to $553 million. New investors in the round include Wellington Management Company and Goldman Sachs, while existing investors Andreessen Horowitz, Bessemer, First Mark, SV Angel, Valiant, and Fidelity also participated. Altogether, the company has raised about $1.3 billion since being founded in 2009. In addition to the primary financing, Pinterest is carrying out a secondary sale for employees who wish to sell their vested at the $11 billion valuation of the Series G round. This is the second time Pinterest has offered the option of a secondary sale to its employees, with the first being held in October 2012.Leadership Change at Alibaba: In the surprise leadership change, Mr. Ma picked Daniel Zhang, who has been at Alibaba for eight years, to lead one of the world’s largest Internet companies. Mr. Ma, in a letter to employees, portrayed the replacement of the chief executive, Jonathan Lu, as a sort of changing of the guard. ”Alibaba Group is ready to completely hand over management leadership to those of you who were born in the ’70s,” Mr. Ma wrote, adding that several other experienced Alibaba leaders would give up some day-to-day control to allow younger executives to rise. Mr. Zhang, who was born in 1972, has become well known among employees at Alibaba for his public speaking and charisma. Leading Alibaba’s investment call on Thursday, Mr. Zhang’s polished English underlined the divide between himself and Mr. Ma, who, though once an English teacher, speaks a more unorthodox, self-taught brand of the language. Within Alibaba, there is admiration for Mr. Zhang’s cosmopolitan management style, in part honed during stints early in his career at Arthur Andersen and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Mr. Lu, who is only a few years older than his replacement, is scheduled to step down as chief executive on Sunday, exactly two years after he took over from Mr. Ma. At the time of his ascent, he was portrayed as a utility player who would help the ballooning start-up manage its rapid growth. Mr. Lu will remain on the board. To many Alibaba employees, Mr. Zhang, who led the rise of the company’s Tmall shopping site, is known as one of the most capable of the new generation of leaders. Mr. Zhang will need all the youthful energy he can manage to steer an e-commerce goliath that employs more than 30,000 people across the globe. He will very likely move quickly to address company inefficiencies that Mr. Ma identified last week in a speech to employees in Beijing. During the speech, Mr. Ma said the company would strive not to have a net growth in employees over the coming year. Instead, he said, Alibaba will work to transfer employees between departments and use technology to smooth operations.Google, Dominant in Search, Tries Disruptor Role in Wireless and Broadband: In the stodgy wireless service industry, long dominated by AT&T and Verizon, with struggling Sprint and feisty T-Mobile a distant third and fourth, the possibility that a new competitor might upend this cozy oligopoly has long been considered a pipe dream. When the Justice Department sued to block the proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile in 2011, it concluded it was highly unlikely that other competitors would enter the market. Last year, Sprint abandoned its bid for T-Mobile after the Justice Department suggested that deal, too, would be anticompetitive. But now Google’s entry into wireless — named Project Fi — has changed the conversation about competition in that market, even though Google said the move was still an experiment. “I’m delighted that Google is doing this,” said Scott Hemphill, visiting professor of antitrust and intellectual property at New York University School of Law. “This is an industry that’s ripe for disruption.” Google’s wireless business certainly seems disruptive. It takes direct aim at the fat profit margins and high prices of the dominant firms. Google is charging $20 a month for basic voice and text service, and $10 for a gigabyte of cellular data, according to a blog post on the company’s website. And in a move unheard-of among traditional wireless providers, Google will rebate payments to customers for any unused data. Google’s service also uses a combination of innovative technology and partnerships with existing cellular providers to overcome its lack of wireless spectrum. Project Fi uses Wi-Fi networks whenever possible (hence its name) and, when Wi-Fi isn’t available, moves seamlessly to cellular networks. The cellular networks are provided by Sprint and T-Mobile, the current cell service underdogs. In the high-speed broadband market, even the prospect of Google’s coming to town has caused entrenched providers to improve their service in anticipation of a new competitive threat. After Google said it would bring its fiber service to the Charlotte, N.C., market, Time Warner Cable announced it was offering a free higher-speed upgrade to its customers there.Facebook's Oculus to sell virtual reality headsets for consumers from early 2016. Virtual reality technology company Oculus said it would start shipping the much-awaited consumer version of its Rift headset in the first quarter of 2016. Pre-orders for Rift will start later this year, Oculus, which Facebook Inc bought for $2 billion last year, said. Previous versions of the VR headset, available since 2012, were aimed at developers to make games and run tests. The consumer version was widely expected sometime this year. \"In the weeks ahead, we'll be revealing the details around hardware, software, input, and many of our unannounced made-for-VR games and experiences coming to the Rift,\" the company said on a blog post.Apple Is Planning Another Big Bond Sale: Apple Inc. is planning to sell bonds in the iPhone maker’s fourth multi-billion dollar offering since 2013 as it borrows to return capital to shareholders while preserving its cash holdings abroad. The company will issue the securities in as many as seven parts today, with the longest-dated bonds maturing in 30 years, according to a person with knowledge of the offering. Proceeds will back stock repurchases, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt repayment, said the person, who asked not to be identified because of a lack of authorization to speak publicly. Apple may sell the bonds due in 2045 at a yield of 1.5 percentage points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and 10-year notes at a 1.10 percentage-point premium, said the person. The company is also planning to issue fixed and floating-rate notes maturing in two and five years and a seven-year fixed-rate bond. The Cupertino, California-based company has issued the equivalent of $40.35 billion of bonds since April 2013, including the $17 billion it sold in what at the time was the biggest corporate-bond offering ever. The company may also sell its first yen bonds and has arranged a series of fixed-income investor calls starting Thursday, Goldman Sachs, one of the underwriters of that offering, said in an e-mailed statement. A sale would be the first in the Japanese currency for Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Affirm, consumer lending start-up raises $275M to lend to young borrowers using data science: Affirm is adding $275 million in debt and equity to accelerate its growth plans. The big Series B funding round is a vote of confidence by investors in one of the more ambitious entrants into the emerging field of financial technology. The firm is at the forefront of start-ups trying to use the new math of data science to more accurately assess credit risk than traditional scoring, which relies heavily on a person’s credit history. Conventional techniques, the new lenders say, do not do a good job of predicting the default risk on people with limited credit histories, like young people and recent immigrants. Traditional credit analysis tools, they add, tend to overly punish borrowers for single missteps such as a missed student loan payment or falling behind on medical debt. Affirm is building its business by focusing on lending to the millennial market, those under 35 years of age. They tend to have thin credit histories, and surveys show they generally have a lowly opinion of banks. “We’re building a financial technology company for the next generation,” said Max Levchin, the chief executive of Affirm, who was a co-founder of PayPal. To date, Affirm’s main product is a credit-card alternative for online merchants — installment loans from three months to a year. To seek a loan, an applicant provides a few items of personal information — name, cellphone number, birth date and the last four digits of the person’s Social Security number. Then, Affirm’s algorithms pore through all kinds of data from credit bureau reports to social networks. Affirm’s technology makes the underwriting decision almost immediately. More than 100 online merchants have signed up with Affirm, which has made more than $100 million in loans. Merchants using Affirm, the company says, report 20 percent higher sales, reflecting the appeal of Affirm’s alternative to credit cards. The tryout phase for the two-year-old company’s technology, Mr. Levchin said, is over. “We’ve come of age, so we want to have the resources to expand,” he said. New products, Mr. Levchin said, are part of the plan, including a credit-card offering.India Start-up Action: Logistic services firm Delhivery raises $85M to ride on India’s ecommerce boom: Riding on the back of an ecommerce boom, India-based logistics service Delhivery raised a series D round of US$85 million led by Tiger Global Management. Last year, the company received US$35 million from Multiples Alternate Asset Management, Nexus Venture Partners, and Times Internet Limited. These investors have also participated in this round. This has so far been the biggest deal for an ecommerce support venture in India. Delhivery has a range of proprietary commerce technologies that they’ve built in-house to tackle logistics problems. The company has over 10,000 employees in more than 200 cities along with nearly a million square feet of warehousing space in 11 fulfilment centers. It handles over 3 million monthly transactions for 70,000 merchants and 1,500 ecommerce companies. With the funding, it plans to tap into India’s rural market and build 2.5 million square feet fulfilment centers. The startup aims to expand its reach four-fold. Delhivery is also expected to invest heavily in expanding the senior management team. It has recently appointed Sandeep Barasia, senior partner of Bain and Company and Suraju Dutta, ex-FedEx executive, as managing directors.Aftermath of Secret's Shutdown: Google Ventures Managing Partner Criticizes Founders for 'Taking Money Off the Table': For many in Silicon Valley, the rapid rise and precipitous fall of Secret, the prominent start-up that recently closed its doors, will most likely serve as a cautionary tale of how not to run a company. For Google Ventures, one of Secret’s earliest backers, it will also be a reminder of the type of company not to invest in. The product of two former Google employees, David Byttow and Chrys Bader, Secret attracted intense media interest early in its life. The app let users anonymously share “secrets” to their network of close friends and friends of friends, an activity that quickly caught on among founders, investors and the media of Silicon Valley. It also helped that Secret took some early rounds of funding from Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, two big venture capital firms. After the flurry of attention and just a few months later, Secret opted to raise another round of financing, this time seeking $25 million. Bill Maris, managing partner of Google Ventures, did not think it was a good idea and the company did not participate. “We advised them against it,” Mr. Maris said in an interview, referring to Secret’s leaders. “We told them they didn’t need the money. And raising that much money that soon, it was going to be impossible to meet the expectations in the future.” The discussion could be considered a case of life imitating art, or perhaps vice versa: In a recent episode of Silicon Valley, the satirical HBO series, a young start-up founder is offered millions of dollars from multiple venture capital firms at high valuations. Ultimately, the founder is advised to instead accept a lower offer, in order to make future funding rounds more achievable and growth targets reasonable. That is not what the founders of Secret chose to do. The company completed its $25 million financing led by Index Ventures and Redpoint Ventures, along with a variety of individual angel investors. In that round, the two founders each wanted to take $3 million off the table for themselves, a practice that is commonplace for more mature companies, but less so for very young start-ups. Not joining the $25 million round proved to be a wise choice for Google Ventures. Downloads of Secret declined over 2014, according to App Annie, an app analytics service. Secret redesigned its entire app to look like a near-perfect clone of Yik Yak, a competing service, but traffic did not improve. Many employees, including Mr. Bader, left the company. Last week, Mr. Byttow said he was shutting down his company, and would return the remainder of the money to the venture capital firms. Neither Mr. Byttow nor Mr. Bader have said if that includes the $6 million the two of them took off the table and deposited into their bank accounts.In 2014 Jabong’s GMV grew 2.5x to Rs1320Cr; Ended Year with INR 289 Crore Cash; Lost INR 454 Crore on EBITDA Basis: Rocket Internet-incubated lifestyle e-tailer Jabong.com more than doubled its gross merchandise value (GMV) to Rs 1,320.6 crore during the calender year ended December 31, 2014. The firm’s GMV captures value of total transactions, excluding taxes and shipping costs but including value of paid vouchers and coupons. The firm had ended 2013 with GMV of Rs 511.4 crore, data pulled from its latest annual statistics show. The data is net of returns and cancellations. Jabong shipped 8.7 million orders last year of which 5.9 million transactions represented products sold by Jabong while another 2.8 million orders or close to one in three orders were through its marketplace. This means the firm handled on an average 23,835 orders a day last year as compared to 16,164 in 2013. The company’s net revenues (which captures the sales by the firm as against GMV which includes sales by third party vendors too, for which the company just gets a listing fee) grew 2.3x to Rs 811.4 crore last year. Meanwhile, its loss at an operating level as captured by EBITDA (adjusted for share based compensation) rose to Rs 454 crore as against Rs 236 crore in 2013. This means, for every Re 1 worth of sales it books directly (not covering third party vendors), it is losing around 56 paisa. This is still an improvement over the previous year when it was booking operating loss of over two thirds (68.5 per cent) of whatever it sold. The firm did see its cash position dwindle as a result ending 2014 with Rs 289.4 crore as against Rs 853.2 crore the previous year.Home Depot Aiming to Put Apple Pay in Its 2,000 Stores: Home Depot Inc. has the goal of offering Apple Inc.’s mobile-payment platform at its more than 2,000 stores, which would make it the largest retailer yet to accept Apple Pay. Customers already were able to use Apple Pay at some of Home Depot’s stores despite there not being an agreement. The world’s largest home-improvement retailer could accept mobile payments at those locations because its checkout terminals have near-field communication readers. Those devices have now been turned off for the past few weeks during an upgrade of its point-of-sale system, Holmes said. That led to some inaccurate reports that Home Depot had dropped Apple Pay. If it pushes ahead with the plan, Home Depot would join chains like Macy’s Inc. and Whole Foods Market Inc. in embracing Apple Pay at stores. Many other retailers are betting on a mobile-payment option from the Merchant Customer Exchange, which was founded in 2012 by companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. That offering, CurrentC, is still being developed.3-D Printing Is Saving the Italian Artisan: Italy’s craftsmen turn to a new tool in their competition with cheap products from China. Northeast Italy’s industrial heartland stretches roughly from Milan to Venice, along the floodplains of the Po River all the way to the Adriatic.  Like much of the rest of the country, however, the region has fallen on hard times. Italy’s craftsmen have been undermined by competition from China and other parts of Asia. Since the beginning of the global economic crisis, the northeast’s industrial sector has shed about 135,000 jobs—some 17 percent of its total workforce. Techniques such as the 3D printing used by Pomini and Armani have helped turn northeastern Italy into an unlikely hothouse of innovation. Last year growth in the region was positive for the first time since 2007, at 0.5 percent. Exports rose by 3.5 percent in 2014 and are expected to keep climbing. In the province of Trento, for instance, the public and private sectors together invest some 2 percent of gross domestic product in research and development. At the Centro Moda Canossa—a trade school in Trento for children age 14 to 18 specializing in fashion design and tailoring—the faculty recently added a class in which students incorporate 3D printing, laser cutting, and microcontroller chips into their designs. “You can’t offer a job from the past. Nobody will come,” says Michele Bommassar, 36, the school’s vice director. “You have to offer the jobs of the future.” He points to a student project, a purse with a laser-cut pattern on its flap and an interior that lights up when it’s opened: “It’s beautiful, but we believe it is also necessary. The alternative is to be eaten by others.” At their best, these technologies inject elements of the digital economy into the physical world, allowing a galaxy of small companies to compete with multinationals, in much the same way homemade YouTube videos hold their own against traditional video production. The advent of rapid prototyping and other innovations means “you can compensate for your disadvantages with variety, customization, and a rapid response to what the market is demanding,” says Paolo Collini, a business professor and the dean of the University of Trento. Or, as Armani puts it: “If something doesn’t work, you simply stop producing. You haven’t filled a warehouse. For a designer, it’s a dream. You can take more risks.”Tech-centric Elementary School Chain Raises $100M from Zuckerberg, Others: Add an elementary school to the list of ventures attracting nine-figure sums from Silicon Valley investors. AltSchool, a chain of technology-centric private schools in San Francisco, has raised $100 million from Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, through his family's charitable organization, as well as from Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, and other backers. Founded by former Google executive Max Ventilla, AltSchool has been developing customized hardware and software that it says allows teachers to create more personalized education plans. Instead of having children follow the same curriculum throughout the year, lesson plans can be tailored to each student. Tuition costs about $21,000 a year, and the company eventually plans to sell its technology to other schools. \"Everything is instrumented through technology,\" Ventilla says. Tech investors have been pouring money into education-related companies. Spending on education startups last year increased 55 percent, to a record $1.87 billion, according to CB Insights, which tracks venture capital spending. In 1999, when the researcher started tracking education, financing within the industry was $385 million. AltSchool is different from many other education-tech companies, which typically build applications to help with math or reading. That's because it operates its own schools. The company started last year in a single San Francisco classroom with 20 students. This year, it plans to have eight schools serving 500 kids. Its first school outside of California will open later this year in—where else—Brooklyn, N.Y. After Ventilla sold his search startup, Aardvark, in 2010 to Google, where he worked until 2013, he became increasingly interested in what he describes as a failing education system in the U.S. The country ranks 14th—below Russia and other developed nations—in a Pearson study on global math, science, reading, literacy and graduation rates. One reason for that is a lack of funding for public schools, something Ventilla's hot tech startup no longer needs to worry about.Generational Shift at Cisco as longtime CEO John Chambers Steps Down: On Monday, perhaps the last veteran leader of the old guard signaled it was time to leave the corner office — if only for a move down the hall. John T. Chambers, chief executive of Cisco Systems since 1995, said he was stepping down effective July 26, to be succeeded by a longtime Cisco sales executive. “He is the last of the lions, presiding over years of incredible growth,” said George Colony, chief executive of Forrester Research, a market research firm. Cisco makes much of the gear that runs the Internet, notably digital information switches. It also supplies equipment for the world’s telecommunications infrastructure, and for teleconferencing, video and Wi-Fi networks. It had sales of $47.1 billion in the 2014 fiscal year, compared with $1.2 billion in 1994, just before Mr. Chambers took over. Mr. Chambers’s successor, Charles H. Robbins, is 49, and joined Cisco, the networking equipment maker, in 1997, just two years after Mr. Chambers became C.E.O. Mr. Chambers, 65, will remain as executive chairman. The company said that Mr. Chambers would spend time supporting the company’s new chief and “engaging closely with customers and governments around the world.” The transition is another sign of a generational shift in Silicon Valley. In September, Lawrence J. Ellison announced he would leave the C.E.O. position at Oracle, the world’s largest maker of database software. Like Mr. Chambers, Mr. Ellison became the company’s executive chairman and remains active. In August 2013, Steven A. Ballmer said he would step down as head of Microsoft, and he was succeeded in February 2014 by Satya Nadella. Unlike Mr. Ellison or Mr. Chambers, Mr. Ballmer cut his ties with Microsoft and left the board in August. He now gives commands from the courtside of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, which he purchased for $2 billion in May 2014. In addition, just months before Mr. Ballmer announced his decision to step down as Microsoft chief, there was a passing of the guard at the chip maker Intel, with Brian M. Krzanich becoming chief executive to succeed Paul S. Otellini. The year before, in 2012, Virginia M. Rometty took the place vacated by Samuel J. Palmisano as head of IBM. Even as the executive suites at these large companies have turned over, a web-focused and mobile-proficient group of companies now dominate the technology scene, including Facebook and Google. Many of these are run by much younger leaders than Mr. Chambers, especially Google’s Larry Page, 42, and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, 30. Their companies have powerful networks but are primarily devoted to software, and an ethos that information should be ubiquitous and shared. “Now it’s a young man’s game,” Mr. Colony said.With Big Names and Money Flowing In, Tech Start-Ups in India Heat Up: Intense interest from prominent investors is helping to drive eye-popping valuations among Indian tech start-ups. Venture capital firms, hedge funds and the likes of business executives such as Rupert Murdoch are all vying for a piece of India’s rapidly growing e-commerce market — particularly companies aimed at the growing number of aspiring middle-class consumers. It is a radical turnaround from just a few years ago, when fewer smartphones, a smaller number of Internet users, general government inertia and a lack of funding hampered many entrepreneurs and start-ups. Well-known investors like Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank; Jack Ma, the executive chairman of Alibaba; and Mr. Murdoch, the media tycoon, have all made investments in India’s e-commerce companies. They are going head-to-head with other experienced tech investors like Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners. Mr. Son said he would pump $10 billion into India, joking during a visit that he was “speed dating” entrepreneurs to gauge their passion. Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, posed on a festooned truck holding a $2 billion check to be invested in the company’s India unit. India’s market potential is enticing. Only 300 million Indians, or less than 25 percent of the country, are Internet users, and while that is already the second-largest Internet market in the world, after China, five million users are added each month, according to Rajan Anandan, Google India’s managing director. The number of Internet users in India is expected to reach 500 million in three years, he said. As investors rush in, the stampede has brought its own set of challenges. Despite the optimism, none of India’s e-commerce players are profitable yet. For now, it is a game of capturing market share, and the expenses are high as rivals try to distinguish themselves in front-page newspaper ads and prime-time TV commercials. There is also the matter of the aggressive valuations that start-up founders are demanding. News reports this year suggested that a deal between Alibaba and Snapdeal fell through because the two could not agree on a valuation. With such inflated prices, investors ought to be wary. Any downturn could take with it hundreds of millions of dollars of their money. “Follow-on financing offers land even before entrepreneurs have closed the previous round. It is a little chaotic,” said Shailendra Singh, managing partner at Sequoia Capital in India, which has investments in the cab-summoning app Ola and the restaurant and food platform Zomato. Investors get sticker shock as entrepreneurs demand outrageous multiples and stiff premiums. Mr. Singh said some demands were “uncomfortably high.” Still, the investor interest and money are being aggressively put to use by start-ups like Flipkart, which has tripled its number of employees in one year, to 33,000 as of March. It says it has averaged eight million shipments a month (compared with three million a year ago). It recently hired two Silicon Valley-based Google executives: Punit Soni, as its chief product officer, and Peeyush Ranjan, as its head of engineering. Both will be based in Bangalore, where Google has leased 1.5 million square feet for its new campus in an office park backed by the Blackstone Group, the private equity firm. Already, the value of goods sold on Snapdeal — which offers goods as varied as bulletproof cars and luggage made in Mumbai’s slums — exceeds that of India’s largest offline retailers, said Mr. Bahl, its co-founder. Experts see India’s e-commerce market at an inflection point. A recent Morgan Stanley report titled “The Next India” said Indian e-commerce would expand to $100 billion in revenue by 2020, from $2.9 billion in 2013, making it the world’s fastest-growing market. India’s youthful market makes it an e-commerce sweet spot, said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder of India’s largest mobile payments platform, Paytm. As in China, India’s smaller cities and towns lack retail infrastructure. In 5,000 cities and towns, tapping an app is the new equivalent of a visit to the mall, and it could unleash pent-up demand for the latest fashion or the newest device. India resembles China of seven to 10 years ago in its broadband Internet growth, creation of digital-native marketplaces and rapid user adoption. Even ideas like online grocers, which have just started to gain a foothold in places like Silicon Valley could do well in India. “So investors who won in China are playing in India. Those who missed in China, too, are playing in India. This is the land of opportunity,” Mr. Gururaj said.IHS: Apple Inc's Watch has the lowest ratio of hardware costs to retail price across any Apple phone, according to a preliminary estimate by research firm IHS after a teardown study. The hardware cost of an Apple Watch Sport model was about 24 percent of the suggested retail price compared with 29-38 percent for the iPhone maker's other products, IHS said on Thursday. (bit.ly/1zuOZMq) The Apple Watch Sport 38 mm costs $349 and the teardown shows a bill of materials of $81.20 with the cost of production rising to $83.70 when $2.50 in manufacturing expense is added, IHS said. Preliminary estimate shows Apple Watch Sport hardware costs only about 24 percent of MSRP; lowest of any Apple product examined by IHS There are several new features and manufacturing methods used in the Apple Watch Sport, including: a Pulse Oximeter, Force Touch sensor, \"Taptic Engine\" feedback, encapsulated modular printed circuit board (PCB) assembly and stacked-die integrated circuits (IC). “While these features have been promoted by Apple and none are necessarily revelatory,” Keller said. “It is noteworthy that many features are appearing for the first time – in combination – in one device. It could be a bellwether for other future Apple products.”Tesla’s Home Battery Announcement is a big deal: The coming revolution in energy storage: Late Thursday, the glitzy electric car company Tesla Motors, run by billionaire Elon Musk, ceased to be just a car company. As was widely expected, Tesla announced that it is offering a home battery product, which people can use to store energy from their solar panels or to backstop their homes against blackouts, and also larger scale versions that could perform similar roles for companies or even parts of the grid. Late Thursday, Tesla unveiled a suite of new battery products for homes, business, and even utility scale applications. The home product, dubbed the Tesla Powerwall, will store either 10 kilowatt-hours worth of energy (for $ 3,500) or 7 kilowatt-hours (for $3,000). Importantly, though, these costs do not include the cost of installing the battery or the cost of a power inverter, meaning that what a customer actually pays could be substantially more. The company says it will start to deliver the batteries in “late summer.” For those closely following developments in the energy storage space, there are two key details here that are worth considering — the cost of the battery itself, and what it would actually mean to have 10 kilowatt-hours of backup energy or energy storage in your home.When it comes to price, these numbers are hardly cheap, but they’re also lower than some analysts were suggesting — figures like $13,000 were common in press coverage prior to Tesla’s announcement. “The price points of the two Powerwall options for residential and small commercial segments will surely give minor jolts to the industry,” Ravi Manghani, an analyst with GTM Research, said in a statement. The prices are “slightly lower than what the world has come to expect of an expensive electric vehicle manufacturer. This announcement is expected to result in similarly aggressive price offers by other storage technology and system vendors.” So there are a lot of details about the energy storage future that need to be worked out, especially as the market continues to grow. But for today, Tesla definitely seems to have gotten people pretty excited.How mental illnesses help entrepreneurs thrive. Michael A. Freeman had long noticed that entrepreneurs seem inclined to have mental health issues. The clinical professor of psychology at UC-San Francisco’s medical school spent a decade at a company where his clients were the founders of businesses. He estimates that about a third of them seemed to have some type of mental health condition. He still notices the trend today in his work coaching executives. Freeman and California-Berkeley psychology professor Sheri Johnson decided to take a deeper look at the issue. They begun polling entrepreneurs and found a strong link between mental health conditions and entrepreneurship. “The people that we admire for being entrepreneurs seem to come from the same gene pool as the people who are kind of socially stigmatized because of mental health conditions,” Freeman said. “They must confer some adaptive advantage otherwise they wouldn’t be so highly represented in the population.” Forty-nine percent of entrepreneurs surveyed reported at least one mental health condition. Nearly a third reported having two or more mental health issues, such as ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety or substance use conditions. And half of the entrepreneurs who reported no mental-health conditions identified themselves as coming from families with a history of mental illness. This may seem counterintuitive. Why would an unstable person be most attracted and suited to launch a business? Freeman points out that there’s a beneficial side to these mental health conditions. Those weaknesses come with corresponding strengths that the average healthy person doesn’t have. For all of its ills, depression also brings empathy and creativity. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi attempted suicide as teenagers. Uncommon levels of empathy can allow a businessman to better understand a customer’s need. And a creative mind won’t be satisfied on the corporate ladder, but instead in a fast-moving start-up where he or she can unfurl ideas and dreams. Individuals with ADHD naturally make decisions faster, are comfortable working independently and are more creative, necessary skills at a start-up. They’re likely to be bored working for someone else.Rocket Internet-backed Foodpanda raises $100M led by Goldman Sachs: Foodpanda.com, a Rocket Internet-backed global, multi-location online food ordering marketplace (which operates under Hellofood brand in some markets), has raised $100 million funding led by global financial services giant Goldman Sachs, the company said. Existing investors including Rocket Internet also participated in the latest round. This round takes the total funding raised by Foodpanda to date to $310 million. Foodpanda will use the funding to expand its last-mile delivery operations and improve customer experience across 40 markets. The new investment comes barely two months after Rocket Internet led a $110 million funding round in the company. A few unnamed new investors also participated in that round. “We believe that Foodpanda has a tremendous opportunity to cement its emerging markets leadership position in the coming years. It is our expectation that the company’s innovative, value-added offerings will lead Foodpanda to be the winner in online food delivery within the markets in which it operates,” said Ian Friedman, vice president at Goldman Sachs Investment Partners. The company had raised $60 million from a group of investors, including existing investors Falcon Edge Capital and Rocket Internet last August. In February the same year, it had raised $20 million from Phenomen Ventures, a Russia-based venture capital firm, and a group of unnamed investors. Prior to that, Foodpanda had received $8 million in funding from iMena Holdings, an online consumer business group operating in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in September 2013. Before that, it had raised over $20 million from a group of investors that included Investment AB Kinnevik, a Sweden-based investment company, and Phenomen Ventures. Existing investor Rocket Internet also invested in the round. “The emerging markets represent the largest opportunity in online food delivery and we are committed to create the most convenient way for ordering and delivering food,” said Ralf Wenzel, co-founder and CEO of Foodpanda. Founded in April 2012, Foodpanda features location-specific listing of restaurants on its site. Users can check out menus, along with special offers, post that they can order and get food delivered to their homes. One can also search for restaurants according to cuisine, and/or by other parameters such as vegetarian/non- vegetarian, healthy food, etc. According to the company, it has partnered with over 45,000 restaurants in 40 countries globally. Foodpanda had acquired two key rivals in India over the past few months—Just Eat India and TastyKhana—to cement its position as the top player in the business in the country. It is now facing a bunch of competitors with restaurant review site Zomato starting online food ordering and new VC-backed startups like TinyOwl among others. Recently it started its own food logistics business with last mile delivery from restaurants to the consumers who order online through its site. Earlier, Foodpanda was just an online ordering platform.Apple, IBM and Japan Post See Profit in the Old-Age Market: Japan is an incubator of aging. More than other country, it is a graying nation. Twenty-five percent of its population, or 33 million people, are age 65 or older, more than double the global average. IBM, Apple and Japan Post Group, a giant postal service, bank and insurer, declared on Thursday that they were joining to deliver a new technology service to the fast-growing market of older Japanese adults. The service involves equipping Japan’s silver generation with iPads loaded with software apps to help them communicate with family and friends, monitor their health, and buy goods and services. For IBM and Apple, the initiative is another step in the partnership they formed last year, mainly to create mobile apps for corporate workers. The project with Japan Post goes beyond the workplace into homes. Quality-of-life services for aging populations will certainly be a big, if broad and diverse, marketplace. And Japan is a prime test bed. Citing the nation’s geriatric demographics, Taizo Nishimuro, chief executive of Japan Post, said, “Many countries will be facing the same issue soon.”Leaked Lyft Document Reveals a Costly Battle With Uber: Behind the friendly pink mustaches and fist bumps, Lyft is spending furiously to maintain second place in the U.S. ride-sharing industry, and steal market share from the distant leader, Uber Technologies. The expensive battle plan helped Lyft claim a fourfold increase in active passengers on 2.2 million rides in December 2014, but growth is beginning to slow, according to a company presentation to investors that was obtained by Bloomberg. Lyft estimates $130 million in revenue for 2014, according to the document.The presentation offers a revealing look inside a company that's sweeping U.S. cities, and attracting the attention of venture capitalists and regulators. The presentation, compiled for its $530 million fundraising round announced on March 12, includes recent and projected revenue, ridership figures, marketing costs, and other data about the business. Lyft and Uber aren't publicly traded, and neither company discloses financial information about its operations. Lyft and Uber declined to comment In addition to providing a window into its business, Lyft had some choice words for its chief rival. The presentation describes Uber as a \"top-down model,\" with an \"exclusive mentality\" and \"anti-social culture.\" While the 40-page document does not detail Lyft's operating expenses or losses, it does illustrate the mounting costs of marketing the service. Lyft estimates that the company spends a combined $530 on marketing to each driver and 22 passengers in San Francisco, and it takes about nine months to recoup those costs through its Lyft Classic service—not to be confused with the carpooling option, Lyft Line. The company expects to spend 60.5 percent of its revenue on marketing in December 2015, the document says. A ride booked in San Francisco through the Classic service generates a 92-cent profit for Lyft, including marketing costs but excluding corporate expenses, such as software developers and office space. Lyft co-founder John Zimmer told Bloomberg in January that the company is profitable in San Francisco and its other most established markets. The $130 million in revenue for 2014 is based on the combined net revenue from Lyft Classic and gross revenue from Lyft Line during the month of December, which implies $10.8 million in revenue during that month. Using the same calculation, Lyft reports revenue of $12 million in 2013. (Tallying gross revenue from Lyft Line, which includes money paid out to drivers, has the potential to significantly distort the company's 2014 revenue and growth, as well as projections, because the service didn't exist in 2013. However, the document says it does so for the purposes of generally accepted accounting principles.) Lyft projects $796 million for 2015, a slowdown in growth but still an impressive 512 percent jump from 2014. In the interview from January, Zimmer said the company's revenue and rides rose fivefold last year. Despite ride-sharing companies' attempts to guard financial details, Uber has faced similar leaks. The company generated $22 million in revenue during a one-week period in November 2013, according to an internal dashboard posted to the blog Valleywag. Uber drivers were completing more than 100,000 trips per week in each of its largest cities, and San Francisco had about 70,000 active users a week in December 2013, according to a separate report in Business Insider. Uber said on Jan. 22 that it has more than 160,000 active drivers in the U.S. who give more than a million rides a day. Lyft has seen similarly staggering growth in the number of drivers and riders using the service. In December 2012, Lyft had 400 drivers giving 40,000 rides a month; by 2013, it had 7,000 drivers and 488,000 rides a month; in 2014, it was 51,000 drivers and 2.2 million monthly rides, according to the document. The number of people booking rides through the app each month rose from 9,000 in 2012 to 631,000 last year. Though currently unprofitable, Lyft's ride economics appear to be going in the right direction. The company increased its share of each fare from 6.7 percent in July 2014 to 25.7 percent in December, the document says. The increase is expected to be less dramatic this year, reaching 26.2 percent in December 2015, according to the company's forecast. The investor presentation also touts its progress with city officials, citing 28 new regulations in six states last year. The document illustrates Lyft's obsession with quick pickups. In San Francisco, the time between a ride request and the car's arrival in December 2014 was 2.62 minutes, an improvement from 3.1 minutes in August. The average time in all of Lyft's markets fell to 3.9 minutes from 4.18 minutes during the same period. It seems the war with Uber could be measured in seconds.Paytm’s big day: IRCTC adds Paytm wallet as a payment option: Government-owned railway ticketing platform IRCTC, which is the one of the most used internet commerce site in the country clocking on an average over half a million tickets a day, has added Paytm’s wallet as an online payment option. IRCTC, the primary seller of railway tickets online (others OTAs act as secondary link) in the country, has been offering various online payments options besides the conventional credit/debit cards and net banking. It allows payments through cash cards, its own co-branded pre-paid Rupay card with Union Bank and with Paytm wallet it adds another payment option. Last we checked the Paytm payment option was integrated on IRCTC’s web portal but was not yet available on its mobile app on Android. The development means a big move for Paytm as it is already available as an alternate payment option in several key internet ventures such as the country’s top online food ordering venture Foodpanda, cab hailing app Uber (in India), eBay and Jabong. Although IRCTC has come a long way in terms of streamlining online payment process on its site, given the huge load on its servers it is not uncommon to see payment failures in a multi-authentication process which comes with a credit and debit cards. Paytm wallet would look to capitalise in partly solving this pain point for users and hopes to also expand its reach in tier-II and tier-III markets, where trains are a primary mode of long distance travel and IRCTC by default is the booking platform.This too shall pass: Secret Shuts Down: Anonymous sharing app Secret will shut down soon, according to sources close to the company. The announcement could be made as soon as today or tomorrow, and there’s some talk of current employees receiving modest severance packages. Having raised $35 million, it’s unlikely that the company is out of money. But after a major redesign sterilized the app’s identity and made it look just like its much more popular competitor Yik Yak, and its co-founder Chrys Bader-Wechseler left, Secret may see shutting down as the best outcome. Many employees, including top talent like Sarah Haider, Safeer Jiwan, and Amol Jain have left the company over the past month or so. One source says the company has been whittled down to under 10 employees from over 20 several months ago and has been in “maintenance mode.” More here: Secret’s trajectory illustrates the flash-in-the-pan nature of Silicon Valley’s current technology boom. Even as a handful of start-ups rise to stratospheric valuations and take in billions of dollars in financing, other privately held companies cannot sustain their following. Fab.com, a onetime e-commerce darling, was once valued at more than $1 billion and had raised more than $150 million before ending up in a fire sale this year, when it was bought for about $15 million. Other start-ups are dealing with a cooling-off process as big companies muscle in on their turf. Meerkat, a live-streaming video app that gained great traction early this year, is now grappling with the entrance of Twitter and its Periscope live-video app, for example. Microsoft might be approaching a substantial goodwill impairment from the Nokia purchase: Microsoft made waves recently by disclosing in its quarterly 10-Q document that its Phone business, which generates billions in yearly revenue, isn’t performing as well as it expected. As Microsoft is carrying billions of dollars of goodwill related to the Nokia purchase on its books, the warning landed like a brick in a puddle of lukewarm slop. History as prelude in this case is the aQuantive boondoggle, during which Microsoft wrote of billions of dollars of value relating to that purchase. As Business Insider’s Matt Weinberger recently wrote: “[T]he last time Microsoft used language like this in an earnings report was back in 2012, three months before it took a $6.2 billion charge to its bottom line for its aQuantive acquisition.” Microsoft currently counts quite a lot of goodwill as an intangible asset on its books. In its most recent quarters, the dollar amount of goodwill sourced from the Nokia deal, in which Microsoft bought the majority of the Finnish company’s hardware assets, sat around the $5.4 billion mark. That’s about a quarter of the company’s total goodwill, which it reports as just over $21.7 billion. Microsoft may not be forced to write down any goodwill relating to the Nokia deal. Or it may have to write down quite a lot. In terms of scale, how bad could the damage be? A massive write down could tank a quarter of the company’s profit, using normal accounting methods (GAAP). Using adjusted metrics, Microsoft could take the non-cash charge in stride, more shamefaced than materially castigated. On a GAAP basis, things get more interesting. The $5.4 billion in goodwill that the company currently counts as an asset is more than the company’s last-quarter GAAP profit. So, in theory, a massive write down could erase a full quarter’s profits both per-share and in aggregate. We can look back to the aQuantive write down to see the potential impact. Here’s Microsoft, from the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2012. In short, the write down essentially erased the company’s profit for the quarter.In sharp reversal, US retailer Best Buy will start accepting Apple Pay in all stores: Best Buy announced on Monday that it now accepts Apple Pay payments for purchases made inside its smartphone app, and by the end of the year will accept payments made in its brick-and-mortar stores using the Apple Pay mobile wallet. A Best Buy spokesman said in a statement that the electronics retailer wanted to give customers as many options as possible in how they pay for goods and services. The company also plans to open a technology innovation office in the Seattle area to work on mobile technology issues, the spokesman said. That is a sharp reversal from just a few months ago, when major retailers like Rite-Aid and CVS abruptly shut off the ability to accept Apple Pay payments in their retail stores. Best Buy has not accepted Apple Pay payments in the past. The issue was not whether these companies want a mobile wallet to catch on. More than 50 retailers, including Walmart, Best Buy and Gap, started working together years ago to develop CurrentC, a smartphone-based payments product still in development. The hope was that for members of the consortium, also called the Merchant Customer Exchange or MCX, accepting mobile payments through their CurrentC app could be a way to help retailers understand more about their customers’ shopping habits and, potentially, let merchants avoid the high fees they pay when processing credit card transactions. However, when Apple Pay made its debut, MCX retail partners were contractually bound not to accept alternative mobile wallet payments, according to two retailers involved in MCX, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details of the partnership are private. That meant that even though the CurrentC product is still unreleased, partner retailers would not be able to take Apple Pay or Google Wallet transactions. Some of those exclusivity agreements will expire soon, people close to the coalition said, which could explain why Best Buy will accept Apple Pay in stores this year.PremjiInvest may lead $50M fresh investment in grocery e-tailer BigBasket. PremjiInvest, the private investment arm of Wipro Ltd chairman Azim Premji, is in discussions to lead a $50 million (Rs 312 crore) Series C investment round in Bangalore-based SuperMarket Grocery Supplies, which owns and operates online groceries marketplace – BigBasket.com, sources told Techcircle.in. According to senior investment bankers who are aware of the discussions, this fresh round of funding is expected to be wrapped within three months. Request for views on the development from the management of BigBasket and PremjiInvest did not elicit any response. This comes within seven months of BigBasket raising Rs 200 crore ($32.9 million) in its Series B round of funding from a clutch of investors including Helion Venture Partners and Mumbai-based Zodius Capital. After establishing its presence in its home market Bangalore, it has expanded into Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai. It is expected to enter Delhi soon. The firm still has cash from the last round but would need a larger stash not just to enter new markets but to create a war-chest to fight fresh competitors, including some which follow an asset-light hyper-local grocery delivery marketplace. In the grocery e-commerce space ZopNow raised $10 million from Dragoneer Investment Group with participation from the existing investors Accel Partners, Qualcomm Ventures and Times Internet. ZopNow, which earlier competed head on with BigBasket, has pivoted to become an asset-light business and partners with offline hypermarket chain HyperCity to pick products and deliver to consumers who order online. Then there are a bunch of delivery startups which essentially connects users to local grocers. Grofers raised $45 million across two rounds since January this year; PepperTap raised $10 million while LocalBanya also got fresh funding. BigBasket is understood to have closed FY15 with a top-line of Rs 250 crore, with a run-rate of 6,000 orders a day with average billing of Rs 1,500 per customer. It had generated sales of around Rs 70 crore in the year ended March 31, 2014, according to VCCEdge, the data research platform of VCCircle.Indonesian startup Cubeacon aims to be pioneer in iBeacon technology: Cubeacon wants to be Indonesia’s pioneer in iBeacon technology: It’s a rare thing to hear about software-as-a-service (SaaS) ventures from Indonesia, and even more rare to hear about hardware innovation. But Cubeacon combines both. It focuses on customer loyalty management with a hardware component based on Apple’s iBeacon technology. The startup may be so far ahead of the curve in Indonesia that its CEO Tiyo Avianto is focusing Cubeacon’s distribution in the Japanese market for the time being. Cubeacon uses a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) sensor that was introduced by Apple under the name of iBeacon in 2013. iBeacon sensors are made to be placed indoors, for instance inside a shop. These sensors can detect a customer’s position within the shop very precisely, and they can send offers or information relevant to that location directly to a customer’s phone (so long as they have Bluetooth turned on). Potentially, hundreds of sensor units can be installed across one location. Along with its sensor units, which Cubeacon calls a Cubeacon Box, the company delivers customizable software which shop owners can configure depending on their context and requirements, for example to receive analytics and maps, and to deliver custom ads, or push notifications. “At this time we can produce about 2,500 Cubeacon units per month,” Avianto says. Cubeacon hopes to tap into the big budgets that major companies have at hand for their customer loyalty programs. “Cubeacon exists to bring a different experience to customer loyalty,” he says. Cubeacon’s revenue is based on hardware unit sales, but it also charges for its software on a subscription-based model. For large companies, Cubeacon’s software can be white labelled, meaning that it can be branded and adapted to suit the firm’s needs. It even allows the integration of other iBeacon-based devices, which makes the software attractive for developer companies who are already experts in the technology.Apple is raising prices, and still managing to sell more units. Apple is pulling off a feat almost unheard of in the history of consumer electronics – as more competitors offer rival products for less, Apple is raising prices and still selling more gadgets. The latest report from the International Data Corporation estimates that Apple held nearly 20 percent of the world’s smartphone market at the end of 2014, an increase from 17.5 percent the previous year. It largely took those sales away from Android-based smartphones, which declined by about the same amount over that periodUS data center consolidation continues: Telx Group Inc, a private equity-owned provider of data centers and network solutions to companies, is exploring a sale that could value it at around $2 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S. businesses' burgeoning demand for data and video is fueling a revival in fiber optic services and data centers. New York-based Telx manages 1.3 million square feet of data center space and more than 50,000 network connections. The company owns 20 data centers, including three major ones in New York City. Its customers range from small businesses that only need half of a cabinet in data centers to global companies requiring a full-floor lease. Telx is just the latest data center company to hit the auction block. Zayo Group Holdings ZAYO.O bought data center company Latysis in February for $675 million, while AT&T has been pursuing a sale of its data centers worth $2 billion. Earlier on Monday, Lightower Fiber Networks, a fiber company that is also owned by Berkshire Partners and ABRY partners, bought Fibertech Networks from Court Square Networks for $1.9 billion.Alibaba-backed Paytm pushes deeper into e-commerce, adds mobile marketplace app for e-merchants: Paytm, an Indian online payments platform backed by China’s Alibaba, is pushing deeper into India’s booming e-commerce industry with a zero-commission mobile app marketplace targeted at small and medium-sized firms, the mainstay of the country’s economy. The company said on Friday this push, in addition to its existing general e-commerce platform, would help marketplace operations make up half of its total revenue target of $4 billion by the end of 2015. “This is our move into mobile commerce,” said Paytm Chief Executive Vijay Shekhar Sharma, adding the mobile app was designed to connect small businesses and consumers. Even though only about a quarter of the population can access the Internet, India already has the world’s third-largest population of internet users, thanks to cheap smartphones. That has driven a boom in e-commerce, in a country that had previously shopped largely in informal stalls and bazaars. Paytm, which has yet to turn a profit, will not charge merchants commission on their sales, making money instead on commissions levied when they transfer money earned out of the site. Paytm expects to have 100,000 merchants on its app by the end of the year, up from about 33,000 today on their general web platform. It expects to grow the number of stock-keeping units — essentially, units sold — from 8.5 million today to 100 million by the end of the year.Ratan Tata buys a stake in Xiaomi, will also act as advisor (more here) Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of the holding company of India's Tata conglomerate, has acquired a stake in Xiaomi Technology [XTC.UL], a deal that is likely to bolster the Chinese phone maker's presence in the world's third-largest smartphone market. Financial details of the unspecified stake bought by Tata in Xiaomi, the first by an Indian, were not disclosed in the statement issued by the Chinese company on Sunday. Xiaomi, the No. 3 global smartphone maker, was valued at $45 billion after a December funding round. Tata, a respected business leader who was the chairman of salt-to-software Tata Sons for more than two decades, has previously invested in Indian start-ups, including online retailer Snapdeal. Tata'a investment in Xiaomi comes against the backdrop of an aggressive push by Xiaomi in India after entering the market, which has huge growth potential with just one in 10 people using smartphones, in July 2014. On Thursday, Xiaomi hosted its first global launch outside of China in the Indian capital New Delhi, unveiling its feature-heavy Mi 4i model that supports six Indian languages at 12,999 rupees ($205). Xiaomi and other Chinese smartphone makers are drafting in cricket teams and Bollywood stars to conquer India, their largest overseas market and a key testing ground for their international expansion. \"Mr. Tata is one of the most well-respected business leaders in the world. An investment by him is an affirmation of the strategy we have undertaken in India so far,\" Lei Jun, founder and chief executive officer of Xiaomi said in the statement. \"We are looking forward to bringing more products into India,\" he said.Alibaba, China Telecom tie up to sell cheap smartphones in China's smaller cities: Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and state-owned China Telecom Corp Ltd have tied up to sell inexpensive smartphones aimed at boosting mobile commerce in smaller cities and rural areas. The phones, dubbed \"Tianyi Taobao Shopping Handsets\", will come installed with either an app for easy access to Alibaba's flagship Taobao online shopping platform or its home-grown YunOS mobile operating system, it said in a statement late on Friday. Buyers will be eligible for four months of free 2G data service. The partnership is a bid to deepen Alibaba's e-commerce base in less developed parts of the country and promote its mobile operating system in a shrinking, cut-throat handset market. Six models produced by Coolpad, Hisense and TCL would come with the Mobile Taobao app pre-installed. Mobile Taobao is China's most popular mobile shopping app with more than 200 million monthly active users, it said. Another eight models, made by lesser-known brands including Uniscope, Ctyon and Kingsun, will run YunOS, providing buyers with an Alibaba account for shopping and cloud-based storage, and other preloaded services, it said.GE is installing sensors into L.E.D streetlights so that city can collect data: Earlier this month, General Electric announced it was selling GE Capital, its financial arm. With less fanfare, G.E. also unveiled plans for computer-connected L.E.D. streetlights, so cities can collect and analyze performance data, for lower costs and better safety. GE Capital was a huge profit center after the financial deregulation of the 1980s, but that was then. Sensor-rich lights, to be found eventually in offices and homes, are for a company that will sell knowledge of behavior as much as physical objects. “The next generation of bulbs have a life cycle of 20 years; we can’t think of that as a transactional business anymore,” said Bill Ruh, the head of G.E.’s software center. “We can put cameras and more sensors on these, and measure motion, heat, air quality.” Retailers might want such lights to steer shoppers, he said, while consumers could better learn about their electricity consumption. This sensor explosion is only starting: Huawei, a Chinese maker of computing and communications equipment with $47 billion in revenue, estimates that by 2025 over 100 billion things, including smartphones, vehicles, appliances and industrial equipment, will be connected to cloud computing systems. The Internet will be almost fused with the physical world. America's car market is being disrupted by online retailers: To say that Beepi is disruptive, in this age of disruptions, sounds clichéd. Yet after just a year of operation in California, Beepi is now buying and selling hundreds of cars a month and is on track to book revenue of $100 million over the next year, the company said. The start-up has raised nearly $80 million in financing and it plans to expand to seven additional regions nationwide by the end of the year. Beepi’s rapid growth illustrates something deeper about the role the digital world keeps playing in our lives: There’s no limit to it. A few years ago, it seemed reasonable to assume there were some sectors of the economy that would resist the pull of the Internet and which most people felt were better left offline. Shopping for groceries or eyeglasses, say; now both those tasks are moving online. Beepi and similar competitors, including Carlypso and Carvana, are pushing people to cross another threshold on the way toward a digital-only life. Although auto experts doubt that online-only car-buying experiences will become the norm, it would be wise not to discount their rise, for the simple reason that the Internet remains hungry. As people grow more accustomed to doing pretty much everything over computers and phones, the Internet tends to consume everything in its path. When Mr. Resnik began investigating the auto sales industry, he found that more than 90 percent of American car buyers consulted the Internet for purchases and a rising number of people worldwide say they would buy a car entirely online. According to a study by the research firm Capgemini, about a third of Americans and two-thirds of Chinese who were asked said they would buy a car over the web. To Mr. Resnik, the latent consumer interest was a starting point, and along with a friend, Owen Savir, he set out to create a system to bring to car shopping all the conveniences we’ve grown used to with other online purchases. “We just thought that the car market was broken,” Mr. Resnik said. At the core of Beepi’s business model is a pricing trick. There are three relevant prices for any used car. The trade-in price, which is what a dealer will give you for your car; the private sales price, which is what you can get if you sold it directly to someone else; and the retail price, which is the price the car will command at a dealership. Dealers pay the trade-in price for vehicles and then sell them at the retail price. On some cars, that spread can be worth 50 percent. Beepi thinks it can make a profit while operating within a tighter pricing band. When you list your car with the site, the company’s pricing algorithm, which consults data on historical car sales in your area, offers a price at least $1,000 more than you can get by trading in your car at the dealer. That is still less than what you would get selling privately, but Beepi’s price is guaranteed. If your car doesn’t sell within 30 days of listing on Beepi, the company will buy it from you. On the other side of the transaction, Beepi sells cars at prices lower than comparable certified used cars at dealerships. It can do so, the founder says, because its overhead is lower — it doesn’t have to maintain parking lots to house cars, because the vehicles stay with the sellers until they are sold. Also, because it buys and sells cars over a wide area — currently, any city in California and Arizona — it can take advantage of supply and demand disparities in different regions. Finally, Beepi caps its own fee at 9 percent, depending on price and demand (it will take as little as 1 percent). “When you put it together, we think you can give more to sellers, more to buyers, and make up to 9 percent of the price,” Mr. Resnik said. But if Beepi is faster, more convenient, and a better financial deal than the traditional car market, it also suffers one huge downside. Beepi does not let buyers test-drive cars before buying. Instead, it takes a page from other online retailers’ return policies. Like a pair of shoes from Zappos, Beepi’s cars come with a 10-day, try-it-out money-back guarantee. If you aren’t satisfied, the company will send a truck to take the car away free. The company positions this as better than a dealer’s test-drive. “It’s a 10-day test drive,” Mr. Savir said. But that could be a tough sell. Mr. Resnik of Beepi said  only a handful of people have returned their cars, at a rate “much, much lower than 1 percent.” And he isn’t worried that there won’t be consumer demand in buying cars without a test-drive. “As people buy more and more online, they’re getting used to it,” he said. “It’s going to happen.”\"Apple Won’t Always Rule. Just Look at IBM\" In a few short years, Apple has become the biggest company on the planet by market value — so big that it dwarfs every other one on the stock market. It dominates the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index as no other company has in 30 years. Apple’s market capitalization — the value of all of the shares of its stock — is more than $758 billion, greater than any other company’s. Yet the Wall Street consensus is that Apple is still having a growth spurt. In fact, if Apple’s watches, phones, laptops and other gadgets and services keep generating favorable publicity — and if its quarterly earnings report on Monday is as strong as the market expects it to be — there’s a reasonable chance that Apple’s value will keep swelling. Not far down the road, it might even reach the $1 trillion level that some hedge funds predict. But even if Apple still has some room to run, there are some early warning signs. After all, the company has already crossed a significant threshold. In February, it grew to twice the size of the next biggest company in the S.&P. 500, a rare feat of financial dominance, and one that hasn’t happened since Ronald Reagan was president. I checked the numbers with Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. He found that the last market colossus to tower over its competitors by a two-to-one ratio was IBM, which did it in three successive years: 1983, 1984 and 1985. “That was when PCs were new,” he said, “and just about everyone thought IBM would rule the world.” Now it’s Apple’s world. Apple is the most widely held stock in American mutual fund portfolios. IBM, the former undisputed heavyweight champion, isn’t even in the running anymore. It ranks 62nd, according to a Morningstar analysis performed at my request. IBM is still an important company, but it is struggling. Investors judge it to be worth less than one-quarter of Apple’s market value today. What happened to IBM — how it became this small, in comparison with Apple — is worth remembering. IBM thrived for years afterward, but just as Jobs had predicted, it turned out to be vulnerable to disruptive change, as all big companies are. For decades now, IBM has engaged in a sometimes painful transition, and as it revealed in its quarterly earnings report last week, it is still hurting: Its revenues have declined and it has endured wrenching business shifts. My colleague Steve Lohr wrote last week that IBM has been getting out of slow-growing old businesses, like personal computers, disk drives, low-end server computers and chip manufacturing — but its new initiatives in fields like data analytics, cloud computing and mobile apps for corporate customers haven’t entirely succeeded yet. In a turnabout, IBM’s mobile app strategy relies on a partnership with the current giant, its old nemesis Apple. IBM is leveraging its prowess with supercomputers and artificial intelligence with a new initiative, Watson Health, that includes Apple. That alliance could help both companies grow — in Apple’s case, by ensuring that its products work more seamlessly in corporate environments where IBM is deeply entrenched. Rapid growth, after all, isn’t a sure thing, especially when you’re already the biggest company in the world. IBM has proved that. Sooner or later, Apple investors will have to take that lesson to heart.With Mi 4i Smartphone, Xiaomi Turns to India: For those who think the West is the center of the tech world, Xiaomi has a different opinion. The upstart Chinese maker of smartphones just hosted its biggest event outside of its home country to introduce a new flagship phone, and it wasn’t in the United States or even Europe, it was in India. The phone, the Mi 4i, was introduced on Thursday by Hugo Barra, a former Google executive. The phone includes impressive specs and special features in India — like extra language options — and will go on sale April 30 in India, and in May in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. As the company’s Lei Jun, Xiaomi’s chief executive, normally does in China, Mr. Barra guided an enthusiastic audience through the phone’s range of features. But for all the attention Xiaomi gives to technical details and its operating system, the denouement came when Mr. Barra announced the price of the phone: 12,999 rupees, or roughly $200, a low price for a flagship device. While there are a huge number of reasons for Xiaomi, valued at $45 billion after its latest December fund-raising round, not to push into markets like the United States — from potential patent lawsuits to having to develop relationships with carriers — perhaps the primary reason Xiaomi is entering India is because the country looks quite a bit like China several years ago. Most importantly, Indians are expected to buy far more smartphones this year than they did in 2014, according to IDC, the research firm. IDC estimates that the country will buy 111 million smartphones this year and 149 million units in 2016. India is expected to outpace the United States in sales in the coming years. Yet the $200 price point makes the Mi 4i far cheaper than the leading phones from other companies like Samsung, HTC and Motorola. Even so, in India, the Xiaomi phone still ranks as expensive, about double the price of the cheap mainstays of companies like Micromax.Quikr valued around $890M in latest funding round: Classifieds site Quikr, which raised $150 million in fresh funding from existing investors besides a new investor Steadview Capital Management, was valued at around $892 million, as per a note by its Swedish investor Investment AB Kinnevik. Kinnevik said its own stake had an implied value of $158 million and the fair value of ownership of its holding is $93.2 million which gives a fair value of around $517 million to Quikr. Kinnevik had also participated in the latest round with an infusion of $40 million as part of a larger $150 million funding early this month. It also saw participation from other existing investor Tiger Global. With the September deal, the total capital raised by Quikr stood at around $350 million. The latest funding comes barely seven months after it raised $60 million in a fresh round of funding led by Tiger Global with participation from its existing investors, including Matrix Partners India, Nokia Growth Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, Omidyar Network, Warburg Pincus and eBay Inc, besides Kinnevik. In the last disclosure, Kinnevik had pegged a fair value of Quikr at around $340 million. Founded in 2008 by Chulet and Jiby Thomas (who quit the firm later), Quikr was originally started as Kijiji India. The firm later rebranded to Quikr. It is a large scale cross-category classifieds business with over 30 million consumers. These consumers come to Quikr to sell, buy, rent or find products and services in a variety of categories such as electronics and household goods, real estate, cars, bikes, jobs and services. The firm claims that small businesses across 1,000 cities are using the site. It recently announced the launch of a new classifieds website for real estate called quikrhomes.com to allow B2C as well as C2C discovery of properties up for sale as well as those available for rent. It is also launching separate verticals and new sites with separate URLs for around half a dozen areas. Early this year, Quikr launched Nxt, an instant messaging service to enable buyers and sellers to interact with greater convenience and privacy.Zomato embeds Uber button to its own app for hailing cabs to reach restaurants in 13 countries: Zomato.com, owned and operated by Gurgaon-based Zomato Media Pvt Ltd, has entered into a partnership with Uber Technologies Inc (Uber) to enable users to book cabs to the restaurant they are planning to eat at, right from its own app. The feature has gone live for Zomato users in London and South Africa, and will now be rolled out to users in other key markets. The partnership would cover Zomato users in 27 cities across 13 countries where both the firms have a presence – India, Australia, Canada, the UK, South Africa, Indonesia, New Zealand, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Turkey, UAE and the US. “This partnership makes eating out more convenient with the Zomato app connecting to Uber services seamlessly,” said Pankaj Chaddah, co-founder and COO, Zomato. “Through this API integration, Zomato users in 13 countries will now be able to reach those hidden gems in their cities seamlessly and in style,” said Eric Alexander, head of business, Asia, Uber. How it works:Once a user has found a place to dine at or have drinks at using the Zomato app, a single tap on the Uber button on the restaurant page will allow him/her to find the nearest Uber cab. In addition to seeing the estimated fare and how long it will take for the Uber to arrive, one will also be able to choose the Uber service that best suits one’s need.Details on Alibaba's Cloud: After keeping the world waiting for nine years, Amazon finally broke out earnings for its Amazon Web Services on Thursday. The $1.57 billion in sales for the quarter suggest that the company is far ahead of rivals in the cloud computing business. But as AWS expands globally, it faces strong competition from a familiar foe: Alibaba. Amazon already has 28 percent of the worldwide market for cloud infrastructure services, followed by Microsoft with 10 percent, according to a report by Synergy Research Group. To expand its share, Amazon has spent the past few years plunking down gigantic data centers around the globe to help it quickly serve customers outside the U.S. In some cases, it did so to abide by local regulations as to where these servers should be located. Unlike many of its rivals, Amazon has targeted China, opening a data center near Beijing in 2014. Alibaba opened its first overseas data center in Silicon Valley in March to help provide cloud computing services to Chinese customers, Yu says. At the time, Alibaba said it served a 22.8 percent market share of the Chinese infrastructure-as-a-service market in the first half of 2014. It currently has five data center hubs in Asia: Beijing, Hangzhou, Qingdao, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen. Like Amazon, Alibaba has a strategic partnership with Intel to do custom chips. Unlike Amazon, it has been more public about its experimentation with low-power server processors based on designs from ARM Holdings. Alibaba joined a cross-industry engineering organization named Linaro in April to develop software to get the most out of new chip designs from ARM. The company is looking at ARM closely, says Yu, and will have more details to share next year. By adopting a non-standard processor architecture, Alibaba would be able to save money on its mammoth electricity bills by tailoring its chips to its software. In doing so, it would join a small club of companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, with the scale and engineering talent needed to make such a move.  Aliyun has more than 1,200 employees, 80 percent of whom are engineers, says Yu. The company began looking at doing heavy engineering on hardware and software about 10 years ago, predating the formation of its cloud.  As is typical of large Chinese technology companies, Alibaba is woven into China's bureaucracy. The company currently has strategic agreements with 12 Chinese provinces, regions, and municipalities, as well as an undisclosed number of government agencies, including the China Central Government Procurement Agency. That guarantees it a lot of business in China and ensures that its infrastructure is stress-tested in the same way that large clouds from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are. This helps to make its service more resilient.As Amazon parties on, some large fund managers take their leave: For many years, investors have been very tolerant as Amazon.com has sacrificed profits for rapid growth in sales and as it built new businesses. That patience may finally be wearing thin. The average large-cap fund that holds Amazon has 1.4 percent of its assets in the stock, down 23 percent from this time last year, according to the latest available Lipper data. There are 116 funds with more than $1 billion under management that have either reduced or sold all of their holdings in the Internet retailer over the past 12 months. They include such well-known names as Fidelity Contrafund, Washington Mutual Investors Fund, Touchstone Sands Select Growth fund and the T. Rowe Price Growth fund. Some investors and analysts said that such a drop in fund ownership - in a period when Amazon's shares have been climbing - suggests that large-cap managers increasingly see the company as over-valued, particularly at a time when it is spending tons of cash branching off into everything from selling its own smartphone to producing a Woody Allen TV series. What strikes some investors as different this time around is the widening divergence between Amazon's valuation and that of its large technology peers like Apple Inc and Google Inc, both of which are growing at similar rates. Amazon trades at 16.2 times its book value. Apple, by comparison, trades at 6.5 times its book value, according to Thomson Reuters data. Google, another company which has expanded beyond its core business into lines as far afield as driverless cars, is valued at 3.4 times its book value. The others made big profits last year while Amazon was unprofitable. While Google has posted more than $68 billion in profits before taxes between 2010-2014, Amazon has netted just $2.6 billion over the same time frame, according to Thomson Reuters data. The cashflow is a better gauge of how the company is doing, according to Robert S. Peck, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, who downgraded the company to \"neutral\" on March 9 because he views the shares as overvalued. He estimates its free cash flow from operations will climb to $8.9 billion this fiscal year from $3.4 billion in 2010, yet nearly all of that additional cash is being used to expand into businesses like grocery delivery or web services.Start-Up Blends Old-Fashioned Matchmaking and Algorithms: Dating Ring uses an algorithm to generate potential matches and then a matchmaker combs through those to hand-select dates. The company’s hybrid model represents the tip of a backlash against mobile dating apps like Tinder, where matches are based almost solely on appearance. Mark Brooks, an Internet dating analyst and consultant, said although there is still plenty of interest in online dating, “People also want relationships that begin based on more than your gut reaction to a photo,” he said. “This model is very new, this merging of Internet dating and matchmakers.” Several new start-ups, like SparkStarter, Hinge and Coffee Meets Bagel, don’t use matchmakers per se but do use connections — friends and friends of friends on Facebook — to humanize the process and move beyond algorithmic matching. Dave Evans, the founder of Digicraft, an online dating consultancy, said, “The whole industry now is built on smoke, mirrors and a lot of marketing. We’re at the point where I don’t care how old you are, what you find interesting, even where you live. I’m just going to swipe left or right based on how you look.” Melissa Brady, a 37-year-old Dating Ring client in White Plains, N.Y., loves the idea of a matchmaker being involved. “It makes me more excited to go on the date, because I have more hope for it,” she said. Ms. Brady has used other dating sites, including OKCupid and Coffee Meets Bagel, but found those dates less well-suited to her. A key part of Dating Ring’s model is user feedback — given to the matchmaker after every date — which is then used to keep improving a dater’s experience. The matchmakers are all women who work at least 10 hours a week and want a flexible schedule. The company has begun operating in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston. Dating Ring charges $240 for three months with one introduction each week; anyone can become a member of the database free and be eligible for matches with paying clients. The company’s V.I.P. service includes a one-hour, in-person consultation and multiple Skype feedback sessions in a package tailored to the client. The average price for a V.I.P. package is $3,500 and for that, a client gets five dates in five months. Ms. Kay and Ms. Tessler have also begun setting up speed-dating events for members in New York and San Francisco. “They sold out within two days,” Ms. Kay said. Revenue now averages about $35,000 a month but growth fluctuates, Ms. Kay said. “Some months it’s 50 percent and other months it’s 5 percent,” she says. “Right now, we’re pretty much breaking even.” The company received a $100,000 initial investment from Y Combinator and raised an additional $255,000 from angels.Shyp, an On-Demand Mailing Service, Raises $50 Million: Shyp, a company that lets customers summon workers to quickly pick up, pack and ship parcels, said on Tuesday that it has raised $50 million in venture capital, the largest funding round in the start-up’s history. The new round values Shyp at just above $250 million, according to two people with knowledge of the financial terms, who requested anonymity because the deal talks were private. A Shyp spokesman declined to comment on the company’s valuation. The funding is another significant bet on the future of on-demand start-ups by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the storied venture capital firm that led Shyp’s new financing round and that recently won a case against a former partner who alleged gender bias at the firm. With the round, which also includes participation by previous investors Homebrew and SherpaVentures, John Doerr, a Kleiner executive, will join the board of directors at Shyp. Kleiner has also put money in to other on-demand companies like Uber and DoorDash. Uber, the on-demand ride-hailing service, has also dabbled in the business of moving goods from one place to another, signaling its ambitions to become a way to transport anything and everything to different places around the world. Shyp, on the other hand, piggybacks on existing transportation networks like UPS, FedEx and the United States Postal Service. Instead of doing all of the shipping itself, Shyp hires contract workers to pick up items from customers, and pack and ship them, eliminating the hassle of standing in line at the post office or finding the proper packaging supplies to send the items. “We asked ourselves, what is the ideal way to ship something?” said Kevin Gibbon, chief executive of Shyp. “Can we scale this business to happen in multiple cities? Can we improve operations and logistics to make it cheaper and faster?” Mr. Gibbon said his service was complementary to the shipping networks already in place, as Shyp’s local logistics networks gather many packages together to hand them off to the actual companies doing the transportation, a task that he said would cost companies like DHL and FedEx much more in time, labor and resources to offer. Shyp makes a $5 service fee on each package it delivers. Shyp also announced it is opening up a pilot version of its service in Los Angeles; it currently operates in San Francisco, New York City and Miami.India's Central bank working on integration between e-commerce firms and banks: India's central bank is working on improving the integration between e-commerce firms and the country's banking systems, a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Monday. \"One area which we will now be looking at very closely, which is emerging, is how to provide integration between e-commerce platforms and banks,\" Deputy Governor H.R. Khan said at a banking industry event. India's fast growing e-commerce market is valued at about $12 billion, however most shoppers still pay for their online purchases through cash at the doorstep. Khan said the central bank is also considering relaxing its requirement for a two-step authentication process for small transactions to make online payments smoother.India Startup Action: Freshdesk - first Google Capital investee outside the US - raises $50M in Series E funding from Tiger Global, Accel & Google Capital: Chennai- and US-based Freshdesk Inc, a provider of SaaS-based customer support platform for enterprises, has raised $50 million (Rs 314 crore) in Series E round of funding from its three existing investors. Tiger Global led the investment with Accel Partners and Google Capital also participating in the round, it said on Monday. The funds will be used in enhancing its products for its Freshdesk and Freshservice support platforms. Freshdesk is a cloud-based customer support platform, which aims to make it easy for brands to talk to their customers and for users to get in touch with businesses. It was started to provide email and website integration customer support, and later launched phone-based Twitter and Facebook support as well. It recently launched Freshservice, a SaaS IT service desk that is providing a modern alternative to complex legacy IT support systems. In June 2014, it had raised $31 million (Rs 195 crore) in a Series D round of funding led by Tiger Global. Original early-stage investor Accel also participated in that round which also saw Google Capital coming in as a new investor. Freshdesk competes with California-headquartered Zendesk Inc, which went public last year, and Salesforce.com, which offers customer service tools aimed at SMBs and larger enterprises. First Google Capital investee outside the US: Freshdesk was the first company outside the US to get backing from Google Capital, one of the two venture capital arms of the American search giant. While Google Ventures is more of an early stage investor, Google Capital focuses on the growth stage. So the doubling down on the Chennai-based startup recognizes that it’s on a fast track to scale up globally. “Freshdesk offers a compelling, modern customer experience delivered with cloud-scale cost and flexibility. We are excited to support Freshdesk with additional investment,” says Gene Frantz, general partner with Google Capital. According to Mathrubootham, the association added to the Freshdesk mojo in more ways than one. On the marketing front, especially. For example, after Google Capital came on board, an expert from Google India did an in-depth analysis that helped Freshdesk zero in on the geographies where there was high demand for its software. It threw up insights like where people were searching for Freshdesk software, how the overall market for customer support was evolving, and how Freshdesk’s marketing campaign was working in different markets. “It had county-by-county data for the US on how the Freshdesk brand was being perceived. It was brilliant. We were able to see where we were strong or weak and tweak our Google AdWords campaign to exploit it more,” Mathrubootham shares with Tech in Asia, adding that he is still working closely with Google on this.China fines Alibaba $129,000 for pricing violations: China's e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group, has been fined 800,000 yuan ($129,000) by the price bureau in eastern Zhejiang province for violations by third-party sellers during promotions on its e-commerce platforms. Since Alibaba turned \"Singles' Day\", a November 11 Chinese response to Valentine's Day, into an online shopping festival in 2009, the event has grown to similar proportions as Cyber Monday and Black Friday in the United States. Sales of more than $9 billion were achieved at last year's event, and the company has copyrighted the phrase \"Double 11\", a reference to the date (11/11), which in turn, refers to the status of single people. \"The company has been fined 500,000 yuan ($81,000) for matters related to Singles' Day pricing by third-party sellers on our Tmall marketplace in 2013 and 2014 and 300,000 yuan($48,000) for pricing in other promotions in 2013 and 2015,\" Alibaba Group said in a statement on Friday. While pricing is handled by third parties, not directly by Alibaba, the group said, it would nevertheless reinforce pricing rules and regulations with sellers to protect consumers. The 27,000 vendors featured on Alibaba's Singles' Day shopping sites hope to boost sales and gain customers, but some have complained that discounts and cut-throat corporate rivalry undercut the benefits. Alibaba has had occasional difficulties regulating its sprawling e-commerce empire, which now includes online markets such as Taobao; Tmall, a platform for larger retailers linked to Taobao; group-buying site Juhuasuan and the original flagship platform Alibaba.com, which links exporters with foreign buyers. Alibaba shares have lost more than a fifth this year, with analysts citing concern about counterfeits along with lackluster third-quarter earnings and waning investor excitement after last September's record-setting $25-billion IPO.Offline to Online: Indonesian conglomerate Lippo prepares for a drive into e-Commerce: Indonesian conglomerate Lippo Group has appointed Credit Suisse and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to lead its first round of funding, worth $200 million, for its e-commerce push. Lippo, controlled by the Riady family, has also chosen Rothschild as its financial adviser for the transaction. The funding will be used to \"dominate e-commerce in Indonesia,\" it said in a statement on Monday. Lippo plans to launch payment, chat and other online services early next year as it expands in the nascent e-commerce industry of the world's fourth most populous country, director John Riady told Reuters last month. Lippo has already earmarked $500 million for a new online department store, and investment in services planned for the first quarter of 2016 will be on top of that, Riady said.China Halts New Policy on Tech for Banks: China has suspended a policy that would have effectively pushed foreign technology companies out of the country’s banking sector, according to a note sent by Chinese regulators to banks. Dated Monday, the letter called for banks to “suspend implementation” of the rules, which have been at the center of a brewing trade conflict between the United States and China. The rules, put into effect at the end of last year, called for companies that sell computer equipment to Chinese banks to turn over intellectual property and submit source code, in addition to other demands. At stake is billions of dollars of business for major American companies that make the advanced computing hardware and software that crunches numbers for banks across China. Trade groups representing companies including Microsoft, IBM and Apple have complained that such policies are protectionist. Yet the development is only a small reprieve for American tech companies. The suspension is temporary as authorities revise the rules. It is unclear how regulators will change the rules, but industry officials say a new version — even if it avoids more contentious issues like forcing the disclosure of source code — will still be problematic to multinational tech companies. China’s vice minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, informed Nathan Sheets, the Treasury’s under secretary, of the decision to suspend the rules during a meeting in Washington, a senior administration official said. The recent trade debate is part of a wider clash between China and the United States over online security and technology policy. Such backpedaling is rare for Chinese policy makers, yet there is a precedent. In 2009, China said all computers imported to the country must come with filtering software called Green Dam-Youth Escort preinstalled. After heavy international pressure, China suspended the rule indefinitely.Boomerang Commerce Launches A/B Testing Platform For Pricing: Boomerang Commerce, a startup that helps online retailers optimize their pricing and a 2014 Disrupt NY Startup Battlefield finalist, today announced the launch of its A/B testing service for pricing. Marketers love A/B testing to see which message works best, but when it comes to pricing, offering two different customers two different prices for the same product can quickly become a recipe for disaster. You’re bound to upset some customers, after all, when they find out they paid more for a product than somebody else. Boomerang CEO Guru Hariharan acknowledges as much. “You can’t just use standard tools,” he said. “If you do that, you’ll lose trust. More often than not, it’s a bad idea.” So what Boomerang does is allow retailers to test different pricing strategies and algorithms across a small group of products, for example, to test which ones maximize the retailers revenues and profits. The idea here then is less about charging customer A one price and customer B another, but to see which pricing strategies work better. Say you have 100,000 products in your inventory (the company only works with very large retailers that do $25 million or more in online sales). Boomerang now lets them take a representative set of 500 of these and test different pricing strategies on them. “Merchandizers and analysts at click and mortar retailers have had to wait months to draw conclusive results from price tests,” Hariharan said. “In the digital world, you don’t have that kind of luxury with time and need to make decisions as quickly as possible – often with limited data. This is why we believe that facilitating rapid testing of pricing strategies would help them figure out a way to set the right prices for their products in a timely manner.” Besides A/B testing, Boomerang also launched a number of other new products over the last couple of months, including a price optimizer that helps retailers manage a product’s pricing lifecycle from introductory pricing all the way to clearance markdowns. The company also recently launched an improve competitive pricing intelligence service that helps retailers stay on top of what their competitors are charging. The company has grown from 15 employees a year ago to 70 employees now. Hariharan tells me Boomerang’s software now manages about $2 billion in sales every year.The EU formally accused Google of abusing its dominance: The European Union’s antitrust chief on Wednesday formally accused Google of abusing its dominance in web searches, bringing charges that could limit the giant American tech company’s moneymaking prowess. How Google responds in the case — the biggest since the case against Microsoft in the 2000s — and to what degree the accusations hamper its own business or aid its rivals remain to be seen. Google holds a roughly 90 percent share in the region’s search market, and the company contends that in both web searches and Android software it plays fair. If Google fails to rebut the formal charges, Ms. Vestager could levy a fine that could exceed €6 billion — about 10 percent of Google’s most recent annual revenue. But the largest single fine yet levied in such a case falls well short of that mark: The record is €1.1 billion in 2009 against Intel for abusing its dominance of the computer chip market. The Google case is the most weighty decision by Ms. Vestager since she took office late last year. But the decision to open a separate investigation, into whether Google’s use of its Android operating system, might turn out to be as significant. Regulators will look into whether Google abused its dominant position by pre-installing its apps and services onto Android smartphones that potentially gave Google preferential treatment compared with its rivals. The investigation could take years. More here: The European Union accused Google Inc on Wednesday of cheating consumers and competitors by distorting Web search results to favor its own shopping service, after a five-year investigation that could change the rules for business online. It also started another antitrust investigation into the Android mobile operating system, a key element in Google's strategy to maintain revenues from online advertising as people switch from Web browser searches to smartphone apps. Europe is very important to Google: The European market contributes about 35 percent of Google’s revenue, according to Carlos Kirjner, a New York-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Its market share in search exceeds 90 percent in most European markets, compared with about 65 percent in the U.S. Google dropped as much as 1.4 percent to $523.22 in New York trading. The shares fell 1 percent to $525.30 at 10:25 a.m. local time.Hyperlocal grocery delivery startups are hot in India: Grofers raises $35M in Series B round, and PepperTap bags $10M two days after ZopNow’s $10M round: Hyper-local grocery and fresh food delivery platform Grofers, has raised $35 million (Rs 218 crore) from its existing investors Tiger Global Management and Sequoia Capital, the company said on Wednesday. Its second round of funding comes just two months after it closed a Series A fundraise worth $10 million from Tiger Global and Sequoia. The startup had previously raised seed funding from Sequoia and Deepinder Goyal, co-founder and CEO of Zomato. Separate media reports, citing sources, pegged Grofer’s valuation in the new funding round in the $110-115 million range. The company said it will use the funds to add products in addition to expanding services to more cities. Founded by Saurabh Kumar and Albinder Dhindsa, Grofers allows users to order products ranging from grocery to pet supplies and baby care products online and enables delivery within 90 minutes. It allows consumers order products available at brick and mortar stores through the Grofers mobile app. The smartphone-based grocery delivery platform currently partners with more than 400 merchants in Bangalore, Delhi-NCR and Mumbai. It expects to start delivering products in Hyderabad and Pune by next month. Grofers claims to have witnessed a sharp increase in the number of orders and expects to execute over 20,000 orders this month.IBM makes a big healthcare analytics play, ties up with Apple, J&J and Medtronic: IBM is taking its Watson artificial-intelligence technology into health care in a big way with industry partners, a pair of acquisitions and an ambitious agenda. The initial three industry partners are Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic. On Monday afternoon, after the close of stock trading, IBM also announced it would buy two start-ups: Explorys, a spin-off from the Cleveland Clinic whose data on 50 million patients is used to spot patterns in diseases, treatments and outcomes; and Phytel, a Dallas maker of software to manage patient care and reduce readmission rates to hospitals. The IBM plan, put simply, is that its Watson technology will be a cloud-based service that taps vast stores of health data and delivers tailored insights to hospitals, physicians, insurers, researchers and potentially even individual patients. “We’re going to enable personalized health care on a huge scale,” said John E. Kelly, a senior vice president who oversees IBM’s research labs and new initiatives. To date, IBM has done some individual projects using Watson technology with leading medical centers, including Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and the Cleveland Clinic. But the creation of the Watson Health unit, Mr. Kelly said, is an effort to apply the technology to the mainstream of health care. And while IBM has been commercializing Watson technology with tools for mining Twitter, weather and Internet of Things data, Mr. Kelly said Watson Health was the first move into a specific industry. The Watson Health announcement is also the latest in flurry of initiatives IBM has announced this year that include new corporate partnerships as well as moves in cloud computing, data analytics and Watson. They are evidence that IBM is intent on investing for future growth, and showing it is doing so, in a year when its financial performance is likely to lag. IBM has reported disappointing earnings recently, and Virginia M. Rometty, IBM’s chief executive, has told industry analysts and investors that 2015 would be a transition year in which new growth businesses like Watson did not yet overcome the profit erosion in some of its traditional hardware and software products.Zomato buys cloud-based PoS system; to help restaurants manage inventory, payments: Zomato.com, has acquired MapleGraph Solutions Pvt Ltd, which operated a point-of-sales business, for an undisclosed amount in what is its first acquisition outside its core business of restaurant listings and reviews, it said on Tuesday. Zomato is now launching its own version of the product under Zomato Base which would allow restaurants manage inventory and payments as well as provide real time analytics and more. The move would expand the revenue streams for Zomato, which currently draws bulk of its business from ads from restaurants. The firm has been looking at new ways to generate revenues and is starting an online food ordering and table reservation service. Zomato Base offers inventory and recipe management, analyses sales data to track restaurant’s performance, generates electronic receipts, as well as does payment gateway integration and menu management. Delhi-based MapleGraph was founded in 2011 by Arun Tangri (earlier worked with Microsoft and IBM India), Varun Tangri, (also co-founded Tokkri.com and DealerConnect.in) and Abhishek Rohilla (previously worked with Unisys and Siemens Information Systems). “Technology has seen very little penetration in the restaurant industry, and we are excited to be driving this change at large scale,” said Arun Tangri, co-founder and CEO, MapleGraph. “There is a lot that can be done if we are able to build a technology platform that connects consumers to restaurants and vice versa, and we believe that a world-class cloud-based POS system is the first step towards building that platform,” said Deepinder Goyal, co-founder and CEO, Zomato. Zomato will work on integrating the POS product’s services with the consumer product over the next few months. After the integration, Zomato will start offering Zomato Base to restaurant businesses across the world this fall.Opera launches new version of its Opera Mini browser with enhanced data compression; targets 350 million mobile browser users in 2017: Norway's Opera Software on Tuesday launched a new version of the Opera Mini browser for Android phones, hoping to more than double its smartphone user base by the end of 2017. Google's Android is the most widely used operating system among mobile phone makers. With the launch of Mini 8, Opera aims to lift its smartphone user base to 275 million by 2017 from the current 130 million, increasing the total to 350 million when including around 75 million users of less advanced feature phones. The purpose of using Mini, which has become particularly popular in many developing countries, is both to speed up online surfing and to cut costs, as the browser can compress data by up to 90 percent. Smartphone customers generally do much more online surfing, making them far more valuable than users of feature phones although Opera Software doesn't give revenue figures per user. \"It's complicated, we have customers in 200 countries and more and more of them are using smartphones and fewer are on feature phones,\" Opera investor relations chief Petter Lade told Reuters. \"Our target is to have 275 million smart phones and 75 million on feature phones, this will be our total target for mobile users for 2017,\" he added.As PEs increase Tech Funding, Founders find that Big Valuations Come With Dangerous Small Print: About three years ago we started noticing a sliver of founders who were obsessively focused on valuations start to make short-term decisions in their fundraising that risked meaningful long-term consequences. With the popularity of the “unicorn” label, this trend has gotten worse. A few months ago a Midas List friend shared a story of dismay with an example in their portfolio that typifies the situation. Their founder had two term sheets to choose from. One was a “clean” term sheet with no preferences beyond the norm and a barely sub-billion-dollar valuation. The other granted the magical, in the founders’ but not investors’ minds, $1 billion valuation in exchange for a set of onerous preferences. The founder chose the latter. The investor’s fear, which we share, is that the excessive focus on valuation, regardless of terms, can be significantly damaging over time — not just to the founder, but to his team and all the prior shareholders, including seed and venture investors. Part of this is due to the changing nature of funders; many mega-valuation, pref-heavy term sheets come from private equity (PE) shops like hedge and mutual funds accustomed to standardizing on downside protection and guaranteed returns, a very different game than venture.  PE shops are making even better returns than the already phenomenal ones we detailed through the issuance of additional shares, guaranteed return levels and other downside protections that protective prefs provide. And in the zero-sum game of return, additional return to one party comes out of the return, or through the dilution, of another; specifically founders, employees and prior investors alike. Let’s look at an example: Several years ago an entrepreneur raising money in a particularly heated round asked, “How do I get a billion?” He was entirely focused on hitting $1 billion in valuation above all else. He didn’t get to his billion target in that round, though he got close, but he did in a later round, at a significant cost. The cost was paid when the company went public. The cost of the valuation was a guaranteed return on the investment made: at least 2x on IPO. Beyond being onerous, as the IPO proved, it set a precedent and pattern. A later investor got a guarantee of 1.5x and the one thereafter a more traditional 1x; although a 1x guarantee on IPO is very different from a traditional 1x liquidation preference, which only kicks in on the sale of the company or a similar event. When the company IPOed it did so below the $1 billion valuation, and the preferences kicked in. In order to make good on the guarantees the company had to issue additional post- IPO stock, which diluted all the non-pref-enriched shareholders by almost 15 percent. The company’s shares also traded down significantly on opening day, chalking up an unwanted record; the biggest first day dip in IPO price of any U.S. company that year. More recently, when Box priced its IPO at $14 a share, below its last private round at $20, it triggered the preferences to their last private investors, Coatue and TPG, including “profit protection.” According to Box’s S-1, every share of Series F stock converted into shares of common stock equal to $20 divided by the lesser of 90 percent of the price per share of common stock, or $20, meaning Series F investors were guaranteed at least a 10 percent discount to the IPO price. If not the balance was made up in additional stock grants. So if Box priced at $22.22 or above, the Series F shareholders wouldn’t receive any additional shares from their preference for the shares they paid $20 thereby locking in a 10 percent profit plus all upside above $22.22. But Box priced at $14, triggering the preference and ever Series F share converted into 1.587 shares of public common, versus the one-to-one conversion they would have achieved at a $22.22 price, and further diluted the shareholder base. Box’s most recent 10K reports a share count of 119.8 million, but if the series F had not converted the number would have been 115.4 million, meaning the company issued an additional 4.4 million shares as a make good on top of the original 7.5 million shares originally converted. Without a conversion preference, the Series F holders would have converted to 6.5 percent of the shares, with the preference that increased, post IPO, to 10 percent (54  percent accretion for Series F PE shareholders) and lowered the remaining shareholders ownership from 93.5 percent to 90 percent. To make this that much more frustrating to the founders and investors before the final investor, Box’s shares actually traded as high as $24.73 on opening day, well above the $22.22 protection price, but since ratchets are triggered by IPO pricing the last private round investors received their additional shares regardless. Prior private preferred rounds (PPR) are not uncommon in IPOs, but they do appear to be more common in TMT (Technology Media & Telecommunications) IPOs, and are even more pronounced in TMT IPO down rounds.Written-off and forgotten, but still going: Groupon Market Value Seen as High as $6 Billion With Divestments: Groupon Inc. could divest four businesses in the next two years, netting as much as $730 million, to raise cash as it expands into an e-commerce marketplace, according to Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos. Groupon has a market value of about $5 billion, though it should be closer to $6 billion because those businesses are undervalued, Munster said. A majority stake in its Ticket Monster business, which offers daily deals and e-commerce services in South Korea, could fetch about $500 million, while smaller units might yield between $30 million and $100 million each, he said. With a stock that trades at little more than a third of its 2011 initial public offering price, Groupon has shifted its focus from e-mailed daily deals to competing with Amazon.com Inc. and EBay Inc. as a marketplace. To do so, it will need to sell some non-core properties to free up more cash to invest in the initiative, some analysts said. As of the end of December, the Chicago-based company had about $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents. “What is safe to say is that Groupon has several stealth assets that are generally underappreciated by investors as far as overall value,” said Munster, who is based in Minneapolis. Private equity firms are the most likely buyers, he said. Groupon shares have climbed 28 percent in the past six months to $7.39 in New York. Still they are 63 percent below the IPO price of $20 set in November 2011. Proceeds from the sales could help Groupon make acquisitions to expand its e-commerce operations, including online retailers or a payments business, Sweeney said. Another option -- buying a service that delivers food or goods to customers, Tom Taulli, the author of The Complete M&A Handbook, said in an interview. Or it could put the money into new fulfillment centers, Sweeney said. Groupon is testing Groupon Stores, where businesses can post their offerings. It’s also testing movie downloads from its site.Tencent market value breaks US$200 billion: China’s Tencent broke new ground on Monday when its stock (00700.HK) closed at HK$170.50, bringing the company’s total market value above US$200 billion for the first time ever. Tencent has been one of China’s biggest internet companies since the very beginning with its QQ messaging service. These days, the company has its hands in almost every corner of the internet industry. It remains the top player in China’s social media and messaging sector, and it also dominates a number of other sectors including online and mobile gaming.Urban Ladder aims for $100M in GMV, outlines tech-product plans: The firm has just raised $50 million in a fresh round of funding from both new and existing investors. The main focus is to expand our products and services to more cities, which we have been doing for the last six-seven months. The next focus is technology—we are focusing on innovations in customer experience, mobility, automation and analytics. We are trying to offer a new customer experience, helping customers get a sense of our products. We believe a lot of innovation needs to happen in this space. Mobility is getting a big push. Customers are doing a lot of discovery, exploration and transactions via mobile. Once we have the right products, services and technology in place, we would want to enable a marriage of these aspects to bring out greater results. Our aim is to invite the customer to give us the key to his/her house so that we can design and furnish an extremely beautiful house and give the key back to the customer in just three weeks through a tech-enabled process. A lot of innovation needs to happen on the customer experience and the web (store) part. We are investing a lot on mobile technologies to provide a great experience on the core catalogue as well as on areas like visualisation, personalisation and app development. A bunch of innovations will come out on how customers interact with products on mobile and how customers engage with the brand on mobile. We are building a strong technology, user experience and product management team to look into these aspects. We are also looking at technologies such as ERP, GPS and RFID to automate and ensure smooth flow of information throughout the process without any manual involvement. Analytics is another key area of focus in terms of real-time data and dashboards. We now have a scale of data with which we will be able to gain a lot of inputs on buying patterns and personalisation can be done much more effectively with real-time analytics.Marissa Mayer Shuffles Yahoo Leadership Team; Tumblr Struggles Lead to Founder's Demotion: Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive, announced a major reorganization of the company’s product teams on Friday, promoting the head of one recently acquired company and effectively demoting the chief of another. Under the new structure, Simon Khalaf, the Internet company’s data-spouting prophet of mobile, will become a senior vice president and oversee many of the company’s consumer-facing products, including the Yahoo home page, its portals devoted to themes like sports and movies, and related Yahoo apps. Mr. Khalaf joined Yahoo in July when it bought his mobile analytics company, Flurry, for about $300 million. Flurry, which offers data and advertising services to mobile app developers, has since become the core of Yahoo’s efforts to compete with Google, Facebook and Twitter to persuade developers to use its tools. Mr. Khalaf, a rapid-fire speaker with a knack for presenting complex information simply and clearly, has become a crucial Yahoo ambassador to the outside world and played a starring role at Yahoo’s recent mobile developer conference. As part of the reorganization, the blogging platform Tumblr and its chief executive, David Karp, will report to Mr. Khalaf, according to an internal announcement made at Yahoo Friday morning. Although Mr. Karp will remain part of the executive team, he will no longer report directly to Ms. Mayer, which he has done since he sold Tumblr to Yahoo for $1.1 billion in 2013. The move reflects Tumblr’s struggles to broaden its appeal beyond its core audience of of artists, teenagers and 20somethings looking for a platform to express themselves. Tumblr has served as the technology behind Yahoo’s digital magazines, but it has faced challenges in luring advertising. Tumblr’s top ad executive, Lee Brown, recently left the company and joined BuzzFeed after Yahoo integrated Tumblr’s ad sales with Yahoo’s. Mike Kerns, the senior vice president who previously oversaw Yahoo’s home page and verticals, is leaving the company to pursue entrepreneurial opportunitiesApple Watch Sold Out Despite Scarce In-Store Crowds: (More here) Few people lined up at Apple Inc. stores from Beijing to New York to get a peek of the company’s new smartwatch, while online pre-orders pushed delivery dates for some versions into July. The Apple Watch, a test of Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s ability to innovate, arrived Friday in stores in eight countries and Hong Kong for customers to preview. It officially goes on sale April 24, when delivery begins of devices that have been ordered. Delivery times quickly pushed passed that date, after Apple began taking online pre-orders about 3 a.m. in New York. By about 9 a.m. shipments of high-end versions, which can cost as much as $17,000, were delayed until June. All 10 versions of the entry-level Sport, which starts at $349, were delayed until June, according to the company’s U.S. website. Mid-tier models were being promised for delivery in four to six weeks, with four versions stretching into June or July. “We view this as an indication of solid demand paired with very limited supply, with supply being the most significant limiting factor,” Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Cos., said Friday in a note to investors.China Is Said to Use Powerful New Weapon to Censor Internet: Late last month, China began flooding American websites with a barrage of Internet traffic in an apparent effort to take out services that allow China’s Internet users to view websites otherwise blocked in the country. Initial security reports suggested that China had crippled the services by exploiting its own Internet filter — known as the Great Firewall — to redirect overwhelming amounts of traffic to its targets. Now, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Toronto say China did not use the Great Firewall after all, but rather a powerful new weapon that they are calling the Great Cannon. The Great Cannon, the researchers said in a report published on Friday, allows China to intercept foreign web traffic as it flows to Chinese websites, inject malicious code and repurpose the traffic as Beijing sees fit. The system was used, they said, to intercept web and advertising traffic intended for Baidu — China’s biggest search engine company — and fire it at GitHub, a popular site for programmers, and GreatFire.org, a nonprofit that runs mirror images of sites that are blocked inside China. The attacks against the services continued on Thursday, the researchers said, even though both sites appeared to be operating normally. But the researchers suggested that the system could have more powerful capabilities. With a few tweaks, the Great Cannon could be used to spy on anyone who happens to fetch content hosted on a Chinese computer, even by visiting a non-Chinese website that contains Chinese advertising content. “The operational deployment of the Great Cannon represents a significant escalation in state-level information control,” the researchers said in their report. It is, they said, “the normalization of widespread and public use of an attack tool to enforce censorship.” The researchers, who have previously done extensive research into government surveillance tools, found that while the infrastructure and code for the attacks bear similarities to the Great Firewall, the attacks came from a separate device. The device has the ability not only to snoop on Internet traffic but also to alter the traffic and direct it — on a giant scale — to any website, in what is called a “man in the middle attack.” China’s new Internet weapon, the report says, is similar to one developed and used by the National Security Agency and its British counterpart, GCHQ, a system outlined in classified documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former United States intelligence contractor. The American system, according to the documents, which were published by The Intercept, can deploy a system of programs that can intercept web traffic on a mass scale and redirect it to a site of their choosing. The N.S.A. and its partners appear to use the programs for targeted surveillance, whereas China appears to use the Great Cannon for an aggressive form of censorship.Spotify Said to Seek Financing to Value Music Site at $8 Billion: Spotify Ltd. is in the process of raising new financing that would value the largest subscription music-streaming service at about $8 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. That valuation is double what the company was worth when it raised money in November 2013. The latest round totals about $400 million, according to one of the individuals, and comes from a group that includes Goldman Sachs Group and an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Spotify continues to raise money as it tries to build a global subscription music service before Apple Inc. or Google Inc., which are both pursuing the same market. Spotify has more than 60 million users, a quarter of whom pay $9.99 for a monthly, ad-free version. Like Pandora Media Inc., a public company valued at $3.55 billion, Spotify pays a large percentage of its revenue to record labels and publishers for the right to license their music. With sales of both CDs and digital downloads in decline, the three major record labels -- Vivendi SA’s Universal Music Group, Sony Corp.’s Sony Music Entertainment and Access Industries’ Warner Music Group -- view streaming as the key to future growth. Though the labels own a stake in Spotify, they have complained about the money they receive from the company and pushed for greater restrictions to its free service. Spotify has resisted those overtures, arguing that an appealing free service is the best way to lure customers who will then subscribe. Listeners must have a subscription to access the full offering on a mobile phone.Whatever Happened To PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)? Why do people still spin up and set up their own AWS and Compute Engine instances? Why have App Engine and Heroku and Elastic Beanstalk not conquered all? Is fine-grained control really that important? I suspect the reason is three-pronged: cost, lock-in, and culture. App Engine’s prices drop regularly, but they’re voluminous and confusing, and a single instance — a pretty puny virtual machine — costs more than a dollar day, not counting storage or bandwidth. Same for Heroku. You get more bang-per-buck by simply buying and running your own servers. You also get enormously larger headaches, and significantly slower development time; but that tradeoff isn’t worth it for many. Then there’s lock-in. Once you build your app atop App Engine’s custom APIs, you’re committed; there’s no easy way to back away and go to another provider. The lock-in is less for other PaaS providers, but it’s still there. There is no universal PaaS equivalent of de facto IaaS (infrastructure-as-a-service) standards such as OpenStack or Docker. The third, least valid, and arguably most powerful reason is culture. Companies don’t want to give up perceived control over their systems–even if that control is never worth its associated complexity–and sysadmins, understandably, don’t want to evolve themselves out of a job. The thing about all three of those reasons not to go PaaS, however, is that they’re temporary. Costs keep dropping. Culture keeps changing. And there are signs of slow movement towards interchangeable PaaS services and standards. (You could argue that Docker itself is a stride in that direction.) In the early days of electricity, factories all had their own generators; then, eventually, they moved to the grid. IaaS is the equivalent of every individual company getting their raw electrical power from the grid … but stepping it down with their own transformers and converting from three-phase to one-phase in-house. I suspect we’re still en route towards a largely PaaS world where server code mostly just runs, without developers knowing or caring about the servers in question. It’s just happening a little slower than I’d like.India startup action#1: Ola raises $310M led by DST Global; valued at $2.3B:  Ola (formerly Olacabs), has raised $310 million (Rs 1,952 crore) in its fresh round of funding led by Russian investment firm DST Global, according to VCCEdge, the data research platform of VCCircle, based on filings with Registrar of Companies. The latest deal values Ola at Rs 14,552 crore ($2.3 billion), almost four times its valuation in October when Japan’s SoftBank led a $210 million funding round in the company. DST, which backed India’s largest e-com venture Flipkart last year, has brought in Rs 1,153 crore ($185 million) and has picked 7.9 per cent stake, becoming the fourth-largest shareholder in the company behind SoftBank, Tiger Global and Matrix Partners. The round also saw participation from a bunch of other existing and new investors, including a few who joined in recently with the acquisition of TaxiForSure through a cash-and-stock transaction. While Ola’s single-biggest shareholder SoftBank did not participate in the latest funding, its first institutional backer Tiger Global brought in $40 million to restrict equity dilution.India startup action #2: Urban Ladder raises $50M led by Sequoia & TR Capital: Urban Ladder, has secured $50 million in Series C round of funding led by Sequoia Capital and TR Capital. Existing investors Steadview Capital, SAIF Partners and Kalaari Capital also participated. Urban Ladder was launched in July 2012 and offers a curated range of over 4,000 products across more than 35 categories in furniture and home décor. It was co-founded by Ashish Goel and Rajiv Srivatsa. At present, Urban Ladder delivers to 12 cities in India (Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi/NCR, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad, Cochin Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Surat, Kolkata and Mangalore). Last year, it said it aims to hit 25-30 cities by March 2015. Now it has extended the time period to reach this goal. The latest funding comes just nine months after it raised $20 million in Series B round of led by Steadview Capital, with participation from SAIF Partners and Kalaari Capital. In the past, it has raised $5 million in Series A from SAIF and Kalaari and prior to that it got around $1 million from Kalaari. Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus, Tata Group, also made a small personal investment in the company in November 2014. Although the amount was not disclosed, it is believed to be in the region of around $1 million. It competes with the likes of Rocket Internet-incubated FabFurnish and Pepperfry.com, besides other horizontal e-commerce players such as Flipkart.com, Snapdeal.com and Amazon.in. Among the investors, the deal deepens Sequoia’s bet on vertical e-com space in India. The VC firm has backed several single vertical e-tailers and has just got an exposure to Snapdeal. The horizontal e-com marketplace has acquired FreeCharge in a deal which gives Sequoia among other VC investors of the mobile recharge company a stake in Snapdeal. TR Capital is a Hong Kong-based mid-market PE firm targeting investments in Asia. This is its second known investment in India. Early this year TR Capital co-invested with TPG and others in eyewear e-tailer Lenskart.Intel Said to End Talks to Buy Chip Designer Altera: Intel has ended discussions to buy Altera, a designer of specialized computer chips, people briefed on the matter said on Thursday, putting to rest what would have been the company’s biggest-ever takeover. The collapse of the talks halts what would have been the latest in a series of mergers of chip makers and designers as companies turn to consolidation to gain negotiating leverage with customers. And yet investors still appear hopeful that Altera will ultimately be sold. Though shares of Altera initially fell after CNBC reported the end of negotiations, they closed up 3 percent on Thursday, at $43.33. Shares in Intel ended down slightly, at $31.24. Intel first made a takeover offer several weeks ago of more than $50 a share, a premium of more than 40 percent to Altera’s stock price at the time, one of the people said. Ultimately, however, Altera rejected the approach, and talks between the two companies had gone quiet in recent days. It was unclear whether the talks would be revived. A takeover would have been, by far, the biggest deal by Intel in its 46-year history. To date, its largest takeover was the $7.5 billion acquisition of McAfee, a security software maker. Just six of the company’s deals have been worth more than $1 billion. Several analysts have said that they still think Intel will be on the hunt for acquisitions.Apple Watch Reviews: You’ll Want One, but You Don’t Need One: Should you buy an Apple Watch? The first reviews are here. The first reviews of the Apple Watch are in, and the verdict is: This is a good product with a bright future. But maybe don't buy one quite yet. That's not to say the reviews weren't glowing, because they were. Anyone who was hoping that the Watch would flop out of the box and fall short of the high standard that Apple boasts for its products is going to be disappointed. There's also no doubt, from these reviews, that Apple's smartwatch is immediately the best of its kind on the market. \"[The] Apple Watch is, above all, a satisfying indulgence,\" writes Yahoo Tech's David Pogue. \"It’s a luxury. You might buy it to bring you pleasure — and it will — much the way you might buy a really nice car, some really nice clothes, or a really nice entrée.\" Overall, reviewers say that the Watch works well, has the battery life it needs and features such as Apple Pay work well. Plus, the Watch just feels nice. But there are criticisms, and strong ones, about how far the product needs to go to appeal to everyone. At the very least, it certainly is -- to quote the headline on The New York Times' Farhad Manjoo review--  a device that comes into its own after a \"steep learning curve.\" The gripes, as always, are the most telling part of the reviews. Manjoo, for example, warns that this is not necessarily a simple device to understand. That's contrary to Apple's normal reputation -- the iPhone, for example, is a great smartphone for technophobes because it's so easy to navigate. But that's not the market that should (or probably would) pick up the first generation of the Watch. Other criticisms range from the fact that the device is a little slow (Nilay Patel, The Verge) to complaints that it's still a little too clunky to be fashionable (Lauren Goode, Re/Code), which could pose a hurdle for wider adoption. Ed Baig at USA Today  says that he also doesn't particularly like making phone calls on it -- though that's not going to stop him from buying one of his own. There are also some greater concerns about smoothly it actually works. Several reviewers said that apps made by companies other than Apple were slow to load and work on the Watch. That will improve over time as software developers get more comfortable with the platform, but is an early hiccup worth noting. It also relies on other Apple software such as the company's Siri voice control software, which Manjoo notes fails to work as often as it's successful. Mashable's Lance Ulanoff says that it's not spectacularly good at working as a fitness tracker, either. That's one of the main draws of the wearable market right now, as products such as Jawbone and Fitbit have shown, and one of the easiest markets for Apple to pick up. The convenience of having a fitness tracker with some phone functions might be enough to win converts, but it seems that, for now, fitness management isn't exactly a killer app for the Watch.Alibaba finance arm Ant Financial to launch online private bank in June: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's finance arm will launch its private internet bank, to be called MYbank in June, Yuan Leiming, Ant Financial's general manager of its finance division, told Reuters in an interview in Beijing on Thursday. Ant Financial will hold a 30 percent stake. Other shareholders will be: Shanghai Fosun Industrial Technology Development Co. Ltd, a subsidiary of Fosun International Ltd, with a 25 percent stake; a subsidiary of Wanxiang Group will hold 18 percent; and Ningbo Jinrun Asset Management will own 16 percent. Alibaba and affiliate Ant have big ambitions for financial services in China, which have traditionally been geared toward larger and state-owned businesses and neglected individuals and smaller enterprises.Measuring Social ‘Trust’ to Make Loans: Alternative consumer lenders tend to fit into one of two camps: peer-to-peer marketplaces like Lending Tree and Prosper, and start-ups using data science to parse credit risk, like Affirm, Earnest and Zest Finance.Vouch Financial, which is emerging from its pilot testing phase this week, has an unusual spin on the data science approach. Big data lenders often analyze a person’s social network on LinkedIn or Facebook as one signal, among many, for hints about how reliable a payer a loan candidate is likely to be. But Vouch wants you to construct a social network of people who trust you financially — people who will, yes, vouch for you.The Vouch formula looks to back to a bygone era of banking when community bankers routinely asked their customers for “social character” references before granting loans. “We’ve taken that principle and digitized it,” said Yee Lee, co-founder and chief executive of Vouch.It also borrows from the concept of co-signing for loans, when a relative or friend is liable for repayment if the borrower turns out to be a deadbeat.Founded in 2013, Vouch made its first loan last October. By now, Mr. Lee said, Vouch has made “hundreds” of loans ranging in size from $500 to $15,000. They are installment loans with repayment typically stretched over 12 to 36 months.Borrowers build online trust networks by sending messages to friends and family members to vouch for them, and typically to commit some amount of money if the borrower does not repay. The people in the network are not asked to co-sign the loan in a traditional sense. But they are asked to explain their relationship to the person and commit an amount of money they will pay if the borrower does not repay. The commitment can be as little as $25 but has been up to $1,000 or more.So joining a person’s vouch network is an expression of trust in that person with a dollar amount placed on it. The vouchers sign an electronic agreement to pay, if necessary, that is legally enforceable, Mr. Lee explained.The members of a trust network fill out online surveys, identifying themselves — which is then verified by Vouch — and they agree to have their own credit histories looked up. Several thousand people, Mr. Lee said, have already joined the company’s networks of reciprocal trust. “We’re ingesting a lot of data,” Mr. Lee said.The company is really just getting started, but the idea is to collect data on trust signals and experience on lending, and build increasingly refined and accurate predictive models. Richard Lewis, Vouch’s chief risk officer, said the goal was to bring the concept of community banking reference checks into the digital age. “We want to make it analytic, quantifiable, scalable and fair,” he said. Mr. Lee provided a simplified example of different trust networks and lending decisions: Take two young people, both 22 years old, both living in Westwood, Calif., and both with 620 FICO scores — just into subprime territory by the traditional FICO yardstick of creditworthiness, which relies heavily on a person’s credit history. One borrower is a young man and has assembled a 10-person network. It’s a sizable number of trust connections, but they all come from the same address, the fraternity house at the university from which the borrower recently graduated. The second loan candidate is a young woman with only three people in her network. But one is her mother who is willing to vouch $1,000, and Mom has an 800 FICO score. And the other two people in her network live in Austin, Tex., and Newark., and have the same last name as the young woman. The 22-year-old young woman, Mr. Lee observed, would get somewhat better terms on her loan, given the strength rather than the breadth of her trust network. The start-up’s borrowers range in age from their 20s to 50s, across a demographic spectrum, but the most common loan use so far has been to pay off high-rate credit card debt, Mr. Lee said. Vouch has apparently done a lot of spade work with regulators. It is chartered, Mr. Lee said, in 50 states. To date, it has raised $3.6 million from venture capital firms including IDG Ventures and Greylock Partners.India startup action #1: Quikr gets $150M funding as it battles global giants for India’s classifieds market: Quikr, a classifieds site that’s one of India’s best-funded startups, today revealed that it has secured a further US$150 million in funding. This is its eighth major round of funding, which now totals nearly US$350 million. “The big things for us going forward are to continue to innovate for India, innovate for mobile, and go deeper in key categories where we already are leaders,” said Pranay Chulet, founder and CEO of Quikr, in a statement. The fresh investment will go towards Quikr’s push for smartphone users and to help build an upcoming, spin-off real estate portal, reports NextBigWhat. More here: Quikr raises $150M from Tiger Global, Kinnevik & Steadview Capital: Online classifieds site Quikr.com, has raised $150 million (over Rs 900 crore) from existing investors Tiger Global and Sweden’s Kinnevik besides a new investor Steadview Capital Management, it said on Tuesday. The venture essentially competes with Naspers-backed OLX in the P2P classifieds business in India. This fresh round of funding will be used to further invest in Quikr’s fast growing mobile business and in its key categories such as cars, real estate, jobs and services. Founded in 2008 by Chulet and Jiby Thomas (who quit the firm later), Quikr was originally started as Kijiji India. The firm later rebranded to Quikr. It is a large scale cross-category classifieds business with over 30 million consumers. These consumers come to Quikr to sell, buy, rent or find products and services in a variety of categories such as electronics and household goods, real estate, cars, bikes, jobs and services. The firm claims that small businesses across 1,000 cities are using the site. It recently announced the launch of a new classifieds website for real estate called quikrhomes.com to allow B2C as well as C2C discovery of properties up for sale as well as those available for rent. For new investor Steadview Capital, this marks another large deal in India. Last year the Hong Kong-based alternative assets manager had backed marquee firms in the digital commerce space in India—e-com venture Flipkart and online cabs aggregator Ola.Apple to Push Watch Buyers Online to Avoid Long Lines at Stores: When it comes to buying the Apple Watch, it’s time to think different. Angela Ahrendts, Apple Inc.’s sales chief, wants to scrap the company’s tradition of having customers wait in line, sometimes for days, to get their hands on the latest gadget. Apple has instructed its sales force to prod shoppers to the company’s website to purchase the new smartwatch, which can be pre-ordered Friday. “The days of waiting in line and crossing fingers for a product are over for our customers,” according to a memo to Apple sales staff. “This is a significant change in mindset and we need your help to make it happen.” Business Insider earlier reported on the memo. The approach is the first indication of where Ahrendts is taking the Apple buying experience since joining the company about a year ago from British luxury retailer Burberry Group Plc. While the Apple watch starts as low as $349, its top-end $17,000 gold version pushes the Cupertino, California-based company into a new, lofty realm. “This is not simply a consumer-electronics good -- it’s a luxury good,” J.P. Gownder, an analyst with Forrester Research, said. “There are a lot of good reasons to” to change “but there is that danger that it maybe a little bit, literally, buzz killing.” Apple on Friday begins taking pre-orders online after 3:01 a.m. New York time. Shoppers also will be able to try on the device starting Friday, by appointment. Apple hasn’t begun accepting appointments yet. The watch officially goes on sale April 24 in eight countries and Hong Kong. Encouraging Apple Watch shoppers to make appointments may help the company explain the complicated pricing and options and sell customers on why they would really want it, Gownder said. The watch is being offered in two sizes and three styles as well as different options for bands. The iPhone 6, for example, has three memory and three color options. The watch -- which aims to provide new ways to communicate, track fitness goals and give directions, among other things -- is the first new gadget from Apple in five years. The visibility may help bring greater attention to the total market for wearable devices, such as offerings from Samsung Electronics Co. The global market for all smartwatches may rise to 28.1 million units this year from 4.6 million, according to researcher Strategy Analytics. Sales of the Apple Watch may reach almost 14 million in the fiscal year through September, according to the average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.Xiaomi ends exclusive arrangement with Flipkart, will sell on Amazon, Snapdeal, others in India: When Xiaomi first launched in India last July, the Chinese gadget maker did so with online-only sales through one ecommerce store – Flipkart. That ends today as Xiaomi’s India boss, Manu Kumar Jain, announced a wide array of new ways for Indian consumers to buy its smartphones or tablets. Xiaomi has tapped Airtel India’s stores for sales before with the Redmi Note 4G, but the sales channels through Amazon India, Snapdeal, and The Mobile Stores are brand-new. The Mobile Stores has 300 outlets across the country. In addition to that, Jain announced today that Xiaomi would do away with its pre-registrations for flash sales of its Redmi 2 and Mi Pad in a sign that the company is better able to produce supply to meet demand. Xiaomi’s flash sales have been criticized by some users for proving frustrating.India startup action #2: Indian mobile wallet MobiKwik scores $25M from Sequoia, Amex, Tree Line, Cisco: Tree Line Asia, Cisco Investments, American Express, and Sequoia Capital are betting on MobiKwik. The firms gave close to US$25 million to the mobile wallet startup. Based in India, MobiKwik is a mobile payment solution. MobiKwik wants to be the only payment service people need. Since the startup has partnered with the major credit cards and 51 internet banking providers as well as 25,000 merchants, users can pay bills and buy products with the service. With partner companies, there is no need to input data like a credit card string. Users just need to sign in and pay, similar to rival Paytm. Cash can be added to your accounts at physical retail stores. Though a browser version exists, the company is best known for its Android, iOS, and Windows apps.HP Comes to Terms With the Cloud: A year ago, Hewlett-Packard thought it was going to change cloud computing. Now it looks more as if cloud computing is changing HP, just as the company enters one of the greatest attempts at reorganization in the history of technology. Meg Whitman, HP’s chief executive, will at the end of October split HP  into two companies. One will be generally focused on business technology and one on consumer-friendly areas of personal computers and printers. HP thought it would compete with Amazon, Google, and Microsoft for business rentals of computing power via so-called public cloud assets. Companies like Netflix, Snapchat and 3M now run significant parts of their businesses in such clouds, and the field is growing rapidly. After looking at the market, however, HP is now ceding the public cloud. “We thought people would rent or buy computing from us,” said Bill Hilf, the head of HP’s cloud business. “It turns out that it makes no sense for us to go head-to-head.” HP is still selling servers, but increasingly it looks like its biggest customers will be cloud companies themselves, or other computing behemoths, like Facebook. For thousands of other customers, Ms. Whitman hopes to build smaller cloud systems, while figuring out ways these companies can also use Amazon or Microsoft. One such buyer, the Fox Entertainment Group, uses HP computers to create content, but it looks to Microsoft to run its email or handle heavy workloads of noncritical information It uses a cloud run by Salesforce.com for sales management, and others to share things like the latest film both with artists inside Fox and with outside special effects and marketing companies. HP has some business in selling equipment, and more in the related businesses of management and security software, among other things, to hold the disparate parts together. “We have to balance decisions about the content we’re creating that we have to control, with security, financial and work-flow decisions,” said John Herbert, the chief information officer at Fox. “We’ve pushed HP to give us a lot of automation and flexibility.” That is a big change after an understandable mistake. HP dominated the sales of computer servers to business, so it probably looked like an easy transition to selling computing in a new way. In fact, the scale of the big public clouds, each with more than one million servers, is hard to learn, and the field is a tough place for newcomers to profit.OYO Rooms, A Network of Branded Budget Hotels in India, Raises $25M: In the largest funding round to date for a Thiel Fellow project, Ritesh Agarwal has raised $25 million from Lightspeed, Sequoia and others to build a branded budget hotel network across India. Called OYO Rooms, the company partners with property owners across India and makes sure that their facilities meet a baseline of requirements from linen quality to breakfast to Internet access for a starting price of 999 rupees or $16 a night. The company, which has booked around 60,000 stays so far since starting almost two years ago, works with each partner hotel to improve their facilities over the span of a week before launching on the platform. While other tech companies like Airbnb also have a growing footprint across the country, Agarwal says that the Indian short-term rental market needs to guarantee a basic quality level that a ratings or reviews system meets only some of the time. While the U.S. and other European countries have long had chains like Best Western or Ibis, he argues that the Indian budget hotel market is still lacking in this area. He compares Airbnb to a Sidecar-like model while OYO has a more Uber-like approach where they focus on instant gratification and minimum quality standards. On the OYO platform, guests can do on-demand booking without waiting for a reply from a host, and they can check in and out instantaneously instead of waiting at a reservation desk. They’ve partnered with more than 200 hotels across 10 cities in India. By the end of the year, they plan to quintuple in size with a network of 1,000 hotels in 25 cities.  Along with Lightspeed and Sequoia, Greenoaks Capital and DSG Consumer Partners also participated in the round.The Hackathon Fast Track, From Campus to Silicon Valley: Hackathons have become commonplace among professional developers, especially in booming tech centers like San Francisco and New York, and have emerged as prime places for networking, job recruiting, entrepreneurial pitching and, in many cases, winning cash. (One sponsored by the tech company Salesforce famously offered a $1 million prize to the most innovative project.) Now weekend hackathons organized by and for students are surging in size, scale and frequency. “A few years ago, hackathons weren’t really that popular — it was sort of a subculture,” says Kathryn Siegel, a junior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “There’s been an enormous explosion.” The longest-running collegiate hackathon, founded at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009, has since ballooned to accommodate 1,200 students each semester. Demand, though, is far outpacing growth. At TreeHacks, 2,500 applied for 500 spots. (Capacity was later expanded to 672, which required setting up a heated outdoor tent.) More than 250 participants traveled to Palo Alto, Calif., from some 60 universities, including five Ivy League schools, top-tier engineering programs like Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Georgia Tech, and universities as far away as the United Kingdom and Taiwan. Hackathon-goers maintain that what motivates them is not the awards. Mr. Hashme, who directs the University of Maryland’s Bitcamp, has participated in more than 40 hackathons since 2013. He says he attends because they force him to learn new tech skills. “Sitting in your dorm alone and trying to work on something, you wind up doing things you regret later, like watching a movie or browsing the Internet,” he says. At hackathons he enjoys meeting like-minded students from across the country — “It’s a room full of doers.” Fostering an education-first ethos, collegiate hackathons encourage students to tinker with new software and hardware and challenge themselves, and students teach one another. “There’s an expert on nearly anything there,” says Dave Fontenot, a former director of MHacks. “If you ask who the best JavaScript person is, pretty soon you’re meeting a GitHub celebrity.” (GitHub, a user-generated online repository for sharing computer code, is like a Wikipedia for software.) At TreeHacks, a team of Apple engineers was on hand to mentor students at all hours of the night. Collegiate hackathons have replicated that scene on a far grander scale. Identifying talented coders who can dream big and thrive under pressure is particularly valuable to Silicon Valley. Since hackathons showcase some of the best, brightest and most motivated upstart programmers, the events have become a focal point for recruiting. Some say hackathons are as fruitful as job fairs.Alibaba-backed ShopRunner, brand-focused US e-commerce site, gains momentum, eyes China: ShopRunner Inc, the e-commerce startup backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd that styles itself in some ways as the anti-Amazon, more than doubled its users over the past year and hopes to do so again in 2015, Shoprunner's chief executive said in an interview. The five-year old online retailer's gains may allow it to win over more customers who prize convenience and experience over cost savings, while taking advantage of its Alibaba relationship to help American retailers sell to China's still-growing middle class. ShopRunner borrows some of Amazon.com Inc's innovations: it charges $79 for two-day shipping to Amazon's $99. And it has an express checkout akin to its larger rival's one-click-buying feature. But CEO Scott Thompson says ShopRunner aims to be more like an online shopping mall that showcases brands than an Amazon or eBay marketplace where the focus is on lowest price. It also gives partners - ranging from Cole Haan and Under Armour to Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] - ownership of customer data and relationships. \"These businesses spend a lot of money to do the right thing with their brands,\" Thompson told Reuters in an interview. \"I want the segment of customer who says I want to pay a fair price, but I want the experience to be predictable.\" ShopRunner is one of a number of startups nibbling away at Amazon's dominance of the online arena.It remains to be seen whether any will make waves. The soon-to-be-launched Jet, for instance, is raising funds from investors at a rapid clip and hopes to carve out a niche in lowest-price shopping. ShopRunner membership is now at 2.4 million, though it is unclear how many of those users signed on through American Express Co, an investor in ShopRunner, which also offers its cardholders free membership. Beyond the numbers, Thompson says members are widening their spending - in much the same way shoppers patronize adjacent storefronts at the mall. Cross-shopping, when members who start out buying from one or two retailers evolve to shop from more and more, grew nearly 60 percent in 2014, from just under 20 percent previously. \"It's that age-old tenant in the mall that draws customers in, and people around it benefit from the traffic,\" Thompson said. Over the longer term, Thompson hopes to take greater advantage of ties to Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce titan that paid $202 million for 39 percent of the company in 2013. ShopRunner is one of several U.S. e-commerce companies working with Alibaba and affiliate Alipay to help U.S. retailers access China. Through Alipay's nascent \"ePass\" service, which aims to let Chinese customers buy and pay for goods from U.S. retailers hassle-free, ShopRunner helps Neiman Marcus and Cole Haan sell to consumers in China by marketing their brands to buyers there. As Alibaba's biggest single U.S. e-commerce investment, ShopRunner will play a key role in Alipay's effort, although it also has relationships with sites in which Alibaba has no equity holding. Thompson wouldn't give specifics but said ShopRunner's own four-month effort to sell through Alipay was going well and demonstrated the vast potential of a market in which retailers like Best Buy have made little headway despite years of effort. There's some evidence Alibaba's program is taking off. Gilt.com has seen a doubling in sales to China since it started working with Alibaba and Alipay.Wary of attack by activist hedge funds, IBM hires advisers to deal with restless investors: International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) is concerned about a possible attack by prominent activist hedge funds, and is working with two investment banks to formulate a defense plan, according to the people, who declined to be identified. When asked for comment, IBM said: \"IBM is continuing to execute on our strategy - making investments in growth areas such as analytics and cloud, reinventing our core franchises, and returning capital to shareholders. We are managing the company for the long term.\" The storied American technology giant, worth $157 billion today, has struggled to transform itself from a low-margin hardware maker into a cloud-based software and services company. When Virginia Rometty took over as chief executive at the start of 2012, Wall Street was hopeful that she would be able to kickstart growth. Analysts praised the former systems engineer for her strategic thinking in guiding IBM's acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Coopers Consulting in 2002. As revenues continued to decline year on year, however, some IBM investors began to lose confidence management, according to people familiar with the matter. Last year, IBM withdrew its long-term operating earnings target for 2015, and shares of Big Blue are now down about 25 percent from a March 2013 high. Some IBM shareholders are trying to persuade prominent activists to build positions in the company and come up with ways to boost value, people familiar with the matter said. Pershing Square and ValueAct Capital both looked at IBM in recent months, but passed on making a move, the people said. A spokesman for Pershing Square declined to comment. ValueAct did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Part of the activist funds' concern was that IBM, whose stock is trading at around $159, is too expensive and the company's structural problems could not be fixed easily, according to several sources. Another reason, the sources said, is that some investors feel Rometty is doing a good job coping with a tough situation, so she does not fit the role of an underperforming CEO that many activists look for when they make a move.The PayPal Mafia’s Golden Touch: The ride-hailing app Uber, the apartment rental site Airbnb and other darlings of the next generation of Silicon Valley start-ups are reshaping the way people use the web. They are also changing expectations about just how much money private companies can raise while still staying out of the public markets. Known as the unicorns, these private technology companies are worth $1 billion or more, thanks to an influx of cash from venture capital firms, hedge funds, private equity firms and mutual funds. But alongside the Wall Street money flowing into these companies’ coffers, a familiar set of names is operating behind the scenes by advising, investing in and, in some cases, founding the unicorns. The PayPal Mafia — a nickname given a group of alumni of PayPal, the payments company that went public in 2002 and was acquired by eBay — has its hands in many, if not most, of today’s most valuable private tech companies. Their enduring influence, more than a decade after they made their first fortunes, speaks to the tightknit social fabric of Silicon Valley’s technology industry, and to the trust new entrepreneurs place in those who have succeeded before them. And now, the PayPal group’s close ties with the current crop of unicorns — a collection of some of the most valuable technology start-ups ever seen — suggest its influence is undiminished. The shared experience of PayPal alumni makes their advice — and money — particularly valuable to young entrepreneurs. An online payments provider founded in the 1990s, the company succeeded despite going public shortly after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, even as the economy was still reeling from both the attack and the collapse of the dot-com bubble. “PayPal was an extreme experience in survival against all odds, over and over again, with enormous and lasting success,” said Max Levchin, PayPal’s co-founder and chief technology officer. “Like veterans of an intense military campaign, we fall back on lessons learned, and relationships established in our early 20s.”Delta starts accepting payments via Alipay: Delta Air Lines Inc has become the first U.S. airline to accept payments via Alipay, the PayPal-like service run by an Alibaba Group Holding Ltd affiliate that is used by hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers. The airline has started taking payment for flight tickets on delta.com from Alipay's 300 million-plus registered users, Alipay said in a statement on Wednesday. As the largest online payments service in a country where consumer finance remains less-than-fully developed, supporting Alipay - run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial - should make it more convenient for would-be Chinese travelers to buy Delta tickets. That decision underscores the attractiveness to the industry of China, now the world's largest source of outbound tourism after a decade of super-charged economic growth. The U.S. airline has said it wants to be the most Chinese-friendly American carrier.With Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, Samsung Tries to Regain Its Footing: Samsung’s internal code name for its latest top-of-the-line smartphones, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge, is “Project Zero,” signaling what Samsung calls “a return to fundamentals.” The code name also suggests that Samsung finally seems to understand the many criticisms that have long been leveled at its phones: the plastic hardware looked cheap, the most promoted features were mostly useless and the software was too complicated. Samsung, according to Samsung, has realized the errors of it ways. The realization was born out of necessity. Samsung’s market share and profits in the smartphone business have plummeted over the last year. The company, which is based in South Korea, is in the unenviable position of getting squeezed from the bottom by the affordable phones made by Chinese upstarts like Xiaomi and at the top by Apple’s powerhouse line of iPhones. The elegant new Galaxy phones, which went on sale in the United States last week, are aiming to pull Samsung out of that pickle. But while the phones are magnificent to look at, they are most likely not quite enough to fix what ails the company. Despite improved hardware, the S6 and S6 Edge still lack compelling software. Unlike Apple, Samsung has never managed to create a built-in suite of software and services to keep people hooked to its own phones. And there are few obvious ways for Samsung to address this glaring flaw. “You can argue that they’re in phase one of fixing their software, which is getting rid of a lot of the junk,” said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst who anticipated Samsung’s recent troubles. “But we haven’t really seen phase two, which would be building its own stuff. We haven’t really seen much of that so far.”Jack Ma is in India again and met the Indian PM: Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba’s Chairman Jack Ma today met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he came on a visit to India for the second time in just about four months. In his meeting with Modi here today, Ma discussed how Alibaba can help empower small businesses in India, the ecommerce major said without elaborating further. “Had a very good meeting with Jack Ma,” Modi tweeted.Snapdeal buys RupeePower, a financial services marketplace, for an undisclosed sum: Snapdeal.com, has acquired a majority stake in Gurgaon-based digital financial products distribution startup RupeePower for an undisclosed amount, the company said in a statement. Post the acquisition, Snapdeal will offer its customers a financial services marketplace. The marketplace will include a wide range of financial services like personal loans, educational loans, credit cards, auto loans, home loans and extended warranties, etc. Financial services companies will be able to leverage Snapdeal’s nationwide reach across more than 5,000 towns and cities. Founded in 2011, RupeePower matches borrowers and lenders in the retail loans space for products like credit cards, personal loans, home loans, auto loans, and consumer loans. Customers are shown the best loan and card offers for comparison and matched with the bank’s criteria. The service is free for customers and the company gets paid by the financial institution upon loan disbursal. The company claims to have enabled Rs 1,500 crore of credit disbursal through its platform in the current financial year. Snapdeal.com is on a buying spree. Earlier this month, the company bought a minority stake in logistics firm QuickDel Logistics Pvt Ltd, which runs operations under the GoJavas brand. GoJavas was previously a part of Jabong, a lifestyle e-tailer incubated by Rocket Internet. Before that, it had acquired Indian designer wear and accessories e-tailer Exclusively.com (formerly Exclusively.in) for an undisclosed amount. In January 2015, Snapdeal picked up a stake in Smartprix Web Pvt Ltd, which runs online product and price comparison site Smartprix. The e-commerce firm is also expected to close the acquisition of online mobile recharge platform Freecharge for $450 million (Rs 2,800 crore). This is being regarded as the biggest deal in India’s consumer internet industry.After a spectacular start, Apple Pay is beset with problems; survey finds 2/3 of users reported problems: Apple Inc.’s new mobile-payment system is failing to capture all of its potential business, according to a survey, with two-thirds of users reporting problems using the service at the checkout counter.While 66 percent of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus owners surveyed had signed up for Apple Pay, repeat usage is being hurt, the study by Phoenix Marketing International said. Almost half of users visited a store listed as an Apple Pay merchant only to find they couldn’t use the service because the location wasn’t actually accepting the system or wasn’t ready to do so, according to the survey, which drew about 3,000 respondents. “They’ve created demand, but it can’t be fulfilled,” Greg Weed, Phoenix’s director of card research, said in an interview. “To make it more difficult to use or to create any uncertainty in your customer base as to whether it’s going to work is just going to slow it down.” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is relying on the new system to help expand Apple’s reach by offering new services for iPhone users. The biggest U.S. banks and credit-card networks are using Apple Pay to help accelerate U.S. adoption of mobile payments and keep in control of their transactions. At stake is a market that’s likely to process $67 billion worth of sales this year, according to Forrester Research. Apple declined to comment on the survey, which was conducted at the end of February, four months after Apple Pay was introduced. Apple Pay, which uses short-range wireless signals known as near-field communication, essentially turns an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus into a digital wallet. The system works only at stores that have upgraded their cash registers to accept chip-embedded credit cards. It’s now supported by 2,500 banks in the U.S. and about 700,000 locations accept it, Cook said this month. “It’s gotten off to the most amazing start,” Cook said at an event to unveil features of the company’s Apple Watch. Samsung Electronics Co. earlier this month unveiled its own mobile-transaction system, Samsung Pay, which will be available in the third quarter in the U.S. and South Korea. The technology works at checkout terminals that use older, magnetic-stripe technology, as well as NFC. Google Inc., which already has a mobile wallet, has also said it plans to expand in the business and is working on a new service called Android Pay. The average Apple Pay user made 2.6 in-store transactions using the system in its first four months, the survey by Rhinebeck, New York-based Phoenix found. Almost half used it to purchase something inside an Apple store, while almost a third used it at Macy’s Inc. Thirty-six percent of Apple Pay customers used it at McDonald’s Corp. The majority of people who used Apple Pay said they did so because it was faster than a traditional credit card. Almost 60 percent they were using it because “it’s new, stylish or cool,” while 58 percent said they thought it was safer than a normal credit card. About half of users said it was good for medium-sized purchases. Of the problems that occurred at merchants, 48 percent of those surveyed said it took too long to record the transaction, while 42 percent said the cashier was unfamiliar with Apple Pay and unable to help. Other complaints included transactions that incorrectly posted, or were counted twice. The complaints are just some of the challenges Apple faces as it brings out a new payment system. Apple Pay has also been hit by fraud. Some banks have made changes in how they activate customers’ credit-card accounts after reports that criminals were typing stolen credit-card numbers into Apple Pay and trying to make purchases with their iPhones. Some issuers have found that up to 8 percent of Apple Pay transactions were fraudulent, compared with 0.1 percent on traditional payments cards, said Julie Conroy, an analyst at Aite Group.GoDaddy Said to Price I.P.O. Above Expected Range: Nearly four years ago, GoDaddy was an Internet registration company with a history of risqué advertising. Now, as it prepares for new life on the public stock markets, the company is eager to let everyone know that it does a lot more than register website addresses — and doesn’t rely on racy commercials with scantily clad spokeswomen, either. That new vision of GoDaddy appeared to resonate with investors. The company raised $440 million after pricing its initial public offering at $20 a share late Tuesday, above its expected range of $17 to $19 a share, according to a person close to the transaction. At that price, the company has a market value of just more than $3 billion. Under the ownership of the investment firms that bought the company in 2011 for about $2.25 billion — Silver Lake, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Technology Crossover Ventures — GoDaddy has sought to transcend its long-established roots and promote itself as the guide to the Internet for small business. That is a much bigger vision than the one the company had when it was founded in 1997 by Bob Parsons as a way for customers to register domain names and host websites. Eventually, it became the biggest Internet registrar, thanks in large part to Mr. Parsons’s unabashedly attention-seeking advertising, which frequently revolved around spokeswomen like the racecar driver Danica Patrick. Among GoDaddy’s most familiar tactics was creating versions of Super Bowl commercials that would never be shown on broadcast television. After the company’s new owners took over, the business tried to change its tone along with its business model. The private equity firms brought in Blake Irving, a former chief product officer at Yahoo, to help transform GoDaddy into what it described in its I.P.O. prospectus as “a leading technology provider to small businesses.” Internet site registration remains GoDaddy’s biggest source of revenue, accounting for just more than half of its sales last year. According to the prospectus, the company now oversees 59 million domains, or about 21 percent of those worldwide. Website hosting services and tools, a natural complement to the domain business, made up 39 percent of its bookings last year. The company believes it still has room to grow in its main market. A study it commissioned found that more than 50 percent of American small businesses did not have a website as of early 2013. But GoDaddy has also become one of the biggest resellers of Microsoft’s Office 365 suite of productivity and email services, with that operation making up about 10 percent of its sales last year. GoDaddy has also expanded abroad, going from one English-language website to an array of offerings in 37 countries and 17 languages. About one-quarter of its revenue now comes from international business. Over all, the company’s sales have climbed consistently in the last three years, up to nearly $1.4 billion in 2014. It lost $143.3 million during that period, according to generally accepted accounting principles, though the company points to what it calls adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, which strips out certain accounting charges. Using that measurement, GoDaddy earned $271.5 million.Alibaba Signs Distribution Deal With BMG, Its First Music Partner Outside Of Asia: (more here) In a bid to increase its online entertainment offerings, Alibaba has struck an agreement with music publisher BMG, which gives it access to over 2.5 million tracks. The partnership is notable because it represents the first time Alibaba’s digital entertainment unit has signed with a music partner outside of Asia. The business already has agreements with Taiwanese music companies Rock Records and HIM International Music. The deal gives Alibaba access to BMG’s catalog, which includes tracks from Bruno Mars, the Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, and Kylie Minogue. Music will be made available to consumers through streaming apps Xiami and TTPod, both of which are operated by Alibaba’s digital entertainment business. It’s important to remember that Alibaba is more than just an e-commerce company. It is also one of China’s biggest mobile Internet players, competing head-to-head with Tencent, which has already struck similar arrangements with Warner Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment. Alibaba’s growth plans include selling other online services to the huge user base it has grown by operating China’s top e-commerce platforms and online payment service Alipay. Streaming music is a potential growth market for Chinese Internet companies, but only if they succeed in dealing with piracy. According to the Financial Times, China accounted for less than one percent of the $15 billion in global revenues made in 2013 by record companies, in part because pirated tracks are easy to obtain. The government, however, has begun to crackdown on copyright infringement, and deals like the ones Alibaba and Tencent have struck with BMG, Warner Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment give music publishers more power over their IP in China. In a statement, Alibaba said “the agreement will not only significantly boost earnings by BMG artists and writers from the world’s most populous nation, but also give them a powerful ally in hleping grow the legitimate music market in China.” This means that Alibaba will help BMG keep an eye on pirated music and work with them to take legal action against services that are using tracks that violate BMG’s copyright.US Health Regulator FDA 'Taking a Very Light Touch' on Regulating the Apple Watch: Bakul Patel, who oversees the new wave of consumer-focused health products at the Food and Drug Administration, said most wearable gadgets such as the soon-to-be-released Apple Watch and health-focused applications for smartphones have a way to go before warranting close scrutiny from the agency. \"We are taking a very light touch, an almost hands-off approach,\" Patel, the FDA's associate director for digital health, said in an interview. \"If you have technology that's going to motivate a person to stay healthy, that's not something we want to be engaged in.\" The FDA is mapping out its role at a time when health care and consumer technology are blending. Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and other companies are building products loaded with sensors that have the potential to eventually gather all sorts of information about blood pressure, body temperature, glucose levels, hydration, oxygen levels and outside air conditions. Software algorithms are being developed that gather different information about a person's health to provide a diagnosis of potential illness that backers say may eventually be more accurate than a doctor. Some products raised flags with regulators after they've reached the market. In February, the Federal Trade Commission cracked down on some smartphone apps for dubiously claiming to diagnose melanoma based on an uploaded picture. Meanwhile, the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights is responsible for oversight of the security of patient-health data collected by electronic devices, a separate issue that is being closely watched by privacy advocates. \"I worry that there are going to be companies that are skirting the rules,\" Gandhi said. \"We have to see the enforcement, otherwise it creates a very uneven playing field between companies that are acting ethically and those that aren't.\" Patel said Apple and Google Inc. and other corporations should play a role in screening applications to be sure health-software developers aren't over-promising the benefits of their products. Both companies have visited FDA headquarters in Maryland to discuss their health initiatives, he said.GitHub has been battling a DoS attack for days - alleged source of attack: China: U.S. coding site GitHub said on Sunday that it was deflecting most of the traffic from a days-long cyber attack that had caused intermittent outages for the social coding site, with the Wall Street Journal citing China as the source of the attack. \"Eighty-seven hours in, our mitigation is deflecting most attack traffic. We're aware of intermittent issues and continue to adapt our response,\" a tweet from the GitHub Status account said. The attack took the form of a flood of traffic, known as a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack. Those kinds of attacks are among the most common on the Internet. The Wall Street Journal reported that the flood of Internet traffic to GitHub came from Chinese search engine Baidu Inc, targeting two GitHub pages that linked to copies of sites that are banned in China. On its blog, GitHub said that the attack began early on Thursday \"and involves a wide combination of attack vectors.\" \"These include every vector we've seen in previous attacks as well as some sophisticated new techniques that use the web browsers of unsuspecting, uninvolved people to flood github.com with high levels of traffic,\" the blog post continued. \"Based on reports we've received, we believe the intent of this attack is to convince us to remove a specific class of content.\" GitHub supplies social coding tools for developers and calls itself the world's largest code host. A Beijing-based Baidu spokesman said the company had conducted a thorough investigation and found that it was neither a security problem on Baidu's side nor a hacking attack. \"We have notified other security organizations and are working to get to the bottom of this,\" the spokesman said.India's capital markets regulator Sebi on listing norms for start-ups: SEBI is likely to put out a discussion paper on the listing norms for start-ups next week. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) Chairman U K Sinha today met an eight-member team from start-up think-tank iSpirt Foundation here to discuss the way forward for start-ups to raise funds from the primary markets. “Sebi would put out a discussion paper next week suggesting a series of improvements. The first draft guidelines are expected by the end of June,” iSpirt Foundation co-founder and governing council member Sharad Sharma told PTI. The think-tank has been in touch with Sebi since mid-December to facilitate the rapidly burgeoning start-up space to go public and raise funds. “This will stop the exodus of start-ups that choose to list on international markets currently,” Sharma said. He, however, declined to comment on the contents of the discussion paper. At the last meeting with Sebi on December 19 last year, the industry had sought regulatory intervention in easing the existing regulations and guidelines which make it difficult for companies to get right investors and advisors. Another suggestion was to make the listing process faster and easier so that investors could exit. Minutes of the past meeting with Sebi posted on the thinktank’s website say the Sebi chairman had indicated that the regulator was exploring putting in place a framework for crowd-funding which will provide a much-needed new mode of financing for start-ups and SME sector and increase flow of credit to SMEs and other users in the real economy. In this mode, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups will be able to raise funds at a lower cost of capital without going through rigorous procedures.Lyft Adds Profiles to Make Ride Sharing More Personalized: Unlike Uber, the giant ride-hailing start-up with its powerful name and sleek, black-and-silver branding, Lyft has gone for a warmer, fuzzier exterior. Lyft drivers eschew fit and finish for large, pink dashboard mustaches to identify themselves. The company encourages lively conversation between passengers and drivers. It is, to some degree, a kinder, gentler and perhaps more convivial form of taking an Uber car. Expect more of the same in the future. On Thursday, Lyft plans to add user profiles for drivers and passengers to its app, essentially adding another personal touch to the act of taking a ride somewhere. The additions are not extreme. People are asked to provide their hometown, music tastes or other things about themselves that may be interesting topics of conversation. If a user has connected their Facebook account, the Lyft app can show if drivers and passengers have mutual friends in common. “It’s our first step on the road map to personalizing that in-car experience,” said Tali Rapaport, vice president of product at Lyft, who was tasked with creating the profiles. The feature is entirely optional, and users aren’t forced to turn it on. Part of the exercise is certainly branding. Lyft recently brought on Kira Wampler, a former executive at Trulia, to be its chief marketing officer. Since joining in December, Ms. Wampler has helped revamp Lyft’s image, swapping the furry mustaches that Lyft drivers stuck to their cars with the “glowstache,” a luminescent replica that sits atop a driver’s dashboard so that passengers can spot their rides. But profiles speak to Lyft’s broad vision of the company. Lyft is pushing Line, its car pool product, as the future of the company, one where there’s a “butt in every seat,” as Ms. Rapaport put it. Instead of hailing a personal car, calling a Lyft Line offers passengers a discount for picking up one or two more people who are traveling along a similar route. As they travel the route, passengers are dropped off at different points along the way. Passengers save money and, in theory, net income goes up for both Lyft and the driver. Lyft’s ideal version of the future is to have as many people using Lyft Line as possible, cutting down on the number of cars on the road. So an addition like user profiles, however small, may make the experience of traveling by car pool more enjoyable. Topics of conversation are easily available, for instance, or a driver may play a track from a passenger’s favorite band. “When you build a product that touches millions of people, it should be human, not transactional,” said John Zimmer, co-founder and president of Lyft.Late to streaming - Apple finally developing streaming music service to rival Spotify: In what would be the biggest change to its music strategy in years, Apple is pressing ahead with a sweeping overhaul of its digital music services that would allow the company to compete directly with streaming upstarts like Spotify. Almost a year after agreeing to pay $3 billion for Beats, the maker of hip headphones and a streaming music service, Apple is working with Beats engineers and executives to introduce its own subscription streaming service. The company is also planning an enhanced iTunes Radio that may be tailored to listeners in regional markets, and, if Apple gets what it wants, more splashy new albums that will be on iTunes before they are available anywhere else, according to people briefed on the company’s plans. In a sign of how important Beats is in reshaping Apple’s digital music, the company has made a musician a point man for overhauling the iPhone’s music app to include the streaming music service, as opposed to an engineer. Trent Reznor, the Nine Inch Nails frontman who was the chief creative officer for Beats, is playing a major role in redesigning the music app, according to two Apple employees familiar with the product, who spoke on the condition they not be named because the plans are private. Perhaps most telling for Apple is what its new streaming service will not have: a lower price than rival services. According to several music executives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks are private, Apple recently tried but failed to persuade record labels to agree to lower licensing costs that would have let Apple sell subscriptions to its streaming service for $8 a month — a discount from the $10 that has become standard for services like Spotify, Rhapsody and Rdio. That $2 markdown may be small, but Apple’s failure to secure it reflects a shift in the company’s relationship with the music industry. While Apple once enjoyed enormous negotiating power as the dominant force in digital music — an area it helped pioneer more than a decade ago with music downloads — it now faces an array of new competitors and finds itself in the position of needing to modernize its offerings to catch up to the streaming revolution. That has weakened Apple’s leverage — and the labels could not be happier about it. Apple’s turn toward streaming is a matter of necessity, as listeners increasingly shift from music downloads to streaming. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, downloads generated $2.6 billion in revenue in 2014, down 8.5 percent from the year before. Streaming made $1.87 billion last year, and overtook CD sales for the first time. As the biggest retailer of music, Apple remains a crucial marketing partner for the music industry. Yet its absence from streaming has let others get a head start. Spotify, which started in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States in 2011, said in January that it has 15 million paying subscribers around the world, as well as 45 million more who listen free, with advertising. (Apple’s iTunes has more than 800 million customer accounts.)Questions arise as bankrupt RadioShack seeks to sell trove of customer data. After filing for bankruptcy in early February, RadioShack is currently making its way through the painful process of  figuring out how creditors will be paid back -- auctioning off real estate and trademarks. Also on the list is more than 13 million e-mail addresses and 65 million customer names and physical addresses -- as well as potential information about customers shopping habits. How much that data could be worth to a buyer is still unclear, but the proposed sale is drawing protests from consumer advocates and raising potentially disturbing questions about how data about shoppers is handled. In the Internet Age, people leave a near constant trail of digital bread crumbs about their lives. And it's clear that data has value: The entire online advertising industry is based on collecting it. But what happens if a company that has amassed a huge trove of data on nearly every aspect of a person's life gets sold off for parts? Radio Shack declined to comment about its bankruptcy's process. The company was a pioneer in collecting customer data, said Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"Radio Shack was the first company that routinely asked for phone numbers. The privacy policy was critical to maintain consumer confidence,\" he said. And in its privacy policy, RadioShack told customers that it wouldn't sell or rent their personally identifiable information to third parties -- which should make this a pretty clear issue, Rotenberg said. But as Bloomberg News noted, a Web site for Hilco Streambank, a company serving as an intermediary for RadioShack in the bankruptcy process, listed the retailer's \"customer databases\" as among the assets for sale. Hedge fund and RadioShack creditor Standard General won an auction for the company's assets, according to Bloomberg. But the deal must still be approved by a bankruptcy court in Delaware and is facing several challenges. Back in 2000, after the dot-com bubble burst, the FTC sued to stop Toysmart.com from selling off customer data in violation of its privacy policy. In that case, the FTC said that data in question included names, addresses, billing information, shopping preferences and family profiles,  including the names and birth dates of children. The data was eventually destroyed. The FTC has also sent letters about proposed data sales in the bankruptcies of other companies, including Borders, XY Magazine, and ConnectEDU.Alibaba's money-market fund ended 2014 with $93B in AUM, but its phase of explosive growth might be over: Ant Financial, Alibaba’s affiliated financial branch, revealed a few benchmark numbers for Yu’ebao, the company’s consumer-facing money-market fund. By the end of 2014, Yu’ebao’s user count hit 185 million, up more than four times the previous year’s count of 43 million. The fund’s worth in assets reached RMB 578.93 billion (about US$93 billion) by the year’s end, marking a 200 percent annual increase. Ant financial also claims that Yu’ebao’s funds generated RMB 24 billion (about US$3.8 billion) in value by year’s end, amounting to RMB 139 per person. While these numbers appear massive from a birds-eye view, not all is peachy keen for Yu’ebao. The fund’s size shrunk to about US$87 million last autumn, and while these latest numbers appear to show a rebound, its days of rocket growth seem to be over. Yu’ebao is the shell and banner for a money market fund run by Tianhong Asset Management. Alibaba’s Ant Financial purchased a majority stake in Tianhong in late 2013 for a reported US$192 million. Yu’ebao is accessible directly in Alipay Wallet, the mobile app for Alipay, Alibaba’s third-party payment software. Yu’ebao marks Alibaba founder Jack Ma’s attempt to enter consumer banking. In the past, the ecommerce mogul has been vocal about his disdain for China’s banking industry, wherein banks typically give consumers low interest rates for opening savings accounts. China’s tech giants don’t like to get one-upped, and other leading internet firms have also opened money-market funds similar to Yu’ebao. Tencent operates Licaitong, an analogous money market fund, and recently opened what has been described as China’s first “internet bank.” Baidu also has its hat in the ring, as does Xiaomi, which recently launched a money-market fund in beta.Uber, Ola stare at a possible IP address block in India: (more here) The Delhi government has asked India’s information technology ministry to block the taxi-hailing apps of Uber and Ola in the national capital, news agency Reuters reports, quoting an unnamed government official. Yesterday, Delhi transport officials asked Uber and Ola to cease operations if they want their applications for radio taxi licenses to be processed. The officials had earlier asked the central government to block Uber’s IP address in India if the company does not abide by the law on running taxis. A block of the IP address would prevent passengers and drivers from accessing the app. Now, Ola too seems to be caught in this regulatory fix. Taxi-hailing apps hit a roadblock in India when an Uber driver raped a passenger in Delhi three months ago. This led to a ban in several Indian cities, and a close scrutiny of safety measures, driver screening, and liabilities that these ride-hailing companies assume. Uber had given in to a transport authority demand to apply for a radio taxi license in India, after initially insisting that it is not a radio taxi company. But its application fell short of what was required. The bone of contention is Uber’s insistence that it is just an internet platform connecting owners and drivers of cars with their customers, while regulators are equally insistent that it has to follow rules like any other taxi service. The transport authority refused to give a license to Uber unless it met the licensing conditions. On its part, Uber said it is “evaluating the perceived deficiencies in the time period provided to us by the government.” Uber tied up with First Advantage to do background checking of its drivers and included two new panic buttons on the Uber app – only in India – to persuade consumers and authorities that it is serious about safety. Earlier this week, it got into a “commercial marketing arrangement” with The Times of India Group to help ease its rollout across India.Tinder hacked, results in matches of unaware straight men, odd conversations: Flirting can be hard, especially through a screen. But these guys never had a chance, considering they were chatting with other heterosexual male users as part of a clever technological ruse. A hack on Tinder isn’t anything new. More tech-savvy folks have actually dug into the app to automatically swipe right on every potential match, and then there are all the marketers that are tricking folks into chatting with a brand instead of a human. But the Verge reports that a hacker recently set up a program that would use female dummy accounts to put heterosexual men into conversations with each other. Using Tinder’s API, the programmer was able to channel messages from one unknowing man to another, with both parties in the conversation believing instead that they were talking to a woman.Google hired Morgan Stanley's CFO to succeed Patrick Pichette as its new CFO: Google said it hired Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer, to succeed Patrick Pichette as its new CFO in May. Porat, 57, will leave Morgan Stanley in April after 28 years at the firm, the New York-based company said Tuesday in a memo to employees. Jonathan Pruzan, 46, co-head of global financial institutions banking, will become Morgan Stanley’s new CFO. Porat, one of Wall Street’s most senior female executives, pivots from a job in which she built up cash reserves for safety to one where she must figure out how to use Google’s growing cash pile. In five years as Morgan Stanley’s CFO, the Stanford University alumna has helped stabilize an investment bank that almost collapsed in 2008. “I’m delighted to be returning to my California roots and joining Google,” Porat said in a statement released by the Mountain View, California-based Internet company. “Growing up in Silicon Valley, during my time at Morgan Stanley and as a member of Stanford’s board, I’ve had the opportunity to experience first-hand how tech companies can help people in their daily lives. I can’t wait to roll up my sleeves and get started.”Silicon Valley has tapped Wall Street bankers to help them manage the finances associated with their rapid growth. Twitter Inc. last year named Anthony Noto, 46, previously Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s co-head of technology, media and telecommunications banking, as its CFO.TPG-backed AGS Transact plans up to $216.6 million India IPO: India's AGS Transact Technologies, partly owned by U.S. private equity firm TPG Capital [TPG.UL], plans an up to 13.5 billion rupees ($216.6 million) initial public offering, according to a term sheet of the deal seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The company plans to raise up to 4 billion rupees by issuing new shares, while TPG and other shareholders would raise up to 9.5 billion rupees selling existing shares in AGS, which offers payment solutions and technology products to banks and retailers, the terms showed.Accel announces $305M India fund, joins large tech investors accelerating India-focuse activity: Accel Partners has just announced a new US$305 million fund for India to invest in very early stage companies as well as those already in the growth trajectory. “The investment focus area will cover consumer, enterprise software, mobile, and healthcare businesses,” Subrata Mitra, partner with the VC firm, wrote on the company blog. This is Accel’s fourth fund for India. Accel has a star-studded portfolio of companies in India, including ecommerce major Flipkart, analytics company MuSigma, and cloud-based customer support provider Freshdesk. Since its Indian entry in 2005, it has had a few successful exits as well, including Myntra, which was acquired by Flipkart, TaxiForSure, which was acquired by Ola, and Virident, which was acquired by Western Digital. The venture capital flow into India moved to a new orbit last year, with nearly US$5 billion of startup funding. A number of big players have been pumping money into India. The leader of the pack is Tiger Global, the lead investor in Flipkart, which raised a whopping US$1.7 billion in 2014 alone. Tiger Global raised US$4 billion in two rounds last year, and a substantial portion of that can be expected to come to India. Sequoia is another big player from Silicon Valley, which raised a US$530 million India-focused fund last year. India-based VCs too are pulling in big bucks. Earlier this month, Saif Partners raised a US$350 million fund, and late last year, Lightbox VC raised a second fund of US$100 million. Investors focused on just the early stage startups have also been successful in raising money for India. 500 Startups and Blume Ventures have recently raised their second funds. There is growing interest from the east as well. SoftBank of Japan made three big investments last year in Snapdeal, Ola, and Housing. What’s more, it has pledged an investment of US$10 billion into India over the next few years. The rapid spread of smartphone and internet usage in a large population is one of the main factors making Indian tech startups attractive. An improvement in economic sentiment following the change in government is also making India the place to go for venture capital investors.Slack said to be in talks to raise money at more than $2B valuation: Slack, the San Francisco start-up that makes a​ workplace collaboration app, is back on the fund-raising trail and is​ in talks to​ rais​e money at a valuation of more than $2 billion, according to ​a person familiar with the matter. The talks come just four months after Slack, which is run by the entrepreneur Stewart Butterfield, raised $120 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion. The valuation could change because the talks are still occurring, according to this ​person, who requested anonymity because of continuing ties to the company. ​But the talks are another reflection of how Silicon Valley start-ups have been raising money at a furious pace, often snagging tens of millions of dollars and more than doubling their value just months after a previous financing round. Uber, the hugely popular ride-hailing app, has raised billions of dollars in little more than two years. Snapchat, a messaging start-up, has raised hundreds of millions in very short order as well. Bloomberg News earlier reported Slack’s new fund-raising. Mr. Butterfield declined a request for comment. In a recent interview, Mr. Butterfield acknowledged that Slack has “a lot of money and not a lot to spend on,” though he added the company is planning to increase its spending on marketing. The company employs just over 100 people. ​To date, Slack has raised about $180 million from firms such as Google Ventures, Accel Partners and Andreessen Horowitz, among others. Mr. Butterfield has been tossing around the idea of leasing a small storefront in one of San Francisco’s prime retail hotspots. A store, which might cost about $15,000 to $20,000 a month, could work as a public help desk for Slack’s rising number of users. It would also work to market the brand to new users. Slack was introduced about a year ago by Mr. Butterfield and now serves about half a million workers every day, who use the app as a kind of replacement for email and instant messaging. The company offers a free version of its product and also charges companies a monthly fee of $6.50 or more for each user if they want additional features. Mr. Butterfield recently said Slack wasn’t profitable and that its losses totaled “a couple hundred thousand dollars a month.”​Apple acquires NoSQL provider FoundationDB to bolster its server-side cloud technology: Apple has acquired FoundationDB, a company that specializes in speedy, durable NoSQL databases, TechCrunch has learned. A notice on the FoundationDB site notes that it’s no longer offering downloads of its database software. Financial terms of the deal were not available. CEO David Rosenthal was previously VP of Engineering at Omniture and co-founded the company with COO Nick Lavezzo and Dave Scherer in 2009. FoundationDB’s attractiveness came in the speed at which it handled ACID-compliant transactions and coupled that with strong scalability. FoundationDB hosted a booth at TechCrunch Disrupt SF in 2012, where we first wrote about its approach to a modern NoSQL database and its ‘NoSQL, YesACID’ motto. FoundationDB’s latest engine, which was covered by TC Columnist Jon Evans late last year, scaled up 14.4 million random writes per second. imag1829 A FoundationDB blog post on its newest engine made the following claim: At current (December 2014) AWS (non-spot) pricing and including enterprise FoundationDB licenses for all 480 cores with full 24/7 support this mega-cluster only costs about $150/hr. In that same hour this cluster will achieve 54 billion writes, yielding a cost-per-write of 3 nanodollars. Said another way, FoundationDB can do 3.6 million database writes per penny. So. A fast, affordable and durable database company, acquired by Apple. It seems likely that this was an acquisition designed to bolster Apple’s server-side technologies for the App Store, iTunes Connect or iTunes in the Cloud. With millions of apps now in the store and billions being served to users, there is undoubtedly room for improvement in those systems. Of course, there is always Apple’s rumored over-the-top TV service, which some reports claim is coming our way later this year. The need to be able to serve video at scale there will likely require bolstering systems, as we discussed with the head of media at the MLB just this week. The reliability and speed of Apple’s cloud services are more critical than ever now that it has shipped 700 million iPhones alone — along with millions more iPads and Macs — all of which use iCloud.Uber Sells $24M Stake to India’s Times Group in Marketing Deal: Uber Technologies Inc. said the publisher of India’s most-read English newspaper has taken a small stake in the ride-hailing application company as part of a strategic partnership to support its expansion. The investment made by Times Internet is worth about 1.5 billion rupees ($24 million), the Indian company said in an e-mailed reply to a question. The Economic Times newspaper, also published by Bennett, Coleman, had first reported the value of the deal citing people familiar with the transaction. The deal with Times Internet Ltd. will help increase the marketing and distribution of Uber’s services to more than 200 million consumers in India, the San Francisco-based company said in a statement on its blog, without giving details of the investment. Times Internet is a fully owned unit of Bennett, Coleman & Co., the flagship company of the Times of India Group and publisher of The Times of India newspaper. Uber counts India as its biggest market outside the U.S. and the fastest growing globally. Baidu Inc., China’s largest Internet search engine, in December agreed to invest in Uber and said the company will connect its map and mobile-search features with the ride-hailing service. Uber’s service is available in 11 Indian cities and offers three types of cars, including hatchbacks for as little as 7 rupees (11 cents) a kilometer.Chinese city Hangzhou cracks down on Taobao seller-on-seller dirty tricks: China’s online ecommerce market is massive, but it’s also kind of a jungle. Especially in the C2C wilderness that is Taobao, shop owners use all kinds of shady tactics like brushing to make sure they get the sale, whether or not the consumer is actually getting what they want. Now Hangzhou, they city that plays host to Alibaba HQ, has passed a new set of regulations on ecommerce transactions that makes behavior like that illegal and punishable by local authorities. The new regulations will require Hangzhou sellers to register as businesses with the ecommerce platform they use, and levy fines of RMB 10,000 to RMB 30,000 (US$1,600-4,800) on platforms that don’t collect the proper information. Sellers can also be fined between RMB 10,000 to RMB 30,000 for doing any of the following: (1) Using the name or trademark of a famous company, product, brand, person, social organization, or government organization without permission (2) Leave negative reviews for, slander, or falsely report rival sellers and shops (3) Buying products in bulk and then returning all of them or refusing to accept delivery to harm rival shopkeepers’ profits (4) Falsifying internet transactions [like “brushing”] to get good reviews (5) Using technological measures to interfere with search rankings (6) Releasing fake products or false service information Harming national interests, public interests, or the lawful rights of others (6) Additionally, sellers can be fined between RMB 2,000 and RMB 20,000 (US$320-3,200) if they engage in any kind of customer harassment like calling customers who left negative reviews and berating or threatening them until they change their review score. Because these laws were passed by the city of Hangzhou and not China’s national government, they don’t apply to all online sellers yet. But they certainly provide a window into the kinds of dirty tricks that some Chinese C2C shopkeeps go in for, and the dangers consumers still face when shopping on C2C marketplaces like Taobao.Apple Pay’s pitch: Simpler is better. But some security experts disagree. When Apple introduced its pay-by-smartphone feature last fall, the company touted the simplicity of the setup. All shoppers needed to do was wave their iPhones in front of a special scanner at the cash register — no need to fumble through pockets and purses for plastic cards or identification. But a sharp rise in reports of fraudulent Apple Pay transactions is raising questions about the security of the first mobile payment system to find a measure of popular success. One payments analyst, Cherian Abraham, estimated that as many as 6 percent of Apple Pay purchases are completed with stolen credit cards, or 60 times the rate of the old-fashioned plastic swipe. The problem is that Apple Pay may be too simple to set up, security analysts said. Fraudsters have been loading stolen cards onto iPhones to buy things at stores. As it turns out, it might have been better if Apple Pay required users to do more to prove their identities when they sign up for the service, these experts said. The balance between security and ease of use has long bedeviled technologists, especially those pushing for a new payment system to replace the plastic cards that are highly vulnerable to thieves. That need has grown more urgent as credit card hacks — such as those that have afflicted Target and Home Depot in recent years — have risen in scope and frequency. Mobile payments offer a potential solution. They are considered much harder to hack than traditional payment systems. And they avoid the swipe — a critical advancement since a lot of credit card numbers are stolen by fake card readers. But consumers, banks and retailers have been slow to embrace the technology, partly because of its complexity. Launched in October, Apple Pay was billed as simple to use, and the universe of stores and banks accepting the service has been growing steadily over the past few months. Apple boasts that Apple Pay is now accepted at hundreds of thousands of store locations. Bank of America said customers added 1.1 million of its credit and debit cards to Apple devices in the first two months of Apple Pay. JPMorgan Chase cited a similar figure. But reports of fraud are now giving retailers and banks some pause. “The issuers were probably so eager to be involved that they kind of forgot best practices and sidestepped some procedures they normally would’ve had [in order] to accept Apple Pay,” said Michelle Evans, senior analyst for consumer finance at market research firm Euromonitor.China's tax environment is tightening - regulator to reap Alibaba windfall as tightens up on tax: China could make billions of dollars from taxing gains made by employees of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA.N) who are free to sell their shares for the first time since its IPO, as the country tightens up its leaky mechanisms for tax collection. On Wednesday, a six-month lock-up period for the recently New York-listed stock expired, allowing insiders who bought 437 million shares prior to the IPO to sell their stock, though 100 million of them are subject to trading restrictions that apply to employees until the company reports results in May. The total lock-up represents roughly 18 percent of Alibaba's shares, which if sold would fetch just over $37 billion at Friday's closing price. Although Alibaba did not disclose the identity of the shareholders subject to the lock-up, many will be taxable in China, where most of its 22,000 people are employed, and its share scheme is subject to a number of controls that will help ensure China gets its tax. Current and former employees hold around 26.7 percent of the company, having built up holdings through stock options and other incentives since 1999, according to a Reuters report from June using IPO securities filings. Those subject to the expiring lock-up will have obtained their shares at different times and costs, so the gains figure is unknown, but the tax is expected to reach billions of dollars for China's State Administration of Taxation (SAT). While tax on employee compensation is withheld by employers, tax on share sales must be declared by employees, meaning it's typically harder for the authorities to track. It is not uncommon for employees participating in Chinese company stock incentive schemes to transfer their shares to offshore trusts in the Cayman or British Virgin Islands to avoid tax, according to a person who helps create such structures. But Alibaba's newly minted millionaires won't escape the gaze of the tax inspector, said a Beijing-based accountant. \"Because it was such a large IPO, the tax bureau will for sure be monitoring that.\" While the potential tax windfall is tiny relative to China's total fiscal revenue of 14 trillion yuan ($2.26 trillion) last year, it reflects the government's more rigorous stance on tax.Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock, all giant US money managers, are adding Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and other private tech investments to mainstream portfolios: Tech Money Sends Funds on the Hunt for Unicorns: The retirement accounts of millions of Americans have long contained shares of stalwart companies like General Electric, Ford and Coca-Cola. Today, they are likely to include riskier private stocks from Silicon Valley start-ups like Uber, Airbnb and Pinterest. Big money managers including Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price and BlackRock have all struck deals worth billions of dollars to acquire shares of these private companies that are then pooled into mutual funds that go into the 401(k)’s and individual retirement accounts of many Americans. With private tech companies growing faster than companies on the stock market, the money managers are aiming to get a piece of the action. Fidelity’s Contrafund includes $204 million in Pinterest shares, $162 million in Uber shares, and $24 million in Airbnb shares. Over all, there were 29 deals last year in which a mutual fund bought into a private company, and they were worth a collective $4.7 billion, according to CB Insights. That was up from six such deals, worth a combined $296 million, in 2012. T. Rowe Price was the most active big investor, making 17 investments in private tech companies. Because these tech companies are not required to issue financial reports and are not traded on traditional exchanges, they are the sort of speculative investments not normally found in retirement accounts. Increasingly, however, investors are betting that these companies will be bought or go public at prices that exceed their latest funding rounds, a prospect that is anything but guaranteed. “I think it goes beyond what mutual funds were set up to do,” said Leonard Rosenthal, a professor of finance at Bentley University in Waltham, Mass. “It’s great for the portfolio manager, but it’s not necessarily in the interest of the shareholders of the fund. If investors are looking for a portfolio of risky securities, there are plenty of stocks to trade in the public market.” The dilemma for big fund managers is that fast-growing technology companies are so reluctant to sell private stock to the public that there is now a term — “unicorns,” reflecting just how wonderful and magical they are considered to be — for the dozens of private firms worth $1 billion or more. Several, including the ride-hailing company Uber, the room rental site Airbnb and the digital scrapbook Pinterest are worth more than $10 billion. Those lofty valuations, combined with the eagerness investors show in bidding them up, have created a shadowy market for private stock issued to tech companies’ early investors and employees. For the last few years, mutual funds have sat on the sidelines. Now, they are racing to get in. “More and more, the big lopsided growth is happening away from the public markets,” said Andrew Boyd, head of global capital equity markets at Fidelity. Take Uber, which was valued around $40 billion in its latest round of financing, up from $3.5 billion in mid-2013. That is more than 1,000 percent growth, compared with 28 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index over the same time period.Shoppers on Lazada last year spent $350 million as ecommerce booms in Southeast Asia: Rocket Internet’s Amazon-esque Lazada saw more than US$350 million in consumer purchases in 2014, group CEO Maximillian Bittner tells Tech in Asia. US$70 million of that spending (termed gross merchandise volume, or GMV) happened in December alone, due to Christmas and special promotions like the 12/12 sales day. The 2014 spending tally represents strong growth for Lazada from US$89 million in 2013. Lazada is this week celebrating its third anniversary. It operates in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Lazada started out doing only direct sales to consumers from its own warehouses, but that changed in the fall of 2013 as the company launched a marketplace for third-party merchants. Those merchants now take in 70 to 75 percent of the consumer spending on the estore, Bittner reveals. They’re a “core driver of growth” on Lazada, he adds. There are now 15,000 merchants using the site as an online storefront. “It’s not a target to be a 100 percent marketplace,” Bittner emphasizes. “It depends on the best price for consumers” and other factors such as whether Lazada itself or third-party merchants have better purchasing power. Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s largest single market, and Bittner says the archipelago is the top market for Lazada. Indonesia’s shoppers made up over 30 percent of Lazada’s 2014 spending tally. While Indonesia has an array of homegrown rivals to Lazada – from well-funded Tokopedia to the new Matahari Mall – Bittner says the nation is not necessarily a tougher market than the other Southeast Asian countries. “There’s a growing dynamic of excitement” about Indonesia’s ecommerce scene right now, adds Bittner. He adds that exclusive online gadget sales for brands like Xiaomi and Motorola have helped Lazada greatly in Indonesia. Xiaomi uses Lazada as its sole sales channel in both Indonesia and the Philippines.Hackers Attack GreatFire.org, a Workaround for Websites Censored in China: For years, a group of anonymous activists known as GreatFire.org has monitored online censorship in China, provided access to blocked websites and collected messages deleted by censors. This week, unidentified hackers have tried to put an end to those activists’ efforts with an unprecedented attack. In a post to its blog Thursday, GreatFire.org said it has experienced a massive so-called denial of service attack. The method is one that hackers frequently use to foil websites by flooding them with multiple requests — so many that they go offline and viewers see a blank page. GreatFire.org creates encrypted versions of 12 websites that are blocked in China. These are known as mirrored websites and grant users within China access to the content. On Thursday, GreatFire.org said it was receiving 2.6 billion requests an hour for its mirrored websites. On Friday, access to the mirrored websites was inconsistent in China. GreatFire.org’s name is inspired by the Great Firewall, the term often used to describe China’s Internet censorship. About two million people in China access GreatFire’s websites each month, a co-founder of the group who uses the pseudonym Charlie Smith, wrote in an email exchange. It was unclear who was responsible for the attack, which began Tuesday  from inside and outside China, Mr. Smith wrote. GreatFire.org noted in its blog post that its tactics were the recent subject of a report in The Wall Street Journal, which appeared online Monday. The timing for the attack was a mystery. “Maybe that WSJ story,” Mr. Smith wrote. “Maybe because there have been some excellent Chinese-language news pieces and perhaps somebody who supports the authorities took issue with them. In the past there has rarely been rhyme or reason on the timing of such attacks.” GreatFire.org’s mirroring services provide unrestricted access within China to a range of websites, including itself and the Chinese language version of The New York Times, which has been regularly blocked in China. Some of the others are Deutsche Welle, BBC News, China Digital Times, Google.com, and Boxun, a Chinese-language news website. GreatFire.org says it does not mirror The Wall Street Journal.  GreatFire.org works directly with some, but not all, of the websites it mirrors. GreatFire.org is partly funded by Open Technology Fund, a United States government-financed initiative under Radio Free Asia. Last year it provided $114,000 in funding, according to its website. Mr. Smith declined to comment on any financial backing. The Chinese government has in the last year ramped up efforts to prevent its citizens from accessing critical news coverage from abroad and from communicating on social media platforms that the government cannot directly censor. China has long disrupted many of Google’s services. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube remain blocked. LinkedIn agreed to censor its content to operate in the Chinese market last year. GreatFire’s mirroring websites circumvent the Great Firewall by channeling Internet traffic through cloud services, such as one available from Amazon.  The difficulty for the Chinese government is that it can’t just shut off Amazon’s service, because it is used broadly by many major Chinese corporations. Emails to the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese embassy in Washington went unanswered as of Friday evening. Web-hosting giant GoDaddy files for $481M IPO, seeking $2.87B valuation: US-based GoDaddy.Inc, an internet domain registrar and web hosting solutions provider, has fixed the price band for its initial public offer (IPO) which may raise $480.7 million, including the portion allocated to the underwriters. It proposes to list on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), as per a disclosure this week. The firm is offering shares at $17-19 a unit which would value the company as much as $2.87 billion. GoDaddy first attempted to go public in 2006 but ultimately withdrew. It had refiled for an IPO in June 2014. The IPO proceeds will primarily be used for repaying some of the debt the company. took on as part of a 2011 buyout by private-equity firms Silver Lake, KKR & Co. and TCV Investments. GoDaddy currently manages 57 million domains which accounts for around 21 per cent of the world’s registered domains. Since its buyout, it has acquired other services, including Mad Mimi, which helps small businesses promote themselves by email, and Locu, which makes software that manages business-contact information across sites like Yelp and OpenTable. Services made up 8 per cent of its revenue in 2014. The company’s revenue last year was $1.4 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2013. Its 2014 net loss, which included $85 million in interest costs to service debt, narrowed to $143 million from $200 million a year earlier. As of December 31, 2014, it had approximately 12.7 million customers, and in 2014, it added more than 1.1 million customers. In 2014, the firm generated $1.7 billion in total bookings up from $939 million in 2010, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 16 per cent.Taking on Apple Inc, Google and Intel to Team Up with TAG Heuer on a Luxury Smartwatch: On Thursday, TAG Heuer, the Swiss watch company, announced that it was building a new smartwatch — a wrist computer, in essence — as part of a collaboration with Intel and Google. The companies made a joint announcement at Baselworld, an annual show in Basel, Switzerland, for high-priced watches and jewelry. The watch will be released later this year, but aside from that the announcement was light on specifics. No exact release date. Nothing about what it will do. No price. The forthcoming TAG Heuer watch will be designed and manufactured by the Swiss watchmaker. The technology bits will come from Intel’s chip technology and Google’s Android software.Smartstraps may be the solution to wearables: Pebble seeds $1M to encourage smartstrap startups: Pebble is announcing a $1 million fund to support the development of smartstraps, the add-on accessories that are open to hardware makers and that will add functionality to Pebble Time via add-on sensors, batteries and more. Pebble says it’ll be combing crowdfunding platforms to find out about smartstrap projects, and will back those it deems worthy. The company is also soliciting pitches via Twitter and email for anyone  who might be planning a smartstrap, and isn’t pinning itself down with specifics on the terms of how it will actually allocate cash just yet. It’s also promising promotion to worthwhile projects, to raise awareness among the Pebble community. Pebble points to some ideas that have already sprung from the community regarding prototypes  Seeed Studio: include a modular strap with individual links that contain separate features or sensors, like an NFC link, a heart rate sensor link a GPS link and so on. Spark Electron is hardware design that would offer independent cellular connectivity via a smartstrap featuring its Electron SIM-enabled dev kit, letting you use the wearable independently of a connected smartphone.spark-smartstrap-concept.Tesla to have Autopilot on its cars by summer:  Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, took a big step when he announced that the maker of high-end electric cars would introduce autonomous technology by this summer. The technology would allow drivers to have their cars take control on what he called “major roads” like highways. Mr. Musk said that a software update — not a repair performed by a mechanic — would give Tesla’s Model S sedans the ability to start driving themselves, at least part of the time, in a hands-free mode that the company refers to as autopilot. Also to be added are tools to help drivers monitor the status of charging stations and plot routes to ensure the ability to complete a trip without running out of battery power. The move is intended to help reduce so-called range anxiety, the fear drivers have that their battery will run out, prompting them to constantly calculate distances and worry about being stranded.As Microsoft comes to terms with the slow death of its OS business model...: The days of charging customers for an operating system are slowly coming to an end, piece by piece. Microsoft dismantled another piece of its old way of doing business on Wednesday. As part of a broader announcement of partnerships in China, the company said it would allow existing users of Windows personal computers in the country to upgrade free to Windows 10, its coming operating system. The offer is good not only for people who have paid for legitimate copies of Windows on their machines, but those that have pirated copies of the software. The near term effect on Microsoft’s sales is likely to be minimal. The overwhelming majority of Windows software in China is pirated. Only 1 out of every 10 copies of Microsoft’s software in the the country is legitimately purchased, the company’s former chief executive, Steve Ballmer, once said. Microsoft has little Windows licensing revenue in China to jeopardize by giving away free upgrades. But the move echoes a shift at Microsoft and the software industry’s around the world.  This happened first in mobile, a market in which Microsoft has pitifully small market share and, in a variation of its situation in China, not a lot of revenue to lose. Last year it eliminated its licensing fee on Windows for manufacturers creating devices with screens smaller than 9 inches. Then in January, Microsoft said it would let people running the latest versions of Windows on their computers upgrade free to Windows 10. The company’s executives have downplayed the impact that these changes will have on its business model, and for the time being they are right. Most of Microsoft’s Windows revenue comes from sale of the software to PC manufacturers who put the software on their new machines, not to consumers who pay for Windows upgrades to existing machines. Corporate customers will stay need to pay Microsoft for long term agreements that keep their software up to date. How long can these remaining honeypots of Windows revenue last? Windows PCs are under growing pressure at the low end of the consumer PC market from Chromebooks, cheap laptops running a Google operating system, and tablets. To combat their growth, Microsoft last year was forced to cut its Windows licensing fees for laptops that sell for less than $250, which hurt its financial results. For its most recent fiscal year, which ended last June 30, Microsoft’s revenue from Windows for PCs was $16.9 billion, down from $17.6 billion the prior year. Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC, the technology research firm, predicts that corporate customers will continue to pay Microsoft for long-term software agreements that include Windows. Still, he said, “there’s a slippery slope aspect” to the pricing changes happening to Windows in the consumer market. “Sooner or later, enterprises will say, ‘We don’t want to pay for it,'” he said. To make up for lost Windows licensing fees, Mr. Hilwa believes Microsoft will increasingly rely on revenue sources. In a nod to Apple, it will emphasize hardware devices that come coupled with software, like its Surface tablets. And in a nod to Google, it will seek to make money from advertising and other services on its devices....A big name tech investor makes big bets on startup-to-startup APIs: The best way to do business isn’t to build it all in-house. Top companies are increasingly piecing together a composite of APIs from specialized startups. That lets them concentrate on their unique value-add rather than reinventing the wheel. Now those building blocks are turning into big businesses of their own with unique challenges. How do they get traction for their APIs? What does it take to support a developer ecosystem? How much should they charge? Accel Partners thinks it can help. It’s learned from investments in Braintree, Segment.io, Slack, and Checkr. But Accel also knows it missed the boat on Twilio and Heroku. So to attract more API businesses and share its insights, Accel is announcing a new investment focus in what it calls “APX,” the API-ification of business. Developers are constantly posed with the question of whether to buy or build. You either pay for a specialized API or you spend the resources trying to replicate them. But as the cogs get more complex, and the talent wars rage on, in-house development keeps looking slower and more expensive. “You don’t need to go out and source the talent to build these functions,” Natarjan tells me. “You can outsource entire swatches of your company to very reliable APIs. It’s a bit of a talent arbitrage game.” Wong followed up, asking “Why would you go start your own payments capabilities, your own payment analytics, your own map capabilities when they’re so easily accessible from these other companies and are arguably better?” Take background checks, for example. On-demand and sharing economy startups like Instacart or Homejoy need to know the contractors they send to customers’ houses aren’t going to rob them. Normally, these companies would have to hire a team to compare potential hires’ identities against watch lists and criminal records. But their businesses are about grocery delivery and home cleaning, not background checks, so building a team or system to handle them would be a distraction. “With Checkr, that whole function has been reduced to an API,” Natarjan says. Instead of recreating something done better elsewhere, “You can dedicate 100% of your efforts to the 1% that is going to differentiate a product.” “APX is the current picks and shovels,” Accel Partner Rich Wong tells me, alluding to the success of merchants who sold mining tools during the gold rush.India Startup Action: Capillary Technologies in talks with Temasek to raise $80M: Capillary Technologies Pvt Ltd, a SaaS-based CRM solutions provider, is in talks to raise $80 million (Rs 501 crore) from Singapore’s state-owned investment firm Temasek, and a few other investors, sources privy to the development told Techcircle.in. Capillary was set up in August 2008 by IIT Kharagpur alumni Reddy, Krishna Mehra and Ajay Modani. It is into cloud-based software solutions that help retailers engage with customers through mobile, social and in-store channels. The firm claims that its integrated marketing platform helps retailers easily manage their customer data, gain insights and personalise engagement across multiple channels. The company caters primarily to the clients in the retail market, and as of July last year, 40 per cent of its revenues came from apparel, fashion and shoes; 30 per cent from food retail; 20 per cent from white goods and electronics and remaining 10 per cent from pharmacies and hypermarkets. During the same time, it claimed its platform was powering more than 150 brands across 10,000 retail locations. Its clients include Pizza Hut, Benetton, KFC, Puma, Marks & Spencer and Lacoste. In July 2014, Capillary had raised $14 million in its Series B round of funding led by existing investors Sequoia Capital and Norwest Venture Partners (NVP). This round came barely five months after the firm netted $4.5 million in funding from American Express Ventures. This was preceded by a $17 million in its Series A round of funding from Sequoia, NVP and Qualcomm Ventures in 2012.Uber’s Car-Hailing Service Banned in Germany, Court Says. A German court ordered Uber Technologies Inc. to stop its ride-hailing service in the country for profit, dealing a blow to the startup’s expansion plans outside the U.S. It is anti-competitive that Uber routes requests for rides via its UberPop application to drivers “that have no legitimation according to the Passenger Transportation Act, and hence the company is instigating to break the law,” the Frankfurt regional court said in a statement Wednesday. The verdict will affect Uber’s services in Frankfurt and Munich. In Dusseldorf, Berlin and Hamburg, the company has already changed its business model, cutting the fare it charges to as little as 35 euro cents (37 U.S. cents) per kilometer -- effectively turning UberPop into one of Germany’s many non-profit share-a-ride services -- to evade an earlier ban issued by local authorities. “This is a setback, in particular, for all those who want more of a choice when it comes to their personal mobility,” San Francisco-based Uber said in a statement. “It is also a setback for society as a whole, because for the time being most individual transport services will remain expensive and thus not be affordable for everyone.” Uber said it would probably file an appeal. Today’s ruling doesn’t affect its UberBlack limousine service and uberTAXI offers. “We will not give up on the German market,” it said.Yahoo Is Said to Cut 300 Jobs as Part of China Office Close: Yahoo is reportedly laying off 200 to 300 employees in China, shutting down its Beijing research center and pulling out what few operations it has left in the country, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Beijing office was Yahoo’s only physical presence in the country, consisting mainly of engineers working on research and development. They make up about 2 percent of Yahoo’s global staff. A string of layoffs since October have led to as many as 900 people searching for new employment, mostly countries outside the US like Bangalore, India, and Canada. A photo circulating on Chinese social media reportedly shows a slide show presentation at Yahoo’s office in Beijing, explaining to the employees the forthcoming agenda as they prepare to leave their jobs. It seems some employees would have the option of relocating to the US, while others receive a severance package equal to four months base salary plus the number of years employed multiplied by their average monthly income. Within hours of the announcement recruiters and HR departments at other tech companies were, as one source told Tech in Asia, \"feeding on the leftover talent.\" The following screenshot is of a WeChat group of 340 headhunters and HR managers from a wide array of both large and small internet companies. The name of the group, in English, is \"Yahoo recruitment group.\" WSJ reports the layoffs were driven by financial motives, and not related to censorship or government pressure. Yahoo’s China web domain now redirects to its Singapore site.Uxin, Platform for China's Used-Car Market, Raises $170 Million: An online auction house for used cars in China has attracted $170 million from big name investors including the search engine company Baidu, the private equity group K.K.R. and Coatue Management, a New York investment firm. Uxin, which operates used-car auction websites in China that focus on dealers and businesses, said Wednesday that it would use the funds to expand a new website and mobile app aiming at individual consumers. The company also provides inspections, quality guarantees and financing for the vehicles sold on its platforms. “Uxin hopes to use the strengths of its Internet technologies and experience in the used-car market to improve the efficiency of transactions, and to help dealers identify potential buyers with greater accuracy,” Chris Dai, the chief executive of the Chinese company, said in a statement. China is the world’s biggest market for new car sales, but the market for used cars is still comparatively small. Many Chinese are first-time car buyers and see owning a new vehicle as a status symbol. The country’s used-car market has traditionally been highly fragmented and lacking information on the service and repair history of the vehicles being sold. But things appear to be changing rapidly. Transactions in China’s used-car market rose 26 percent in 2014 from a year earlier, to 368 billion renminbi, or about $60 billion. The number of used cars changing hands rose 16 percent to about six million vehicles in the same period, according to figures from the China Automobile Dealers Association cited by Uxin. Online sales and auctions of used cars accounted for a small segment of the market, but they have the advantage of connecting buyers and sellers in different cities or provinces. Uxin said it handled more than 150,000 online and offline car auction transactions a year. The terms of the shareholdings were not disclosed, but for Baidu, China’s biggest online search engine company, investing in Uxin gives it a new market where it can leverage its vast stores of data and large user base. For K.K.R., the deal is the latest by its China Growth Fund, which last summer invested about $400 million in a chicken breeder in Fujian Province in southeastern China.Apple, banks at odds over who is to blame for high fraud rates on Apple Pay: A raft of headlines over the last week about unusually high fraud rates from thieves using stolen credit numbers on Apple Pay has exposed what many of the banks privately acknowledge they have been trying to fix for months. An industry consultant, Cherian Abraham, put the fraud rate at 6 percent, compared with a traditional credit card fraud rate that is relatively minuscule, 10 cents for every $100 spent. Mr. Abraham wrote in a blog post, one of the first to spotlight the issue, that the Apple Pay fraud “is growing like a weed, and the bank is unable to tell friend from foe. No one is bold enough to call the emperor naked.” It is not clear, however, that Apple is the naked emperor. More likely it is at least as much the banks’ fault, if not more. Apple Pay itself should, in theory, cut down on fraud because it makes stealing credit card information almost impossible. Each time a transaction takes place, Apple generates the equivalent of a new credit card number so the merchant never actually sees a customer’s information. The vulnerability in Apple Pay is in the way that it — and card issuers — “onboard” new credit cards into the system. Because Apple wanted its system to have the simplicity for which it has become famous and wanted to make the sign-up process “frictionless,” the company required little beyond basic credit card information about a user. Nor did it provide much information to the banks, like full phone numbers and addresses, that might help them detect fraud early. The banks, desperate to become their customers’ default card on Apple Pay — most add only one to their iPhones — did little to build their own defenses or to push Apple to provide more detailed information about its customers. Some bank executives acknowledged that they were were so scared of Apple that they didn’t speak up. The banks didn’t press the company for fear that they would not be included among the initial issuers on Apple Pay. Within weeks of Apple Pay’s introduction, a second set of banks joined: Barclays, Navy Federal Credit Union, PNC Bank, USAA and U.S. Bank. It also appears that banks set up a flawed process to deal with the credit cards that it did flag. Affected users were directed to a customer care phone center, not a fraud prevention center. A customer care center’s mission is to help customers use their cards, leading more fraudulent cards to be approved for use on Apple Pay. Call centers are a poor approach for two reasons,” Mr. Abraham wrote. “One — fraudsters are better at social engineering than call center reps are at sniffing out fraud. In some cases, fraudsters are calling the call center themselves to ‘alert the bank about a trip out of town’ so that fraud rules looking for transaction anomalies (like a customer living in California and transacting in Miami) do not trip them up.” Some Apple supporters have sought to discredit Mr. Abraham based on his affiliation as an adviser to a company that is based on Apple’s main competitor, Android. While he may indeed be conflicted, he has rightfully raised an important security issue that all sides have acknowledged is a problem, though perhaps not to the extent he has contended. All of this has led to a thriving black market in which thieves enter stolen credit card numbers into iPhones, essentially turning the devices into physical credit cards, which they in turn take to stores and walk out with merchandise. Thieves have even used Apple Pay at Apple Stores. In a statement, Apple put the problem squarely on the shoulders of the banks: “During setup, Apple Pay requires banks to verify each and every card and the bank then determines and approves whether a card can be added to Apple Pay. Banks are always reviewing and improving their approval process, which varies by bank.” Apple has now begun providing additional information to the banks that should help deter some of the fraud. The banks, which are responsible for the costs of the frauds, have toughened standards to review customer sign-ups on Apple Pay. No bank executive would speak with me on the record for fear of upsetting their company’s relationship with Apple. If you’re asking yourself, “Why are criminals more inclined to use Apple Pay than just use stolen credit cards at an online retailer?” it’s a good question. It is apparently much easier for banks to catch thieves using stolen credit cards with online retailers because of the delay in shipping a product — it can often take days — as well as the extra information that every online retailer requires, like an address where the product is to be shipped.Rumor negates rumor: Alibaba may not invest in Snapdeal: Alibaba may scrap plans to invest in Indian online marketplace Snapdeal, technology website Recode reported, citing a person who was familiar with the matter. Last week, a person informed about the deal had told Reuters that Alibaba was in talks with Snapdeal over a potential cash investment in what could have been the Chinese e-commerce giant's first direct investment in India. Alibaba has held discussions with Snapdeal about a possible investment, but the Chinese company is leaning away from investing in Snapdeal right now, Recode said. Snapdeal competes in India with bigger rivals Flipkart.com and Amazon.com, and media reports had said it was seeking $1 billion in its latest funding round to fuel growth. Alibaba and Snapdeal's talks, however, did not involve a deal close to the $1 billion number reported, Recode cited the source as saying.Pinterest valued at $11B on new round of fund-raising: Less than a year after being valued at $5 billion, Pinterest has joined the 11-digit valuation start-up club. Pinterest, an online scrapbooking service, disclosed on Monday that it raised about $367 million in a new round of financing from new and existing investors. It valued the company at $11 billion, putting the start-up in roughly the same range as the Silicon Valley darling Dropbox and the data analysis company Palantir Technologies. In a regulatory filing, Pinterest disclosed that it could raise as much as $211 million in additional financing, bringing its potential haul to $578 million. That would be on top of the $764 million that the nearly five-year-old start-up has raised in previous rounds. Interest has been so ardent that the start-up has nearly tripled its valuation in just about a year and a half. Pinterest has shown strides in expanding and developing revenue, especially with so-called promoted pins that advertisers can buy. Advertising will continue to be a main focus this year, company executives have said.Alibaba founder demos facial recognition payments: Alibaba is working on a new technology called “Smile To Pay” that will allow users to make mobile payments by simply scanning their face. It would basically work the same way as Apple Pay does with fingerprints, where users can approve mobile payments with a single tap on the home button — only, Alibaba wants to replace fingerprints with the user’s face. At Cebit in Hanover, Alibaba founder Jack Ma, after noting how online payments can sometimes be troublesome, the founder took out his smartphone and paid for a set of stamps on Alibaba using face-recognition technology. Alibaba has been open about its plans to release face recognition-enabled payments for Alipay, its third-party payment service, at least since October of last year.TripAdvisor reviews affect tourism of entire countries, hotel revenues: TripAdvisor is the biggest travel reviews website in the world. Today, TripAdvisor lists over 890,000 hotels, holds one of the largest collections of travel photos on the internet, and features accommodation in more than 45 countries. It makes nearly $1 billion in revenue a year and boasts more than 60 million members. Customers of hotels, restaurants, and other attractions add 115 comments to the site every minute, writes Tom Vanderbilt on Outside Online. The site is now so big that its reviews can shift the tourist economies of entire countries, Vanderbilt says. Social media and TripAdvisor have together forced hotel owners to do more than rely on nice photos and clever branding to entice customers, Vanderbilt writes. And that is changing the hotel economies of entire countries. Ireland:  The standout discovery is that as Irish hotel managers took action to garner good reviews on TripAdvisor, their hotels actually got better. And as they did, responses also improved — and visitors arrived more frequently. UK: User-generated content was “directly related to £1.7 billion of tourism spending in the UK,” Big Hospitality reports. In 2012, that figure made up around 2.2% of all tourist spending.  Studies found that reviews even Affect hotels’ “RevPAR,” or revenue per available room. Every positive percentage point a place rises up the tables in TripAdvisor, RevPAR at locations increases by 1.4%. Vanderbilt explains that as a result, hotels can raise prices by 11% to reflect their reputation on the site.Lyft plans to be profitable by 2016, targests $2.7 B topline and reduced driver acquisition spends : Last week on-demand transportation service Lyft announced that it had raised $530 million in new funding as it seeks to steal market share away from arch-rival Uber and launch services in new markets in the U.S. and internationally. While it is clearly second to Uber in both markets it serves and financing it’s raised, Lyft’s financial projections at least show a path to profitability in the next 24 months. This year Lyft is targeting nearly $1.2 billion in gross revenues, of which its take will be around $300 million net. That assumes between 20 and 25 percent commission for the rides it books. In 2016, Lyft expects its revenues to more than double(targeting $2.7 billion). That revenue growth is driven by an increase in the number of rides and passengers that Lyft serves. The company is targeting nearly 90 million rides in total for 2015, which it expects to more than double to 205 million in the year following. While Lyft is generating a lot of cash, it also has a number of costs associated with running the business, including credit card processing fees, insurance, and taxes. After those costs, Lyft forecasts a $170 million gross profit in 2015, which it expects to grow to about $400 million in 2016. That said, its gross profit number doesn’t take into account Lyft’s customer and driver acquisition costs, which the company is using to prime the pump and grow both supply and demand. In 2015, Lyft expects to spend $150 million to acquire new users, while spending an additional $50 million on getting drivers on board to shuttle them around. Taking those numbers into account, there’s a delta of around $30 million between its gross profit and acquisition costs this year. In 2016, the financial picture gets a little better: While gross profit is expected to grow to around $400 million, its spend on driver and passenger acquisition is forecast to increase only slightly, to around $250 million.Snapdeal in talks to buy Jabong’s spun out logistics unit GoJavas for $32M:  Online marketplace major Snapdeal is in talks to acquire logistics firm GoJavas in a deal estimated to be about Rs 150-200 crore, as it looks to further strengthen its delivery operations in the country. GoJavas, which works with eCommerce firms like HealthKart, Jabong, Yepme and Lenskart, covers over 2,500 pincodes in the country. Currently, Snapdeal does not have a captive delivery arm and relies on third-party logistics.Another CFO retires (after Google, Apple, Amazon) : Uber CFO steps down: Brent Callinicos, the chief financial officer of Uber, plans to leave the ride-sharing company, in what will be one of the highest-level departures yet for the six-year-old start-up. Mr. Callinicos’s departure comes just two years after he joined Uber, according to an internal memo to employees obtained by The New York Times, where he helped the company expand from a young start-up to span more than 53 countries. The move comes on the heels of a spree of fund-raising activity for Uber. It also comes amid a spate of chief financial officer retirements at some of the largest companies in Silicon Valley over the past year. But perhaps most important, Mr. Callinicos’s departure comes shortly after Uber arranged a private sale of convertible debt, managed by Goldman Sachs. The terms of this offering, as described by people briefed on the matter, give Uber an incentive to go public within the next few years. The securities being offered to Goldman’s clients can be converted into stock — at a discount of roughly 20 to 30 percent of Uber’s valuation in an initial stock offering. Non-compete agreements drive away talent, Silicon Valley thrives in their absence:  In Silicon Valley,  Not only are formal alliances commonplace among the local firms, it is also, arguably, one of the most dynamic labour markets in the world. Here, the culture is one of loyalty to the profession rather than to a firm. Equally, there is nowhere else on the globe that can compete with the number of start-ups which successfully launch and, more importantly, stay in business and go on to be global leaders in the industry.  But what drives this collaborative environment? Silicon Valley’s vibrancy can’t all be pinned down to one factor. However, one critical characteristic of Californian is that firms simply cannot enforce non-compete agreements on their employees – as the state doesn’t recognise them legally. There  is clear evidence that talented workers feel a pull towards states where they can change employers freely and take their creativity with them.  In today’s collaborative business environment, this raises some questions about whether non-competes really are the best tool for protecting intellectual property and recouping technological investments even from the perspective of the companies involved.  It is important to recognise that these are a double-edged sword.  Preventing employees from going to work for a competitor could not only hurt your competitor, but it could be hurting your own business too if one looks at the bigger picture.  Because finding the right match between an employee and employer is a little like the dating game — some are matches are made in heaven, some are not — and it is beneficial to be able to break the relationship as easily as possible, should the need arise. If, however, your own employees and your competitor’s employees are unable to find the right match for fear of breaking a contract, the only outcome is a zero-sum game.  In this situation, the degree of experimentation between employees and firms becomes that much harder, leading to an inefficient labour market. As well as being detrimental at firm level, the consequences are felt across the industry and region. Rumor of the day: Snapdeal in advanced talks to buy Freecharge for INR 2800 crores: Snapdeal is reportedly in advance talks to buy online recharge company Freecharge for Rs 2,800 crore. Freecharge, which allows users to recharge their pre-paid phones and get an equal value discount coupon, has emerged as a popular recharge option and a head-on competitor of PayTM, which recently attracted investment from Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. Freecharge has raised multiple rounds of funding. In February 2015, it raised $80 million from San Francisco-based hedge fund Valiant Capital Management and Hong Kong-based Tybourne Capital Management along with Sequoia Capital, RuNet and Sofina Capital. In September 2014, the company had mobilised $33 million from Sequoia Capital, Sofina and RuNet. It had also raised Rs 20 crore from Sequoia Capital in 2011. If the deal goes through, this will the largest acquisition in the Indian e-commerce space . It will even trump Flipkart's acquisition of fashion e-tailer Myntra last year for a whopping $370 million. If the acquisition comes through, there are several reasons it will make sense for Snapdeal, the leader in the marketplace business. Snapdeal will ride on Freecharge's growing popularity and its huge user base of over 20 million users. Freecharge works with upwards of 300-odd retailers, selling their discount coupons and processes recharges worth over Rs 100 crore per month. For most mobile recharge companies like Freecharge, PayTM, Mobikwik or Oxigen, mobile recharge is a very thin margin product but has worked well to grab a massive user base. Having scaled up to a few million, these companies have used their customer base as launch pads for a host of other services, including DTH recharges, utility bill payments, online shopping, bus ticket bookings, movie bookings and ordering from fast-food chains such as Dominos and Pizza Hut. For instance, Oxigen Services (India), launched in 2004 as a mobile recharge venture, now does Rs 600 crore worth of transactions per month - the biggest chunk of its business comprising money transfers (Rs 200 crore), followed by recharges (Rs 100 crore) and bill payments (Rs 30 crore) The deal will help Snapdeal diversify into a host of other online services, get more retailers onboard and provide it an edge over its emerging competitor in the marketplace model -- PayTM, now backed by Alibaba's might. Also, since mobile is the most important leg of growth, this acquisition will make the Snapdeal brand resonate better on mobile phones.Not topical, but interesting: A well-known link on Top 12 Product Management Mistakes:  1.

Lyft, another ride-hailing start-up and Uber’s biggest competitor in the United States, announced on Thursday that it had raised $530 million in venture capital, valuing the start-up at $2.5 billion. The investment was led by Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce giant, which contributed more than $300 million.China puts tech bill that concerns West on hold: U.S. official: China has put a hold on a draft counter-terrorism law that would require technology firms to hand over sensitive information to government officials, a senior U.S. official said in a good sign for Western businesses who saw the rule as a major impediment to working in the world's second largest economy. President Barack Obama said in an interview with Reuters on March 2 that he had raised concerns about the law directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping. \"They have decided to suspend the third reading of that particular law, which has sort of put that on hiatus for the moment,\" White House Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael Daniel said on Thursday, according to a webcast of a discussion at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. \"We did see that as something that was bad not just for U.S. business but for the global economy as a whole, and it was something we felt was very important to communicate very clearly to them,\" Daniel said. It was not clear whether the bill would proceed or not. China Central Television reported on March 9 that Wang Aili, a senior official with the Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee's legislative affairs commission, said the bill was not on the schedule for the NPC's annual session, which began last week. A third reading and vote would be scheduled in \"due time,\" he said. The law would require technology firms to hand over encryption keys, the passcodes that help protect data, and install security \"backdoors\" in their systems to give Chinese authorities surveillance access. One industry source, who requested anonymity, said the move gave companies \"some breathing room, but not complete relief\" because the bill could be picked up again at any point as only the standing committee — not the full parliament – was needed to pass a law. But another was optimistic that was the end of the matter. \"The Chinese are not ready to kick out all foreign companies, and because they weren’t ready to take that step, they backed off,\" said a U.S. technology industry expert, who asked not to be identified to avoid complicating his employer's dealings in China. \"You can bet that the next steps will be something that tightens up somewhere but doesn’t cause this level of pain.\" The initial draft, published by the NPC late last year, requires companies to also keep servers and user data within China, supply law enforcement authorities with communications records and censor terrorism-related Internet content.Cash burns fast for Uber-like startups that grow city by city - \"You have an operations team that is on a city-by-city basis, but you make sure your engineering team is not city-by-city\" : The list of city-by-city startups includes mobile car-booking companies Uber Technologies and Lyft, food delivery startup Munchery, parking provider SpotHero, shopping service Instacart and laundry startup Washio. While they rely on technology to deliver new products and services, their business models are a departure from the low-cost ventures built by a few programmers working in a cramped office. Instead, they're setting up kitchens, renting warehouses and hiring local staff. Among the startups that raised a third financing round in 2013 or 2014, 14 are expanding from city to city and have attracted an average of $65 million in funding, more than double the amount raised by the rest, according to PitchBook Data, a financial information provider. Uber is leading the pack, with a presence in almost 300 cities in 55 countries. Valued at $40 billion, the mobile car-hailing startup is on a hiring spree for operations staff, with more than 200 job postings for staff outside of the company's headquarters in San Francisco, from Miami to Moscow. CEO Travis Kalanick's steady ramp-up has required Uber to raise an enormous amount of cash totaling more than $5 billion. In January, Bloomberg News reported the car-booking startup raised $1.6 billion in convertible debt, and that it was still on the lookout to collect more financing. Some investors warn that cash-intensive startups are at risk of flopping, pointing to previous attempts by delivery companies Kozmo.com and Webvan, which also sought to expand city to city in the late 1990s, only to crash when the dot-com bubble burst in the new millennium. Marc Andreessen, Silicon Valley investor and startup veteran, cautioned last year that enterprises rapidly burning cash may be unable to survive in an adverse environment.1 Apoorva Mehta, Instacart's CEO, is betting his delivery startup will be nimble enough to avert a crunch. The San Francisco-based company, which raised $220 million at a $2 billion valuation in January, initially sold groceries to customers with a markup. Now, Instacart is more focused on cutting deals with food stores to deliver produce and other goods for a fee. Instacart needs less cash to expand (compared with Amazon, which also delivers groceries in some urban areas) since it doesn't have to build warehouses or large stores. \"You have an operations team that is on a city-by-city basis, but you make sure your engineering team is not city-by-city,\" Mehta said.Alibaba hiring in Amazon, Microsoft backyard as U.S. cloud unit expands: Alibaba has begun hunting staff in Seattle, home turf of Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp, focusing on savvy cloud computing hires as it ramps up U.S. operations. Several recruiters in the region said they had registered the firm's hiring drive, suggesting Alibaba is eyeing staff at rival Amazon as well as Microsoft and Facebook Inc. According to LinkedIn's data, Alibaba has already hired staff away from Microsoft and Amazon. LinkedIn data list Microsoft as the top company from which former employees have joined Alibaba, not specifying the location of the hires, with 20 recruits for unspecified posts at the Chinese company having previously worked at the software giant. With the job openings Alibaba joins the increasingly fierce fight for cloud computing talent in Silicon Valley and Seattle, where it opened a research and development center in what is Microsoft and Amazon's backyard late last year. The Chinese company's arrival on the tech job market is - for now - unlikely to pose a concern to major industry incumbents, who in past years have resorted to increasingly imaginative tactics to recruit scant human resources. Alibaba's moves in the region are at an early stage, and the amount of hiring still comparatively low, said recruiters. The company has fewer than 300 employees in the United States. But Alibaba is looking at Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook in the Seattle area for new blood, particularly developers, said Jerry Taylor, president of Executive Recruiters Inc in Bellevue, Washington. \"I'm sure they're going to be web-based as well as mobile-type folks,\" he said. \"They're trying to get a footprint in the United States. What better place to go than their direct competitor in Amazon?\" An Alibaba spokesman declined to give details of recruitment. Alibaba's talent hunt coincides with a broader push in the United States this year to win over U.S. business, offering American retailers new ways to sell to China's vast and growing middle class. On March 4 it launched a cloud computing hub in Silicon Valley, its first outside of China. Alibaba has hired at least 10 software engineers or computing experts from either Microsoft or Amazon since July 2014, all but one based in the greater Seattle area, according to their LinkedIn profiles. Li Xiaolong, one of the 10 and a senior staff engineer at Alibaba, openly advertises for like-minded talent on his profile: \"We are actively hiring talents in machine learning, data mining and distributed computing, as well as hardcore software engineers to improve the world's biggest e-commerce platform. The location can be Seattle, Silicon Valley, Beijing or Hangzhou.\"F.C.C. Sets Net Neutrality Rules: The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday released extensive details of how it would regulate broadband Internet providers as a public utility, producing official wording that almost certainly sets the stage for extended legal fights. The release of the rules had been eagerly anticipated by advocates and lawmakers, as well as broadband and technology companies, since the agency approved new rules for Internet service two weeks ago. The details came in a 313-page document that included the new rules and the legal justifications for them. The rules revealed how the strict laws would be modified for Internet providers, exempting the companies from the sort of price controls typically applied to utilities, for example. But the full text of the new order also raised uncertainties about broad and subjective regulation. One catchall provision, requiring “just and reasonable” conduct, allows the F.C.C. to decide what is acceptable on a case-by-case basis. Opponents of the rules, including many of the leading Internet providers, spent Thursday poring over the document. It was not known who would file the first legal challenges, or exactly what legal arguments would be made. Many experts, though, said the document included plenty of opportunity for different interpretations. The “just and reasonable” provision, said Roger Entner, the lead analyst at Recon Analytics in Boston, “can be stretched like chewing gum.” He suggested that it would inspire a flood of proactive, permission-seeking petitions from businesses large and small. He pointed to mobile-messaging companies like Snapchat or WhatsApp that may be transmitting voice or video and seeking money from investors who want legal assurances before signing checks. “Before acting, you need to know: Is this kosher with the F.C.C.?” The debate about how to preserve the open Internet has persisted for more than a decade, and the F.C.C.’s new rules are not its first attempt to protect it. But the issue picked up momentum in the last year, with President Obama taking the unusual action of publicly urging the independent agency to approve strong regulation. The agency’s order reclassifies high-speed Internet as a telecommunications service rather than an information one, subjecting providers to regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Its aim is to protect the open Internet, advancing principles of so-called net neutrality by prohibiting broadband providers from elevating one kind of content over another. “Threats to Internet openness remain today,” the agency wrote in the document released on Thursday. “The record reflects that broadband providers hold all the tools necessary to deceive consumers, degrade content or disfavor the content that they don’t like.” Comcast and Verizon, two leading Internet service providers, declined to comment. Jim Cicconi, AT&T’s senior executive vice president for external and legislative affairs, called the order’s publication the beginning of “a period of uncertainty” that the company was confident would be resolved “by bipartisan action by Congress or a future F.C.C., or by the courts.”Educational toy maker LeapFrog, once unique, is battered by the app disruption: Battered by a growing variety of cheaper alternatives, LeapFrog, a dominant maker of educational toys and games, has watched its sales plummet. It has become the target of short-sellers, investors who bet on a company’s failures, and was most recently sued by shareholders who claimed it had drastically overestimated consumer demand for its products. “As each year passes by and more apps are for free and they’re lower priced, it becomes a tougher sell,” said Jim Silver, the editor in chief of TTPM, a toy review website. Slow to adapt, critics say, LeapFrog has become something of a modern-day fable for how quickly technology has unseated the toy industry’s titans. Mike Wood, a lawyer, created the company upon realizing how few educational products existed for his 3-year-old son, who was having trouble learning to read. He founded the company in 1995, and in 1999 introduced the first LeapPad, an electronic book with audio and pen that helped children learn to read. As technology evolved, LeapFrog seized the opportunity to create a tablet just for children: no web-browsing abilities and a limited set of games. It introduced the original LeapPad tablet in 2011 for $100 at a time when the average tablet in the United States sold for about $470, according to data from Euromonitor. Sales skyrocketed. Sean McGowan, an analyst with Needham and Company, estimates that the company sold 1.2 million tablets the first year, and more than doubled that in 2012, when the LeapPad 2 came out. The hardware, combined with its software and content, most likely made up more than half of the company’s revenue, Mr. McGowan said. “Back then, not every family had an adult tablet they were willing to give to their child,” said Gerrick Johnson, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets. Just a few years later, however, the idea of a tablet that appeals precisely because it can do a limited set of tasks seems almost quaint. Older generations of iPads have become hand-me-downs from parents to children, while tablets get cheaper every year. Parents can program their grown-up devices with educational games, instead of buying a separate specialized system. Sales of various LeapPads to retailers began to plateau in 2013, according to Mr. McGowan, who estimates that they dropped more than 40 percent in 2014. On a weekday afternoon, Flora Bojadziev, a chef from Harlem, browsed through a Toys “R” Us in Manhattan. She was looking for educational toys for her 2 ½-year-old son, who plays with her iPad. But she balked at the idea of spending $130 on LeapFrog’s LeapPad Ultra XDi, an educational tablet for children, on sale in the aisle a few steps away. “With that money, I’ll buy him so many apps,” said Ms. Bojadziev, who is 33. That is precisely the problem for LeapFrog, which built a multimillion-dollar company on children’s devices before babies learned to swipe the screens of iPads.Hot Billion $ News :Alibaba is investing $200 million in Snapchat at $15 billion valuation – after it declined 3B offer from facebook: With the latest deal, Snapchat would be ranked behind only mobile car-booking application Uber Technologies Inc. and Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., according to data compiled by researcher CB Insights. Xiaomi is pegged at $45 billion, while Uber’s latest round valued it at $40 billion. Snapchat lets people take and draw on photos, then send them to select friends or add them to a public “story.” The photos and videos disappear seconds after the recipient views them. The company says its users -- the app is popular among teens -- send more than 700 million disappearing “snaps” and view more than 500 million stories daily. Evan Spiegel started Snapchat in a Stanford University fraternity house in 2011 and turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook Inc. in 2013. He raised funds from 23 investors at a $10 billion valuation last year. That increase has corresponded with a surge in venture spending to the highest level in more than a decade. Venture capitalists pumped $48.3 billion into U.S. companies last year, according to data from the National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers.Google launched a cheap cloud storage service – promises data retrieval in 3 secs: Google is offering a new kind of data storage service called Nearline, for non-essential data. Like an AWS product called Glacier, this storage costs just a penny a month per gigabyte. Microsoft’s cheapest listed online storage is about 2.4 cents a gigabyte. While Glacier storage has a retrieval time of several hours, though, Google said Nearline data will be available in about three seconds. The name is meant to evoke the idea of being nearly online at all times, It is also designed to move easily into other Google storage products, with sub-second data retrieval. That could make it a way to sell more expensive storage, as well as more analytics tools. Google’s long game, in other words, is positioning itself as the cloud computing company for all kinds of data analysis, something that it at the heart of its search engine business.Hot Billion $ Rumor#1 : Google may buy InMobi for $1B: Google Inc is in early talks to buy Bangalore-based start-up InMobi, in a move that would strengthen its offering in the increasingly competitive mobile advertising space, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said.InMobi, which helps companies target phones and mobile devices in their advertising, was launched in 2007 and claims to have over 1 billion users across 200 countries. It counts Japan's SoftBank, an early backer of China's Alibaba, and early stage venture capital firm Sherpalo among investors.Hot Billion $ Rumor#2: Snapdeal might raise $ 700 million from Foxconn(Taiwan): Snapdeal.com, has attracted interest from Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology Group, one of the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturing firms, to raise as much as $600-700 million in a fresh round of funding, at least two sources familiar with the matter told Techcircle.in. However, the talks are still at a preliminary stage and the company is yet to issue a term sheet. “Foxconn is world’s biggest contract electronics manufacturer. But they are now finding new growth drivers as revenue from the contract manufacturing business is slowing down. India being a huge retail market, this is a great opportunity for them,” said one of the persons mentioned above.Online retail had a bumper year ($326.6 billion), key to 2015 success: Payments, CustomerFirst, Data:Overall, the retail industry posted solid growth last year and e-commerce really knocked it out of the park. Total retail sales reached approximately $4.12 trillion in 2014 and online retail made up about 7.9% of that ($326.6 billion). Compared to 2013, 2014 “nonstore retailers” sales, which includes e-commerce, grew by 7.7%. The last quarter of 2014 was strong for e-commerce, as online sales increased by 2.3% between Q3 and Q4. After being adjusted for seasonal variance, the US Department of Commerce estimates that online retailers sold $79.6 billion worth of goods. This made up 6.7% of total retail sales, which reached $1.2 trillion. Tips for this year: Increase Payment Options: About 54% of shoppers like having the option to use payment methods beyond credit and debit. This often boils down to security concerns. Consider offering alternative payment options, such as PayPal, to give customers choices and make them feel safer. Put the Customer First: Approximately 83% of consumers require some sort of customer support while making an online purchase and if you can deliver, you’ll reap the benefits. Roughly 86% of consumers said they’d pay more for a good customer experience, and that is possible through live chat. Be clear on what shoppers are looking for, provide helpful recommendations, and answer questions in real time. Use Data Effectively: There are different kinds of data, and even more ways to use them. Even though it can be overwhelming, it is crucial for e-commerce success. It can allow retailers to provide a more personalized experience and target shoppers better when they abandon their cart. Know what they’ve added to their carts and use those items to remind them to come back. Provide great recommendations based on what they’ve previously ordered to create loyal customers. Data can even give retailers a better idea of what price is best on products based on the competitive landscape, demand, and more.Why does a company with hundreds of billions in cash raise debt? Because it can - Apple has timed the bond market superbly, calling market tops, but at the expense of its bond buyers: Apple Inc., as it turns out, knows the bond market too. The company has an uncanny ability to raise money in debt markets right before interest rates go up. That means buyers are often left with losses. Take the iPhone maker’s $6.5 billion debt sale on Feb. 2. Those notes have already lost more than $230 million of value through Monday. And remember the company’s record-breaking $17 billion bond sale in April 2013, sold just three days before Treasury yields began the biggest two-month surge in a decade? “When they decide to go to market, they’re watching for whenever there’s a potential inflection point forming,” said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “They have a feeling that something’s going to happen.” The reason for the decline in Apple’s bonds isn’t a repudiation of the Apple Watch’s success or the company’s ability to come up with new products. Instead, it underscores the risks investors are taking in a market that’s become about the most sensitive ever to moves in U.S. government debt yields. U.S. Treasuries have declined 2.7 percent since the end of January, with notes maturing in more than 15 years falling 8.8 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The $2 billion of 30-year notes that Apple sold last month have fallen to 92.2 cents on the dollar from 99.1 cents at issuance. More generally, Apple’s dollar-denominated bonds have lost more than 3 percent since the end of January, compared with 1.8 percent of losses on Bank of America’s index of U.S. investment-grade corporates. With plenty of cash on its balance sheet, Apple certainly doesn’t need to borrow extra money to support its business. Instead, it has the luxury of waiting until yields get so low that the top-rated company would practically be financially irresponsible not to borrow money The company doesn’t even have to use the proceeds to invest in new products or pay back existing debt; Apple can simply funnel the cash raised from bond buyers to boost returns for its stock holders, namely by repurchasing shares. Indeed, as bondholders suffered losses since January, the company’s stock soared more than 8 percent. As yields go lower on all corporate debt, investors are taking a bigger gamble that benchmark rates will stay low for a longer period of time. “Rates are so low that ultimately, what are investors going to get out of it at the end of the day?” Lurie said. On $6 billion of new Apple bonds, nothing but losses so far.Google's CFO retires to spend time with family: Patrick Pichette, Google’s chief financial officer, is retiring to spend more time with his family. Seriously. On Tuesday Mr. Pichette announced the news of his retirement on Google’s social network, Google Plus. Then, in what Google’s chief executive, Larry Page, described as “a most unconventional leaving notice” he tried to convince the cynics that he is, indeed, retiring to spend more time with his family. “We give a lot to our jobs,” he wrote, adding: “And while I am not looking for sympathy, I want to share my thought process because so many people struggle to strike the right balance between work and personal life.” For the last seven years, Mr. Pichette, 52, has been the primary liaison between Google and Wall Street, serving as the search giant’s chief defender against analysts who have been needling the company to do things like spend less money on “moonshots” or give shareholders some of their cash back. In the company’s latest conference call, for instance, he repeatedly defended Google’s speculative investment spending – which range from biotech to self-driving cars – as “disciplined.” He said the company did not have any immediate plans to issue a dividend to shareholders, but also didn’t rule it out. And, for analysts who needed the reassurance, he noted that Google’s stock price “does matter” to its managers. Mr. Pichette’s goodbye letter was touching, adventurous and completely outside the experience of 99 percent of the world’s population. On Google Plus, he wrote that the process that led to his decision to retire began in September. He was watching the sunrise from the top of Mount Kilimanjaro when his wife suggested they continue traveling the world. He replied that it wasn’t time yet – he had too much to accomplish at Google and elsewhere, he wrote. She asked when it would be time. Apparently that time is in a few months, during which Google will search for Mr. Pichette’s replacement, according to a spokesman. “The questions just hung there in the cold morning African air,” Mr. Pichette wrote of his thoughts about retirement from atop Kilimanjaro. There ensued a long mediation on life, children and work (Mr. Pichette said he belonged to the “Fraternity of Worldwide Insecure Overachievers”). “Allow me to spare you the rest of the truths,” he wrote. “But the short answer is simply that I could not find a good argument to tell Tamar we should wait any longer for us to grab our backpacks and hit the road — celebrate our last 25 years together by turning the page and enjoy a perfectly fine midlife crisis full of bliss and beauty, and leave the door open to serendipity for our next leadership opportunities, once our long list of travels and adventures is exhausted.”Alibaba investee Weibo 2014 revenue: $334M, +77%; loss widens to $63.4M; 176 MAU in Dec, +36% Y/Y Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social network, continues to grow – albeit slowly. Weibo ended 2014 with 175.7 million monthly active users (MAUs), which is up 36 percent year-on-year, and up 5.2 percent from Q3 to Q4. Although many have talked about WeChat making Weibo irrelevant, it seems that Weibo is standing its ground against the hugely popular messaging app (WeChat is close to 500 million MAUs) despite a number of areas of overlap between the two social networks. Weibo’s newest data, released overnight as part of the company’s Q4 2014 earnings report, also shows that daily active users (DAUs) are moving upwards slowly. Weibo now has 80.6 million DAUs. As always with Weibo, there are concerns about how many of those users are humans or spambots. So is Weibo, which started in 2009 and received US$586 million in investment from Alibaba in 2013, making any money after five years of operations? Nope. Throughout the whole of 2014, Weibo made $334.2 million in revenue (up 77 percent from 2013’s tally), but that translated into a net loss of US$63.4 million, which is greater than its losses in 2013.Apple unveils the Apple Watch and makes a play for the truly affluent with a watch — priced as high as $17,000: Pricing: the device would start at $350 and, depending on the band and finish you chose, go into the thousands of dollars. Battery Life: While rumors had suggested that Apple was having trouble getting the battery lifespan up to something reasonable, Apple now claims that its watch should be able to handle at least 18 hours of regular use. That’ll vary depending on how you use it, of course — but Apple is content enough with the lifespan to call it an “All-day battery”.Hardware: the Apple Watch comes close to being beautiful, and it is certainly one of the best-looking computers you can buy for your wrist. Yet it’s hard to forget that it is a computer for your wrist. Even in its top-end versions, it lacks the understated elegance of old-fashioned high-end analog watches. Interface: Last fall, Apple made a big show of the rotating crown on the side of the device, the company’s take on what most of us call a watch dial. The company held up the crown as its next great interface, something on the order of the mouse, the iPod’s clickwheel or the touch screen on the iPhone. I was surprised, therefore, to discover how small a role the crown plays in typical use of the watch. It has two primary uses: When you press it, you get to the watch’s main screen of apps — or, if you’re already on that screen, the watch switches to displaying the clock. In other words, the crown works as a home button. Uses: Apple spent a long while going through most of the watch’s major functions, including its use as a fitness tracker, texting app, email reader and payment device for locations that accept Apple Pay. I boiled down the list to this rule of thumb: Just about anything you can do with your phone, you can do with your watch, faster. But because the watch needs the phone for connectivity, it’s hardly liberating you from that device. It’s just giving you less of a reason to look at it. Collections: The Apple Watch is unique among Apple’s product offerings in terms of just how much variety it offers in terms of buyer options. To help clarify and define the available choices, the company has separated Apple Watch models into three distinct collections: The Apple Watch Sport, the Apple Watch, and the Apple Watch Edition. All three offer both 38mm and 42mm rectangular case sizing options, but materials and finishes vary by collection, as do the band options offered by default. As Alibaba stock continues to slide, firm announces a re-org, brings Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan into a newly created division: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd appointed Jeff Zhang to oversee its main services on Monday, bringing Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan into a newly created \"China Retail Marketplaces\" division. The appointment marks one of the highest-profile personnel shuffles since China's largest e-commerce company went public in September. Together with the creation of the new division, the move will streamline operations and enhance efficiency. The company, which now handles more ecommerce than Amazon.com and eBay Inc combined, has been struggling to sustain the rip-roaring pace of growth it enjoyed in past years as it gains scale. It's unclear how Zhang's appointment affected Yilei Wang, who was President of the Amazon.com-like Tmall retail website. On Monday, Chinese news website sina.com reported that Wang had been dismissed from his post, though the company declined to comment on his current situation. Shares in the company ended 2.2 percent lower at $82.53 on the New York stock exchange. India is becoming the land of the errand app: A growing number of startups cater to people who want to avoid the poor roads and polluted air, and can afford to do so because of the plentiful cheap labor. Almost anyone can use an app to have someone pick up groceries, drop off a letter at the post office or prepare a lunch that runs 75 rupees ($1.20) with delivery. “People today want to do as much as possible with their phones,” said TinyOwl co-founder Mandad, who graduated from Mumbai’s Indian Institute of Technology in 2012. “It is a friction just to go out -- there’s the heavy traffic, pollution and waiting involved for a cab.” The startups are carving out niches by serving certain neighborhoods or parts of cities, realizing the “hyper-local” strategy long envisioned in more developed countries including the U.S. Larger e-commerce companies such as Flipkart and Snapdeal dominate online sales of more traditional goods, including books, apparel and electronic goods. Need your bike serviced, your dry-cleaning picked up or even your own errand boy for a few hours? There are services for all that. There are also at least a dozen startups focused on food and grocery delivery, with angel investors and venture capital firms lining up to invest. With traffic snarls in big Indian cities an everyday occurrence, it’s common to find vehicles crawling along at less than 5 kilometers per hour on some Delhi roads, almost as slow as bullock carts, government data shows. Air quality is poor, with several cities faring worse than even Beijing. All that has translated to fewer visitors in stores. People can get everything from apparel to groceries at the click of a button, said consultant Ashok Deenadayalu, who advises retailers on strategy and store management. “Earlier it used to be a pastime to go to the malls on a weekend,” Deenadayalu, who’s had a 24-year career at some of the nation’s largest chains such as Reliance Retail, Bharti Wal Mart Pvt. and Metro AG. “Now it’s just a torture.”China's market regulator claims it will tighten eCommerce regulations: China’s market regulator said today that the government will regulate ecommerce more strictly in an upcoming clampdown on counterfeit products and poor customer service. The comments came from Zhang Mao, minister of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), speaking on the sidelines of China’s annual parliamentary session, according to state news agency Xinhua. The move comes weeks after the SAIC produced a controversial report on fake products being sold online by China’s top ecommerce stores. That report slammed Alibaba’s marketplace, Taobao, claiming that about 63 percent of the stuff for sale on the site is counterfeit. However, that was extrapolated from a survey of 51 products that SAIC’s secret shoppers bought from Taobao. SAIC’s entire report was based on just 92 products bought from six leading Chinese estores. “The reason why there are so many market violations is that the cost of breaking rules is too low,” Zhang said Monday in reference to Taobao’s poor performance in the SAIC’s study. He added that new regulations on ecommerce would be focused on companies’ “key responsibilities” to consumers in terms of “credibility and integrity.” Referring to China’s online retailers, Zhang said the SAIC will “listen to them, provide guidance for them, and demand their self-discipline.”Adding to India investments, News Corp buys VCCircle: News Corp is continuing its focus on India after it announced a deal to buy tech and startup-focused media company VCCircle. Founded in 2005, VCCircle runs news sites VCCircle.com and Techcircle.in, in addition to research platform VCCEdge, VCCircle Training and an events business. The Noida-headquartered company has over 100 staff, and it will become part of the News Corp India organization, which already includes Dow Jones and Wall Street Journal. The undisclosed deal is Media Corp’s third piece of business in India, each of which has closed in the past six months. The U.S. media giant put $30 million into property company PropTiger back in November, and it bought financial planning service Bigdecisions.com in December. “This significant investment is a sign of our faith in India’s future and our enthusiasm for working with and building up emerging talents in the country. India is an increasingly meaningful part of our portfolio, which is itself increasingly digital and global,” News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson said in a canned statement. P.V. Sahad, Founder and CEO of VCCircle, said that the company’s acquisition would “accelerate our already aggressive growth plans,” although he did not provide more specific details of those goals. India’s booming tech scene is attracting investors in large numbers — including SoftBank, Google Capital and a new Tiger Global fund — and higher funding rounds, all of which increases the importance of quality on-the-ground reporting, analysis and events. Added to that, this is an interesting deal because we don’t often see ‘pure-play’ media companies being acquired in India.Jet, an American marketplace is gaining traction by focusing on the merchant experience rather than the customer experience: The Jet business model is pretty simple.  Jet plans on making their revenue from a $50/yr subscription paid for by members.  Like a warehouse club model (Costco, BJ’s, Sams) that will be the primary driver.  Also like a wholesale club model, Jet plans on passing a lot of savings to the member. The merchant model is similar to what you would find at an eBay or Amazon marketplace – you pay a commission for sales based on category.  BUT there are two important differences: A merchant can choose a variable commission based on your own rules (see example below) for shipping, email opt-in, returns and more. Jet takes the commission and instead of pocketing it as profit as other marketplaces do, it returns it to the consumer in the form of Jet savings and behavior based incentives (more on this later).As programming becomes ubiquitous, Yale's weak Computer Science program is driving top students to Stanford, Harvard instead: One of the world's top universities in most respects, Yale has fallen way behind in computer science. Yale, one of the world's top universities in most respects, has fallen behind in computer science. It doesn't crack the highest tier of schools measured by the number of graduates in software companies or by salaries for majors in the discipline; it's struggling to educate throngs of students with a faculty about the same size as three decades ago; top students in the field are opting to enroll elsewhere; the head of its computer science department is publicly complaining; and undergraduates are circulating a petition in protest. “The best universities in the world are now judged by the quality of their computer science departments,” reads the petition, distributed this week and signed by more than 450 students. “We are distraught by the condition of Yale's.” Yale has long been known for its strength in the humanities. Literature scholars deconstructed texts in cloistered seminar rooms at the center of its Gothic campus, while the more quantitative-minded had to trek up “Science Hill” for their classes. Famed English literature professor Harold Bloom once told the Paris Review that he favored the ballpoint pen over the typewriter and “as far as I'm concerned, computers have as much to do with literature as space travel, perhaps much less.” Yale's computer science department has focused more on theory than practical applications, unlike Stanford University, known as the birthplace of Google, or Harvard, associated with Facebook and Microsoft. Though many of Yale's science Ph.D. programs such as biology, math, physics, and chemistry are top-ranked, Yale is struggling to adapt to a U.S. economy and educational system reordered by the ascendance of technology. With fewer students majoring in the humanities and a generation of graduates worried about getting good jobs, universities are scrambling to shift resources from traditional subjects into fields once scoffed at as vocational. “These are skills needed by anyone in the modern age,” says Jeannette Wing, who oversees research labs worldwide for Microsoft. All students should learn programming, even those studying such fields as archeology and English, she says.Apple's Secret Lab Lets Facebook Fine-Tune Apps Before the Watch's Debut: In a lab shut off from communication with the outside world and where visitors can't bring in a pad of paper, let alone a phone, Apple Inc. has given some companies special early access to Apple Watch. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, Facebook Inc., United Continental Holdings Inc. and others have spent weeks at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, working hands-on with the smartwatch to test and fine-tune applications that will debut alongside the device next month, according to people familiar with the process, who asked not to be identified because of non-disclosure agreements. Apple, which will share more details about the gadget at a March 9 event, uses extreme measures to keep the work secret. Internet access is blocked inside the rooms, and no outside materials can be brought in to the labs with the test watches, a person who attended said. The companies, sometimes sharing a room, must bring in source code for their apps on a computer hard drive that can't leave Apple's headquarters. To prevent information from leaking out, Apple is storing the code and sending it to the companies closer to the watch's introduction date, the person said. \"There's a lot of confidentiality,\" said Stephen Gates, a vice president and creative director for Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., which is building a watch application to unlock hotel-room doors. Apple featured Starwood's application in September, when it first announced the watch. Gates said he's made several trips to Cupertino to develop the software, but declined to comment on what those visits included. As Apple's first new device since the iPad in 2010, the stakes are high for Apple Watch, and the sophistication of the apps available is critical in wooing buyers. Just as the App Store has been a key reason for the iPhone's success, tools for Apple Watch will help determine how customers use the gadget and whether it will be a sales hit. The watch must be paired with an iPhone to fully work, and anything less than seamless integration may alienate potential customers. Apple has made the yet-to-be-released watch available to some companies so they can test out their apps, check for glitches and adjust the tools to the watch's design. Hundreds of applications may immediately be available once the Watch reaches stores, according to Jim Suva, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. A big challenge for Apple and its developers is building applications that are useful without being annoying. Apple has recommended that developers be judicious about interrupting people with constant alerts that will buzz their wrist or drain the battery. If desktop computers can be used for hours at a time, and smartphones for minutes, the watch is being measured in seconds. Apple is suggesting developers design their applications to be used for no longer than 10 seconds at a time.Flipkart of India, to Bolster Its Tech Credentials, Hires Former Google Executive: Despite having raised billions of dollars and attaining a valuation of over $10 billion, the Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart isn’t necessarily the biggest name in Silicon Valley. Yet with its latest hire, the company is hoping to signal that it too can be a player. Flipkart plans to announce on Wednesday that it has hired Punit Soni, a former Google executive who most recently was a senior vice president for product management at Motorola Mobility when it was owned by Google. By tapping Mr. Soni to oversee Flipkart’s current and future products — and, in particular, their design and who is hired to design them — the e-commerce company means to show that it wants to attract top-level employees. “This really raises the bar for hiring talent,” Mukesh Bansal, the head of Flipkart’s commerce platform, said in a telephone interview. As the tech industry takes note of the rise of giants like the Alibaba Group of China, Flipkart’s executives are eager to show that India and its booming Internet sector are worth watching as well. Flipkart has become something like an Alibaba for the subcontinent, with Mr. Bansal saying that his company controls almost half of the country’s online shopping market. Yet when Mr. Soni announced his departure from Google last fall, around the time that it sold Motorola Mobility to Lenovo of China, he said in an interview that Flipkart wasn’t even on his radar screen. At Motorola Mobility, he had served as a public face for the phone maker, especially in terms of discussing its products and plans with the public on the Google+ social network. But he was on the Indian company’s radar, ever since the two collaborated on bringing Motorola phones onto Flipkart’s sales platforms. Initially, he didn’t take the approach by Flipkart seriously. But when he traveled to India to observe the company’s operations firsthand, he said, his eyes opened. He went to one of the market operator’s warehouses and trucking systems, watching fellow Indians working jobs that they never could have had before. “I could see how the spread of an organized e-commerce system was actually changing people’s lives,” Mr. Soni said. “It was probably that evening that I realized this was not just a run-of-the-mill job.” After spending time at Flipkart, he also was surprised to see what he called a strong engineering culture at the company. But he also plans to try and infuse his new employer with more of the values — and employees — of Silicon Valley.How Alibaba's U.S. IPO Got the Company Ordered Out of Taiwan: Documents give government evidence it needs to make the Chinese connection. Taiwan wants to kick Alibaba.com out because it's Chinese. Of course, everybody has known since its inception that Alibaba, the world's largest e-commerce operator, is Chinese. What's operating in Taiwan, however, is Alibaba.com Singapore E-Commerce Private Ltd. When that company was registered on April 9, 2008, Jack Ma's outfit was doing what it does in many countries, and indeed what many corporations do in many countries: operating via an offshore holding company. But in Taiwan, the difference between being Singaporean and Chinese is as stark as night and day. If your company is from Singapore, the U.S., Japan or just about anywhere, then Taiwan is open for business. If you're from mainland China: not so much. Then Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. filed for its record-breaking U.S. IPO. While Yahoo! Inc., Singapore's Temasek Holdings, Ma and everyone else got rich, Taiwan got a nice little present too. The hundreds of pages of pre-IPO documents, such as Alibaba's prospectus, contained the information Taiwan's investment commission needed to prove what it already thought it knew, Chang said. So now that it has evidence of the alleged Chineseness, it's ordered Alibaba out by the end of August. They could either sell the business or close it, Chang said. Alibaba though, doesn't appear ready to walk away. Taiwan is an important market, Ma told reporters in Taipei later the same day. It complied with the law when it entered, and complies with local laws wherever it goes, he said. \"We will actively communicate with related parties to clarify the issues and, if necessary, will take proper actions to protect the legitimate interests of Alibaba.com,\" the company said in a statement.Apple Inc will delay the start of production on a larger, 12.9-inch iPad until around September because of problems involving the display panel supply, said a report by Bloomberg News citing people familiar with the company's plans as saying. Production on the bigger tablet had been scheduled to begin this quarter, Bloomberg cited one of the people as saying.Alibaba to launch data center in the US, aimed at US operations of Chinese companies: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is launching a cloud computing hub in Silicon Valley on Wednesday, the e-commerce giant's first outside of China, underscoring its global ambitions in the face of stiff and entrenched competition. The new California data center marks the Chinese company's latest measured expansion onto American soil, and into a hotly contested U.S. market now dominated by Amazon.com Inc , Microsoft Corp and Google Inc. Alibaba's Aliyun cloud division intends the new data center to cater initially to Chinese companies with operations in the United States, including retail, Internet and gaming firms. It will later target U.S. businesses seeking a presence in both countries, Ethan Yu, a vice president at Alibaba who runs the international cloud business, told Reuters. Aliyun, which has been likened to a budding version of Amazon Web Services, began as part of the company's in-house technical infrastructure but has since expanded to lease processing and storage space for small and medium Internet businesses in China. While Alibaba dominates e-commerce in China, Aliyun, also known as Alibaba Cloud Computing, holds about a 23 percent market share in its home market. It faces both Chinese and foreign competitors, from carriers like China Telecom to Microsoft and Amazon. Its existing data centers span the Chinese cities of Hangzhou, Qingdao, Beijing, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Alibaba has big plans for Aliyun, which now accounts for about 1 percent of its revenue but supports its core e-commerce operation and will also play a pivotal role in the long run. Alibaba sees cloud computing as key to its plans to aggregate and analyze the vast quantities of data it collects, including on consumer behavior. Cloud computing and infrastructure was the company's fastest-growing business segment in the December quarter, increasing sales 85 percent to $58 million.Pizza Hut, Visa and Accenture prototype beacon-based pizza-ordering at Mobile World Congress: The firms are teaming up to test a system that lets you order and pay for your pie from your car, the companies announced Monday.Visa is demonstrating a proof-of-concept car at the ongoing Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Here's how it works: Visa's checkout payment system is integrated into the dashboard of the car. The driver uses voice control technology to place an order by accessing Pizza Hut's menu. Visa and Pizza Hut then validate your payment card information, and the pizza gets cooking. As you drive up to the nearest outlet, the restaurant is alerted to your arrival using Bluetooth-enabled \"beacon technology.\" That's when your car acts as your payment card, sends your details to Pizza Hut's point-of-sale system, and the transaction is completed. Finally, your pizza is delivered to your car. When it comes to security, the technology isn't any different from swiping your card at a terminal, according to McCarthy. Drivers would still have to opt in to the car manufacturer and network provider's privacy terms and conditions, he said. This isn't the first experiment at combining retail with connected cars. Automakers debuted a slew of new concepts at this year's International Consumer Electronics Show, as my colleague Hayley Tsukayama reported. For example, General Motors debuted a service that supplies drivers with coupons from sites like RetailMeNot for shopping discounts or lets them book last-minute hotel reservations using data from Priceline.com. GM conducted a pilot program for subscribers through OnStar, the carmaker's onboard service provider.Consolidation in the colocation business: NTT buys German data center operator, while Rackspace seeks tie-ups with Amazon, Microsoft: NTT: Japan's NTT Communications Corp said on Tuesday it has agreed to buy German data center firm e-shelter, becoming Europe's third biggest operator in the sector, in the latest in a series of overseas acquisitions to counter sluggish growth at home. NTT Communications, an unlisted division of Japanese telecom firm Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) (9432.T) didn't disclose the deal's financial terms. A person familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month the NTT unit was in talks to buy e-shelter for about 100 billion yen ($832 million). In a joint statement, NTT Communications and e-shelter said the Japanese firm will acquire 86.7 percent of the German company, founded in 2000. Operating data centers in four major cities in Germany including Berlin, as well as in Zurich and Vienna, e-shelter is Germany's biggest provider of data center services, they said. The European deal stretches the NTT brand further across the globe. In 2010, parent NTT bought South Africa's Dimension Data for 382 billion yen, while in 2013 NTT Communications signed deals with a combined value of 85.5 billion yen to take over two U.S. cloud computing firms, Virtela Technology Services and RagingWire Data Centers. Rackspace Rackspace Hosting Inc. is open to forging partnerships with large cloud-computing operators such as Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as the company seeks to bolster slowing revenue growth. Rackspace, which has faced price cuts by Amazon, Microsoft and other competitors, decided in September to reject approaches by multiple groups interested in a partnership or acquisition. Since then, Rhodes hinted that the company has had a team looking at supporting customers who are renting computing services from other providers. Rhodes confirmed on Monday that Rackspace intends to provide third-party support for users of rival cloud-computing services via a combination of people and custom-management software. “There are future versions of our model that will be more capital light and more service oriented,” Rhodes said.India’s Mobile Carriers Head Into $14 Billion Fight for Survival: What happens when a wireless operator with millions of customers loses the airwaves it needs to provide service? We may soon find out thanks to an unusual government auction taking place in India. The government will open the bidding Wednesday for airwaves already in use by the biggest carriers, including Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Vodafone Group Plc. They’ll have to compete to keep their licenses in the auction against Mukesh Ambani, who is India’s richest man and has signaled his determination by making the largest deposit of the competition. India’s approach, which is unlike what happens in the U.S., could mean seismic change for the world’s second-largest smartphone market. The airwaves up for auction serve more than 300 million customers and account for almost half of the $19 billion in combined revenue for the four largest operators. “For some of the telcos, renewal of spectrum is a key for survival,” said Nitin Soni, a director at Fitch Ratings in Singapore. Bharti, India’s biggest carrier, and second-ranked Vodafone could each spend as much as $4.5 billion for the spectrum, Soni said. Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. submitted a 45 billion-rupee ($726 million) bank guarantee, the most of any carrier, to participate in the auction, according to data from Mjunction Services Ltd., which is running the sale. Bharti Airtel was second with 43 billion rupees, and Vodafone gave a guarantee of 37 billion rupees. Any company losing previously held airwaves will probably have to shut down business in that region and abandon any investments or infrastructure it’s made. Companies also will lose revenue if they can’t switch to other bands, a move that would probably require new towers or technology. If companies shut down their business in a particular circle, their subscribers will have to look for new cellular operators, said Rishi Tejpal, an analyst at Gartner Inc. in New Delhi. “For some operators, it’s a do-or-die situation,” Tejpal said. “And with Reliance Jio in the picture, nobody knows their strategy.”Its official #2: Olacabs acquires TaxiForSure for $200M in cash and stock: Online cab booking service Olacabs.com run by Mumbai-based ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd, has acquired Bangalore-based Serendipity Infolabs Pvt Ltd, which runs rival service TaxiForSure for $200 million (Rs 1,240 crore) in a cash and stock deal, as per a company statement. The breakup of the cash component of the deal could not be immediately ascertained but with the stock swap, TaxiForSure investors—Accel Partners, Helion Venture Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners and Blume Ventures would get small minority equity stakes in Ola. Ola’s backers include SoftBank, Tiger Global, Matrix Partners, Sequoia Capital and Steadview Capital. Ola is already the top player in its business and TaxiForSure is believed to be among the other large firms in its space. Both are locked in a pitched battle against global giant Uber and other local players such as hybrid venture Meru. The company said TaxiForSure will continue to operate as a separate entity, at least for now, with Arvind Singhal (currently COO) being appointed CEO. Aprameya Radhakrishna and Raghunandan G, co-founders of TaxiForSure, will contribute in an advisory role for a certain period. This is the second largest deal in the consumer internet/e-commerce business behind Flipkart’s acquisition of Myntra last year. That deal was reportedly worth over $300 million. TaxiForSure is currently present in 47 cities with over 15,000 vehicles registered on its platform. Ola said the deal compliments the two companies, as TaxiForSure follows a different model of supply and distribution by working with cab operators compared to Ola’s model of working with drivers who own their own cabs.Alibaba and top Chinese university launch new education portal for MOOCs: One of China’s most highly regarded universities has partnered with the country’s biggest ecommerce company to create a new website for massive open online courses, or MOOCs. The generically named Chinese MOOCs was just launched by Peking University and Alibaba as schools around the country begin their new semesters following the Chinese New Year holiday (h/t to TechNode). Chinese MOOCs lists 26 courses, covering subjects in science, law, literature, music, and IT. The website lists six other universities that are apparently on board, including the University of Hong Kong, National Taiwan University, and Beijing Normal, but all the courses currently offered are from Peking University (note: Peking University is also known as Beijing University, or Beida, for short). Using a model similar to Coursera, Chinese MOOCs combines video lectures, quizzes, and other coursework to educate students, who can take courses for free and opt to pay for certificates upon completion. There’s no limit to the number of students per course.\n",
      "U.S. millennials post ‘abysmal’ scores in tech skills test, lag behind foreign peers: The test is called the PIAAC test. It was developed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, better known as the OECD. The test was meant to assess adult skill levels. It was administered worldwide to people ages 16 to 65. The results came out two years ago and barely caused a ripple. But recently ETS went back and delved into the data to look at how  millennials did as a group. After all, they’re the future – and, in America, they're poised to claim the title of largest generation from the baby boomers. U.S. millennials, defined as people 16 to 34 years old, were supposed to be different. They’re digital natives. They get it. High achievement is part of their makeup. But the ETS study found signs of trouble, with its authors warning that the nation was at a crossroads: “We can decide to accept the current levels of mediocrity and inequality or we can decide to address the skills challenge head on.” The challenge is that, in literacy, U.S. millennials scored higher than only three countries. In math, Americans ranked last. In technical problem-saving, they were second from the bottom. But surely America’s brightest were on top? Nope. U.S. millennials with master’s degrees and doctorates did better than their peers in only three countries, Ireland, Poland and Spain. Those in Finland, Sweden and Japan seemed to be on a different planet Top-scoring U.S. millennials – the 90th percentile on the PIAAC test – were at the bottom internationally, ranking higher only than their peers in Spain. The bottom percentile (10th percentile) also lagged behind their peers. And the gap between America’s best and worst was greater than the gap in 14 other countries. This, the study authors said, signaled America’s high degree of inequality. The study called into question America’s educational credentialing system. While few American test-takers lacked a high school degree, the United States didn’t perform any better than countries with relatively high rates of failing to finish high school. And our college graduates didn’t perform well, either. “Abysmal,” noted ETS researcher Madeline Goodman. “There was just no place where we performed well.”Airbnb looking to raise $1B at $20B valuation: Airbnb Inc. is raising money from investors in a financing round that would value the room-sharing service at $20 billion or more, people with knowledge of the deal said. Airbnb may bring in about $1 billion in the funding, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The closely held company, backed by venture-capital firms including Sequoia Capital, Greylock Partners and Founders Fund, was given a value of $10 billion last year in a round led by TPG Capital Management. Airbnb has raised more than $700 million before the latest financing. At $20 billion, San Francisco-based Airbnb would join the ranks of the most highly valued private U.S. technology companies, including Uber Technologies Inc., Space Exploration Technologies Inc., Snapchat Inc., Dropbox Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. It also would be worth almost seven times more than HomeAway Inc., a publicly traded vacation-rental site.Alibaba's direct-from-farm purchases, Baidu's smart chopsticks seek to reassure Chinese consumers amid food safety concerns: Controlling China’s sprawling food supply chain has proved a frustrating endeavor. Government regulators and state-owned agriculture companies have tried to tackle the problem in a number of ways — increasing factory inspections, conducting mass laboratory tests, enhancing enforcement procedures, even with prosecutions and executions — but food safety scandals still emerge too often. Chinese technology companies believe they can do it better. From the farm to the table, the country’s biggest players are looking to upgrade archaic systems with robust data collection, smartphone apps, online marketplaces and fancy gadgetry. The founder of the computer maker Lenovo started Joyvio, the agricultural company that tracks kiwis and other fruit from planting to delivery. The Internet giant Alibaba directly connects consumers with farmers via an online produce-delivery service. A gaming entrepreneur is running a pig farm on the side. And Baidu, the country’s leading search engine, is developing a “smart” chopstick that tests whether food is contaminated. City dwellers can buy directly from farmers through Jutudi, a pilot program created by Alibaba that has about 10,000 users. An e-commerce twist on the “buy local” movement, Jutudi lets users buy regular deliveries of vegetables and fruits from farms across China. Consumers can even pick their own plots in a sort of virtual farming, although deliveries may come from multiple places. Baidu’s smart chopsticks were supposed to be a joke for April Fools’ Day. The search engine giant published a fake advertisement for a set of chopsticks that would determine whether food had been cooked with gutter oil. The ad struck a chord, and it quickly went viral on Chinese social media sites. With such a strong response, Baidu decided to create a real product. Embedded with sensors, the chopsticks primarily test for gutter oil, but they also indicate pH levels and temperature. The product’s charger allows consumers to identify different fruits and vegetables as well as where they were grown and the calories they contain. The company is debating whether to add a feature that would indicate salinity, allowing users to determine whether mineral water is fake. Baidu is currently manufacturing a small batch of prototypes for testing. The company says it has not yet decided when to release the product or how much it will cost. Even so, it has already generated interest. Alibaba is tapping into consumers’ nostalgia for their rural roots with a heavy dose of marketing. The site features a Socialist Realist illustration of two women in a field of golden grain — harking back to the days of Mao Zedong, when farmers were lionized by propaganda. With images of shiny, red tomatoes, well-groomed pigs and other succulent fruits and vegetables, the program also promotes quality. Higher-end packages include tours of the farms.As Apple readies for smartwatch launch,..:For Apple, the hard part — making a smartwatch — is nearly over. Soon it will be time for the harder part: selling the long-anticipated Apple Watch to consumers who, so far, are not very excited about the idea of wearing computers on their bodies. The first batch of smartwatches from companies like Samsung Electronics, Motorola and LG did not sell well, nor were they particularly well reviewed. And wearable devices like the Google Glass eyewear that got mainstream attention — if not sales — were greeted with considerable skepticism. But Apple has been in this situation before. Most consumers didn’t care about computer tablets before Apple released the iPad, nor did they generally think about buying smartphones before the release of the iPhone. In both cases, the company overcame initial skepticism. Apple has marketed it as a device that can appeal to a range of customers like fitness buffs and luxury watch collectors. But it has limited its functions, making it more like a watch, more easily relatable than a tech doodad that happens to look like a watch, said Ben Bajarin, a consumer technology analyst for Creative Strategies. “This is a brand-new category. Most people have no frame of reference with a smartwatch,” said Mr. Bajarin. In late February, Apple sent out invitations to the media for an event to remind people about the best features of the watch and share some new details about the product, according to two people with knowledge of the event. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, is expected to be the host. Apple is expected to say more about price. The starting price for a basic Apple Watch is $350. Apple has not yet said how much people will have to pay for higher-end models, like the Apple Watch Edition, which is made of 18-karat gold, though watch enthusiasts estimate that it will cost upward of $10,000...Huawei unveils its own high-end smartwatch in an effort to beat Apple to the punch: China’s Huawei Technologies Co. unveiled its first smart watch that is aimed at the higher end of the wearables market, a week before Apple Inc. is expected to host an event to present a rival device. The 42-millimeter (1.6-inch) diameter luxury watch will be the world’s first wearable with sapphire crystal glass, Richard Yu, chief executive officer of Huawei’s consumer business group, said at an event in Barcelona Sunday, ahead of the Monday opening of the Mobile World Congress. Yu also unveiled an upgrade to Huawei’s smart band, introduced at last year’s conference. Huawei, ranked fifth in global smartphone shipments during the third quarter, is focusing on higher-end smartphones that can rival Apple’s or models by Samsung Electronics Co. All have expanded into wearables. Apple on Thursday sent out invitations to an event on March 9 in San Francisco, where it will unveil details for the release of the Apple Watch, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The connected, fitness-tracking wristwatch is the first entirely new gadget line to debut since Tim Cook took the helm at the Cupertino, California-based company. For Huawei, this year’s upgrade in accessories comes after sales of higher-end smartphones helped revenue rise about 20 percent in 2014 and operating profit improve. The maker of phone-network gear that also competes against the likes of Ericsson AB, has also been widening its product portfolio as it works toward a goal of achieving $70 billion in revenue by 2018, from $46 billion last year.Quantity and value of data is an overlooked benefit to delaying an IPO: It’s taking longer for startups to get to IPO, but that’s not necessarily bad news for investors in private companies. Why? Because startups today aren’t just valuable for their future exit potential, but for the proprietary data they produce while still private. Market statistics clearly show companies are staying private longer. The average time to IPO has doubled to nine years today from four in 1999, and the median amount raised prior to IPO has increased steadily from $48 million in 2008 to $101 million in 2013. Of the 100 largest VC rounds in history, 90 have occurred in the last five years. There are several reasons startups are staying private longer, including volatile public markets, healthy secondary markets, and a preference by some for mega-M&As. Whatever the reason startups don’t seek IPOs early, there is a real and often overlooked benefit to investors when startups stay private longer – the value of their data.The future of health care is a dongle attached to your smartphone: app-based diagnostics are taking off The latest development in this new direct-to-consumer health model is a new breakthrough from a team of biomedical engineering researchers at Columbia University in New York City that makes it possible to test for both HIV and syphilis in 15 minutes after hooking a plastic dongle into your smartphone’s headphone jack. You simply insert a pinprick of blood onto a disposable plastic collector, connect the plastic collector to a microfluidic chip used to analyze the sample and insert the chip with the blood sample into the dongle. Once you’ve logged into an app, your smartphone can start to determine the presence of HIV or syphilis in your blood and display the results on your smartphone’s screen 15 minutes later. More than its ease of use, the cost factor of the dongle is what makes it possible to speculate that this type of smartphone diagnostics could one day lead to a new direct-to-consumer model for health care. The equipment needed to perform a laboratory-quality HIV test can cost upwards of $18,450 apiece. Contrast that to the cost of a cheap plastic dongle, which costs an estimated $34 to make. That makes it possible to imagine a future where tests are faster, simpler and cheaper than anything available today. What makes the lab-on-a-smartphone so innovative is that, even though you’re significantly reducing cost, you’re not sacrificing power. The results delivered by the new device suggest that a full laboratory-quality immunoassay can be run on a smartphone accessory. Moreover, in a small field study in Rwanda, the team of researchers found that patient preference for the dongle was 97 percent compared to laboratory-based testWhy the U.S. Has Fallen Behind in Internet Speed and Affordability: Downloading a high-definition movie takes about seven seconds in Seoul, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Zurich, Bucharest and Paris, and people pay as little as $30 a month for that connection. In Los Angeles, New York and Washington, downloading the same movie takes 1.4 minutes for people with the fastest Internet available, and they pay $300 a month for the privilege, according to The Cost of Connectivity, a report published Thursday by the New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute. The report compares Internet access in big American cities with access in Europe and Asia. Some surprising smaller American cities — Chattanooga, Tenn.; Kansas City (in both Kansas and Missouri); Lafayette, La.; and Bristol, Va. — tied for speed with the biggest cities abroad. In each, the high-speed Internet provider is not one of the big cable or phone companies that provide Internet to most of the United States, but a city-run network or start-up service. The reason the United States lags many countries in both speed and affordability, according to people who study the issue, has nothing to do with technology. Instead, it is an economic policy problem — the lack of competition in the broadband industry. “It’s just very simple economics,” said Tim Wu, a professor at Columbia Law School who studies antitrust and communications and was an adviser to the Federal Trade Commission. “The average market has one or two serious Internet providers, and they set their prices at monopoly or duopoly pricing.”India Startup Action: Five startups showcased at Techcircle E-commerce Forum 2015: Pumpkart.com: It is an online store for agricultural and domestic pumps.

Local stores list their products on our marketplace and the firm handles distribution for them.Apple suffers shock loss in gaming patent infringement suit, ordered to pay $533M to small Texas firm; will appeal: (more coverage here and here)Apple Inc. was told to pay $532.9 million after a federal jury said the company’s iTunes software used a Texas company’s patented inventions without permission. Closely held Smartflash LLC, which claimed that Apple infringed three patents, was seeking $852 million in damages, while Apple said it was worth $4.5 million at most. A federal jury in Tyler, Texas, where Smartflash is based, on Tuesday rejected Apple’s arguments that it didn’t use the inventions and that the patents were invalid. The dispute is over digital rights management and inventions related to data storage and managing access through payment systems. Smartflash claimed that iTunes used the inventions in applications such as Game Circus LLC’s Coin Dozer and 4 Pics 1 Movie. Apple pledged to appeal. “Smartflash makes no products, has no employees, creates no jobs, has no U.S. presence, and is exploiting our patent system to seek royalties for technology Apple invented,” said Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman. “We refused to pay off this company for the ideas our employees spent years innovating and unfortunately we have been left with no choice but to take this fight up through the court system.” In asking for $852 million, Smartflash argued it was entitled to a percentage of sales of Apple’s devices, including the iPhone, iPad and Mac computers, that were used to access iTunes. It claimed that Apple had intentionally infringed the patents, in part because one of its executives had been given a briefing on the technology more than a decade ago. “Apple doesn’t respect Smartflash’s inventions,” the company’s lawyer, John Ward of Ward & Smith in Longview, Texas, told the jury. “Not a single witness could be bothered with reviewing the patent.”China's state procurement agency pushes to buy local; has dropped several global brands from approved lists - Cisco, McAfee and Citrix worst hit: China has dropped some of the world's leading technology brands from its approved state purchase lists, while approving thousands more locally made products, in what some say is a response to revelations of widespread Western cybersurveillance. Others put the shift down to a protectionist impulse to shield China's domestic technology industry from competition. Chief casualty is U.S. network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O), which in 2012 counted 60 products on the Central Government Procurement Center's (CGPC) list, but by late 2014 had none, a Reuters analysis of official data shows. Smartphone and PC maker Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has also been dropped over the period, along with Intel Corp's (INTC.O) security software firm McAfee and network and server software firm Citrix Systems (CTXS.O). The number of products on the list, which covers regular spending by central ministries, jumped by more than 2,000 in two years to just under 5,000, but the increase is almost entirely due to local makers. The number of approved foreign tech brands fell by a third, while less than half of those with security-related products survived the cull. An official at the procurement agency said there were many reasons why local makers might be preferred, including sheer weight of numbers and the fact that domestic security technology firms offered more product guarantees than overseas rivals.Buggy Bluetooth and unreliable voice recognition systems are now top drivers of car-buyer dissatisfaction, JD Power survey reveals: As communications systems proliferate in cars, they are becoming the biggest source of aggravation for owners, according to a study by the market research firm J.D. Power. From buggy Bluetooth systems to voice recognition systems that do not recognize voices, the problems with in-car computer systems have surpassed excessive wind noise as the most-cited issue. Of owners who had problems with their Bluetooth systems, 55 percent said their vehicle would not recognize their phone and 31 percent said the phone would not automatically connect when they entered the vehicle. The No. 2 problem was voice recognition systems misinterpreting commands. Effective voice recognition is seen as a critical function in cars if consumers are to be discouraged from distracted driving. Google and Apple are poised to enter the market widely, with new dashboard computer systems that will allow consumers to use their smartphones. The study also showed that technology was playing an increasingly important role in buying decisions. Fifteen percent of new-car buyers said they avoided a model because it lacked certain technological features, up from 4 percent in last year’s study. The study covered 177 specific problems grouped into eight major vehicle systems like exterior, seats, steering, suspension, braking and engine and transmission. J.D. Power then ranked brands by the number of problems reported per 100 vehicles; the lower the number of problems, the higher the ranking.Uber is offering UberX free in Seoul in a bid to defuse regulatory pressure; also faces potential of IP blockage in India: Global online car hire service major Uber’s IP address may get blocked in India if it does not obtain a radio taxi licence to ply its cabs in the national capital, according to a The Economic Times report citing unnamed Delhi Transport Department official. This will effectively shut down the company’s operations across all 11 cities in India. U.S. taxi service provider Uber Technologies Inc on Wednesday said it will make its low-cost uberX ride-sharing service available free of charge in Seoul, in its second bid this month to operate legally in South Korea. Uber started charging a fee last year for the taxi-like service, which matches passengers via a smartphone app with private drivers who do not hold commercial transport licenses. Prosecutors subsequently indicted Uber's chief executive, Travis Kalanick, as well as its South Korean unit for violating a law prohibiting individuals or firms without proper commercial licenses from providing or facilitating transportation services. \"We want to actively work towards a consensus, and the first step to that process is switching off the fare,\" Uber's head of north Asia Allen Penn said in a statement. Uber proposed a new registration system for its drivers in South Korea earlier this month in a bid to operate legally. But the transport ministry rejected the proposal and said it would stop the company offering its services. Uber has been the subject of similar regulatory ire in countries around the world, even as it expanded into more than 290 cities. In January, the city of Seoul declared Uber's services illegal and started offering rewards of up to 1 million won ($911) for people who reported private drivers providing transport through the company.IBM announces plans to build corporate cloud centers in India and other new geographies; IBM shrank employee count 12% last year but is hiring in analytics, the cloud and security: IBM Monday announced at a conference in Las Vegas a series of technologies and investments designed to win business customers over to IBM’s version of modern computing. IBM also said it was opening corporate cloud centers in Australia, Canada, India and Italy. These follow a company effort to best Amazon Web Services, Google and Microsoft by renting computation in more locations. “Mega clouds are great, but not that great if you’re not in their geography,” Mr. Diaz said. Rebalancing workforce: IBM’s employee count shrank 12 percent last year as Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has tried to reinvent the 103-year-old technology giant into a more nimble competitor. It’s the second straight annual drop for IBM’s workforce, the first two-year decline since 1993 and 1994 when the company was pushed to the edge of bankruptcy. Rometty has been seeking to transform International Business Machines Corp. to keep up with newer competitors in an industry undergoing what she’s called “unprecedented change.” IBM had 379,592 employees at the end of 2014, down 12 percent from a year earlier when the company posted the first decline in a decade, according to a filing Tuesday. Excluding a 35,000 reduction from divestitures, headcount fell about 3.9 percent last year. To help boost earnings-per-share, Rometty has fired and furloughed workers, cut IBM’s tax rate and bought back shares. She has also offloaded less-profitable business units last year, like the low-end server business sold to Lenovo Group Ltd., a customer-care business and the chip-making unit, which IBM paid Globalfoundries Inc. $1.5 billion to take off its hands. “IBM has 15,000 open positions right now, many in areas such as analytics, cloud, security where we are rebalancing skills to meet the evolving needs of our clients,” said Ian Colley, a spokesman for IBM.Google Guns for Apple in Mobile Payments Race: Google announced on Monday that it has cut a deal with three wireless carriers — AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon — as well as their jointly-owned payments company, Softcard, to have its Google Wallet payment application preinstalled on Android phones sold by the carriers. As part of the deal, Google said, it acquired “technology and intellectual property” from Softcard. The move will allow Google to get its Wallet app in front of a whole lot more people, but it is facing an increasingly crowded field. Last week, Samsung acquired Loop Pay, signaling its move into mobile payments. Apple’s Apple Pay, meantime, has  been available for only a few months but has already signed up dozens of companies that report consumers are finally starting to warm to paying for things with their phones.Alibaba's online mutual fund is struggling as China's appetite for online financial products stagnates: Alibaba’s Yuebao, one of the largest online mutual funds in China, started to stagnate and even shrink in 2014. Assets fell from US$92 billion to US$87 billion in the third quarter of last year. A combination of heightened competition, stricter government regulations, and declining interest rates likely contributed to the fund’s dip.China’s appetite for online financial products has slowed dramatically, according to a report from the China Internet Network Information Center (via Xinhua). Products like online mutual funds, peer-to-peer loans, and insurance only showed 2 percent growth in the second half of last year. Between the time these products began to hit the market in early 2013 through the first half of 2014, CNNIC says 12.1 percent of Chinese internet users subscribed to or bought some sort of online financial product, but the rate of growth slowed in the second half of 2014 and only reached about 14 percent. As of December 2014, 78.5 million bought into these non-traditional finance options, up 1.5 million on the previous semester. The initial boom of consumers buying into online financial products stemmed from bottlenecks in the traditional banking system. In contrast to state-owned banks that cater more to businesses and state-owned enterprises, these privately owned and peer-to-peer alternatives offered a much lower barrier to entry. That includes no minimum deposits for mutual funds and loans for people without established credit ratings. Apple to spend $1.9 billion on 2 new European data centers: Apple Inc said it would spend 1.7 billion euros ($1.9 billion) to build two data centers in Europe that would be entirely powered by renewable energy and create hundreds of jobs. The company said the centers, in Ireland and Denmark, will power Apple's online services, including the iTunes Store, App Store, iMessage, Maps and Siri for customers across Europe. The investment is set to be evenly divided between the two countries, with the Irish government confirming that 850 million euros would be spent in Ireland. The two data centers are expected to begin operations in 2017.Watch out - Gmail’s Autocomplete is suggesting the wrong addresses: Sending email to the wrong person is probably among the top five most awkward things you can do in a professional context. Whether you’ve accidentally let confidential info slip to a third party or simply aired frustration to someone who doesn’t need to hear it, dealing with mis-sent email is never fun. Hence the frustration coming from Gmail power users dealing with an auto-complete bug in the recipient field. Over the last few days, a number of venture capital and startup folk have come forward with complaints ranging from mild frustration to anger: Google confirmed that there is in fact an issue in Gmail’s auto-complete function. A Google spokesperson gave us the following comment: “We’re aware of an issue with Gmail and auto-complete and currently investigating. Apologies for any inconvenience.”As Paris forms a special police unit to spot clandestine taxis; Uber gives drivers tips on how to avoid detection: Uber Technologies Inc. drivers in Paris are adding a new word to their vocabulary: Boers. That’s the nickname of a special police unit whose responsibilities include spotting clandestine taxis. The 70-person squad has now the added task of enforcing a taxi law that bans practices including some used by the car-hailing smartphone application’s UberPop rides with unlicensed chauffeurs. Since January, some 110 drivers have been handed tickets. The fines start from a few hundred euros and can theoretically reach several thousands, according to a police official, who asked not to be named citing department policy. In France, where Uber says it has signed up a million users -- including 250,000 for UberPop -- in just over three years, the crackdown is the latest episode in a long legal battle where cab drivers say the startup unfairly threatened their livelihoods. Uber disagrees with the ban, backed by a Paris judge who studied the taxi law and ruled in December not to block the service. To avoid police attention, at least seven UberPop drivers Bloomberg News spoke to in the past week said they had been told by the company not to position their smartphones in plain sight when running the app, and to ask passengers to ride in the front seat. They declined to give their full names for fear of reprimand by Uber. Uber’s Simphal confirmed those guidelines. The company also regularly e-mails newsletters to drivers with advice on regulation and other topics, he said. “We always support the drivers,” Simphal said, when asked whether Uber reimburses them for fine tickets.Circle of Life - LivingSocial spawns a new generation of startups even as it shrinks: The tendency for start-ups to give rise to other start-ups is a self-sustaining cycle that excites technology enthusiasts. It can create a concentration of companies that generate well-paying jobs and attract skilled workers, as well as give well-heeled financiers a reason to invest money in the region. Nowhere is this more evident than Silicon Valley, where high-growth technology companies spin off new ventures, recycle engineering talent and grab billions of dollars from the world’s biggest venture capitalists. It’s the kind of ecosystem, built over decades, that other locales now strive to emulate. LivingSocial’s ability to spawn a next generation of companies may be among its most significant contributions to the local economy, especially as its own promise to become one of the region’s banner tech companies has faded. After raising hundreds of millions of dollars from investors to expand globally, LivingSocial in recent years has shrunk from 4,000 to 1,300 employees worldwide and retreated from countries in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.Apple wants to start producing cars as soon as 2020, and is hiring accordingly: Apple Inc., which has been working secretly on a car, is pushing its team to begin production of an electric vehicle as early as 2020, people with knowledge of the matter said. The timeframe -- automakers typically spend five to seven years developing a car -- underscores the project’s aggressive goals and could set the stage for a battle for customers with Tesla Motors Inc. and General Motors Co. Both automakers are targeting a 2017 release of an electric vehicle that can go more than 200 miles on a single charge and cost less than $40,000. “That’s the inflection point -- the proving ground -- that brings on the electric age,” Steve LeVine, author of “The Powerhouse,” a book about the automotive battery industry, said on Bloomberg TV Thursday. “Now you have Apple coming in and this is critical mass. Was GM really going to be able to match Tesla? Apple can.” Apple, which posted record profit of $18 billion during the past quarter, has $178 billion in cash with few avenues to spend it. The Cupertino, California-based company’s research and development costs were $6.04 billion in the past year, and Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is facing increased pressure to return cash to shareholders. The CEO has been pushing the iPhone maker to enter new categories to further envelop users’ digital lives with Apple’s products and services. Apple’s possible foray into cars follows a similar path it’s taken to break into other industries. The company wasn’t the first to make a digital-music player or smartphone, and only entered those markets once it had a product that redefined those categories. hiring an auto team : A year and a half ago, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) had applied for just eight patents related to auto batteries. Recently, it has hired a bevy of engineers, just one of whom had already filed for 17 in his former career, according to a Thomson Reuters analysis. The recent spate of hires and patent filings reviewed by Reuters shows that Apple is fast building its industrial lithium-ion battery capabilities, adding to evidence the iPhone maker may be developing a car.Pinterest is in talks to raise $500M at valuation of $11B, twice its previous valuation: US-based visual discovery startup Pinterest Inc. is in talks to raise $500 million at a valuation of $11 billion, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal , citing sources. The new funding will more than double the valuation of the company from its last round, when it had raised $200 million at $5 billion valuation. To date, Pinterest has raised a total of $764 million in funding from SV Angel, Bessemer Venture Partners, Fidelity, Andreessen Horowitz, FirstMark Capital, and Valiant Capital Partners. In October 2013, Pinterest had raised $225 million led by Fidelity Investments at a valuation of $3.8 billion. Previously, the company had bagged $100 million from Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten.India startup action: Payments firm Citrus Pay crosses a milestone: $1B in gross transaction runrate: Citrus claims of having crossed $1 billion in gross transactions as a run rate from its 11 million registered users, according to a top executive of the company. It crossed the milestone in December which means it processed transactions worth over Rs 515 crore in that month. “We process more than 1.6 lakh transactions per day compared with 278 transactions in January 2011 when we started operating,” said Satyen Kothari, co-founder, Citrus. This means it is doing roughly 5 million transactions per month with an average ticket size of around Rs 1,000. It says it now has over 2,500 merchants using its services and it is adding more than 100 every month. Airtel, IndiGo, Sun Direct, Tata AIA, Fun Cinemas, Pepperfry and Delhi Metro are among its clients. The firm charges 2.5 per cent fee of the transaction from the merchants, which means it is now generating around Rs 13 crore as net revenues a month. The firm has launched direct-to-consumer app which is a personal payments manager that tracks, pays & reminds users of their bills. Called Cube, it gives a dashboard on what’s late, what’s due and what’s already paid. “Most Indian pay about 8-10 bills every month. RBI has estimated that Indians pay 30 billion bills in a year. These could be paid by physical means or going online on different websites which is a waste of time. Going to banks for paying it is not meant for our fast moving lifestyle and so we came up with Cube,” said Kothari. “Besides paying bills, it can create analytical graphs that helps the user track spending habits, brings exhaustive billing history to the users fingertips and ‘automagically’ adds reminders for payments made by users,” he explained. For circumstances where users cannot pay through the app, the tracking history does not break as it also allows users to manage bills that are paid offline or on other sites by manually adding that data. The unique quotient is that it also allows users to track micro bills like maid’s salary etc and make notes. The app also allows users to ask friends or spouse to pay for it. Presently, the app operates in seven categories including mobile, DTH, power, credit card, data card, landline and gas and also other miscellaneous categories. This is the company’s second direct-to-consumer app. It had earlier launched an app called Death of Chutta which allows users to exchange money with friends. The money in that wallet can also be used to pay across 700 portals which Citrus has partnered. According to the founder, these products were launched for making India’s digital currency. The idea is also to gear up for the payments banking license, for which it has applied. “There are infinite things that we can do with the consumer’s money. Right now we are restricted to Rs 5000 per transaction and Rs 10,000 per month which really hits the ceiling to how much we can automate and innovate very fast. With the license, we can hold up to Rs 1 lakh,” said Kothari. In December 2013, the Mumbai-based company had raised about $5.5 million from econtext Asia Ltd, a Japanese online payments firm, and Beenos Asia Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of Japanese e-commerce and incubation company Netprice, with participation from existing investor Sequoia Capital. Prior to that, it has raised $1.8 million from Sequoia Capital in January 2012. Citrus competes with CCAvenues, ibibo Group’s PayU, One97’s Paytm Payments, ZaakPay and PayPal.HP becomes a reseller of networking equipment; move away from hardware in quest of software-company margins takes aim at Cisco: Hewlett-Packard said on Thursday that it would sell a new line of networking switches that are manufactured by a Taiwanese company and depend on Linux-based, open-source software from another company. HP, once at the center of high-tech manufacturing, will not make the new networking equipment but will act as a reseller, providing both online ordering and worldwide support for the product. It is the most consequential announcement from HP since its chief executive, Meg Whitman, announced last October that the company would split into two separate enterprises. One will be focused on business, and the other on consumer-type products. The networking move, firmly in the area of business technology, shows the type of changes HP and other older tech giants must make to survive in a transforming marketplace. In its last fiscal year, HP took in $2.6 billion from its proprietary networking business, which started in earnest in 2009. In the long term, cheap, open-source networking equipment could threaten HP’s existing business, particularly if the open-source products make expected gains in power and capability. HP is not the only networking equipment maker threatened by the changing marketplace. Cisco Systems is still by far the biggest maker of networking gear, with $47 billion in annual revenue, and it depends heavily on proprietary products. Networking gear has been considered an important part of HP’s future, however. “We see a shift,” said Mark Carroll, the chief technology officer of HP’s networking business. “The traditional market, the one-vendor market, is transitioning to many suppliers.” By offering an open-source product consisting largely of mass-market chips, the thinking runs, HP will be in a position to dislodge Cisco. Mr. Carroll called HP’s embrace of open source “an evolution” of his company’s strategy. “You look at which markets are growing and go there,” he said. Sold complex and proprietary combinations of servers, data storage, networking and software for decades, customers are now demanding systems that can be arranged in different ways, with open-source software they can tinker with in-house. The new methods promise advantages in speed, cost and innovation. In addition, new entrants are affecting the business. Companies now rely on Amazon’s computing-rental business for many needs. Facebook last week announced an open-source switch intended to undermine prices and speed innovation in the industry. Mr. Carroll said HP “absolutely” sees Facebook’s switch “playing in the same space” as HP’s open-source networking. The actual manufacturer of the HP boxes, Accton Technology, has been making gear for HP for 20 years. The open-source software will be supplied by Cumulus Networks, which last year announced it would supply Dell with software for inexpensive networking boxes. The Cumulus relationship with HP is not exclusive, and HP could add more suppliers in the future. HP “wants the software and service margins and to get rid of being in the hardware business,” said JR Rivers, chief executive and one of the founders of Cumulus. “You’ll see other networking providers get on board with this.” The initial target customers for the product, available in March, are telecommunications and financial companies. Both use a lot of cloud computing, mobility, social media and big-data resources in their data centers.Being fully transparent in pricing can be costly, finds online ticket seller StubHub : In January 2014, StubHub attempted something radical. Addressing the frustration of its customers, the online ticket reseller began including its bevy of fees in the first price a customer sees, rather than tacking them on just before purchase. Now when you click “buy,” a pair of tickets listed at $100 will cost $100, not $125. According to StubHub, customers said they wanted—and say they love—the transparency. But the change hasn’t improved sales. Because StubHub, which generated $500 million in revenue last year, baked its fees into the list price, its tickets looked more expensive than those of rivals. Sales for the company fell more than 10 percent in the months that followed the pricing change, according to Wedbush Securities, as competitor Ticketmaster gained market share. StubHub further trimmed its profit margins by cutting its take from each sale. By November, Chris Tsakalakis, who championed the new pricing, was out as president. (He declined to comment.) Still, the ticket reseller has stuck with the policy, which spokesman Glenn Lehrman says is among the most popular moves the 15-year-old company has ever made.Flipkart is valued at more than AirBnB, as billion-dollar startups proliferate; as Snapchat proves, though, these rankings change very quickly though: Flipkart Internet Pvt. is now valued at $11 billion, making it the fifth-most valuable startup on the list. That puts Flipkart ahead of Airbnb, a company that is challenging the business models of global hotel giants with its online room rentals, and online storage firm Dropbox. These rankings are volatile though: Less than 12 months after investors valued Snapchat, the red-hot messaging app, at about $10 billion, the start-up is again in the market for money — and poised to nearly double that valuation. A range of other popular start-ups are also poised to propel their net worths to similar multibillion-dollar heights, including the virtual scrapbooking service Pinterest and the ride-hailing app Lyft. Uber, Lyft’s top competitor, has raised more than $3 billion in the last year and now has an eye-popping valuation of $40 billion. Giant sums of money and sky-high valuations are nothing new in the technology industry. But the latest burst of activity has put on clear display the frenzied pace of investors, who are eager to catch the next blockbuster company like Facebook. The action is also again spurring talk that overeager investors are poised to relive the dot-com boom and bust at the turn of the century, when overinflated start-ups led to a quick and painful downturn. For investors, the hunt is for the next proverbial so-called unicorn, a nascent business worth $1 billion or more — on paper, at least. Just last year, 38 privately held companies backed by venture capital joined the billion-dollar club, putting the membership of that group at 54, according to the data firm CB Insights. Digi-Capital, a mobile Internet advisory firm, estimates that the total value of mobile Internet start-ups worth $1 billion or more increased $28 billion in just the last quarter of 2014.Uber expands Series E by $1B to $2.8B; Baidu among investors as Alibaba invests in rival Lyft: Facing overwhelming demand from institutional investors, Uber has expanded its Series E round of venture financing by $1 billion, according to documents filed Wednesday with the Delaware secretary of state, bringing the total capacity for the round up to $2.8 billion. The move, which was confirmed by Uber, occurred just weeks after the company closed a $1.2 billion round of financing. At the time, Uber said it had left capacity for about $600 million in additional strategic investments, according to a Delaware filing. The company is incorporated in Delaware and based in San Francisco. But the appetite for a piece of Uber has proved to be greater than the company had imagined. The $600 million was quickly oversubscribed, and Uber decided to raise the amount. Baidu, the Chinese Internet giant, accounts for part of the additional investment beyond the $1.2 billion round. The most recent expansion is on top of some $4 billion Uber raised, including a recent $1.6 billion round of convertible debt financing from the clients of the private wealth arm of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank previously confirmed. Uber’s $40 billion valuation, extraordinary by any private technology company’s standards, remains unchanged since the company announced the first part of the round in December. Uber is one of the most richly valued private technology start-ups, second only to Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer. Meanwhile, Uber’s largest United States competitor is also raising money. Lyft, identified by its signature pink mustache logo, is trying to raise at least $250 million in private capital, with participation from at least one previous investor, the Alibaba Group of China.Snapdeal aims for $2B in fashion in 2015; acquires designer apparel e-tailer Exclusively.com: E-commerce major Snapdeal.com, run by Delhi-based Jasper Infotech Pvt Ltd, has acquired Indian luxury and lifestyle products site Exclusively.com (formerly Exclusively.in). The financials of the deal are not disclosed. According to Snapdeal, the acquisition has been made with an aim to strengthen its fashion business and reach $2 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV) in the category in 2015. “We have witnessed a surge in the demand from consumers across the country for premium and luxury products. However, given that access to luxury brands is limited in our country, we have acquired Exclusively to provide our users with access to a range of aspirational, high end products and services,” said Kunal Bahl, co-founder and CEO, Snapdeal.com. As part of the acquisition, Exclusively will complement Snapdeal’s existing ecosystem and will provide a consolidated offering for the luxury and lifestyle shopper. It will continue to function as an independent site and all aspects of Exclusively’s online shopping experience will remain intact — with new collection and service augmentations in the pipeline. Snapdeal on the other hand will help the company scale up and expand its current business and reach. As of now, Exclusively retails products from designers like Manish Malhotra, Tarun Tahiliani, Manish Arora, Anita Dongre, Rohit Bal,  Shivan & Narresh, Gaurav Gupta, JJ Valaya, Ritu Kumar, Varun Bahl, and Neeta Lulla, to name a few. This year, the company plans to launch leading international luxury brands and designers on its site. Founded in June 2010, Exclusively.com offers products in a number of categories including apparels, jewellery, handbags and accessories. While it started off targeting the US and the UK markets, the company now caters to the Indian market. Interestingly, the company was reported to have been acquired by fashion portal Myntra.com in 2012. At the time, Myntra had acquired Shersingh.com. The two sites (Shersingh.com and Exclusively.com) were functioning under the same umbrella back then. Exclusively.com could not be reached out to for an immediate response.Samsung Buys LoopPay, a Competitor to Apple’s Mobile Wallet: Samsung, the South Korean technology giant, announced Wednesday it had acquired LoopPay, a mobile payments company, signaling its interest in controlling smartphone-based purchases. The move comes just months after the release of Apple Pay, Apple’s mobile payments product, which allows consumers to buy things with little more than a wave of a smartphone. Though it has been available for only a handful of months, Apple Pay has gained significant traction with retailers and consumers. Whole Foods, the high-end grocery store, said it had processed thousands of Apple Pay transactions. Apple has also persuaded dozens of credit card issuers to sign up to support Apple Pay. LoopPay, however, believes its reach will extend far beyond that of Apple Pay. LoopPay’s underlying technology relies on a magnetic transmission sent from a user’s phone to a merchant’s payment terminal, mimicking a credit card swipe. The technology, according to LoopPay, can be accepted in more than 90 percent of existing point-of-sale terminals. It is unclear if LoopPay will work on chip-and-pin terminals, which use a more secure form of credit card technology and are being widely phased in this year. Apple Pay relies on near-field communication technology, which Apple says is available at approximately 220,000 American locations. MST v NFC:  LoopPay uses magnetic secure transmission (MST) tech works with around 90 percent of existing payment terminals currently deployed in U.S. stores. “If you look at other competitor solutions in mobile payments [Apple Pay included], it’s actually based on near-field technology, which has very limited coverage in the U.S. We see the MST technology that LoopPay owns has a lot of potential to really solve the end-user coverage issues with respect to point-of-sale terminals.” Samsung spotted the potential early: LoopPay launched a Kickstarter project in November of 2013, and was contacted by Samsung only “shortly thereafter,” according to Graylin.Chinese online education startup raises $100M: On the eve of the Chinese new year, online education platform 17zuoye has announced that it has raised a series D round worth US$100 million, according to Duozhi. This brings the company’s total valuation to US$600 million. The round was led by H Capital (which also invested in 17zuoye’s series C), and other investors included Temasek, Yuri Milner/DST, and Lei Jun’s Shunwei (which has invested in every 17zuoye round starting with its series A). 17zuoye is an online learning platform for students K-12, as well as teachers and parents. The name means “homework together” in Chinese, and the site aims to serve as a nexus for all three groups to facilitate the educational experience, focusing on English and Math classes. For example, for students one service it offers is an automated system that allows them to record English sentences and get instant feedback on pronunciation. Teachers can then listen to their students’ recordings at any time. Parents can even get real-time reports on their kids via WeChat. Online education is a hot market in China right now, but 17zuoye, which was founded in 2007, has shown especially explosive growth. Two years ago the site had just over 1 million students; now it has more than 7 million. In July of last year alone, for example, the site added more than 130,000 students to its rolls.Microsoft seeks to re-invent itself: has suddenly gotten serious with mobile. This is the same Microsoft that spent almost a half-decade trying to offer a credible alternative to Apple’s iPhone and mobile devices running Google’s Android. And it’s the same Microsoft that paid more than $7 billion to buy Nokia’s once-mighty handset business, only to see its mobile business sink further. The company now clings precariously to a 3 percent share of new smartphone sales. Make no mistake, Microsoft still wants its mobile operating system, Windows, to be the software in our smartphones. But mobile developers continue to focus on making apps for Apple or Android devices instead, making Windows phones an increasingly hard sell. That reality has finally sunk in at Microsoft, and a new strategy is afoot. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, took the top job at the company about a year ago, he signaled that the company’s priorities were shifting. Microsoft, he said, was in a “mobile-first, cloud-first world.” Since then, the company has brought more of its apps and services to the Apple and Android devices people actually use, rather than the ones Microsoft would like them to use — those that run Windows. What’s even more surprising is that Microsoft’s heart seems to be in the effort. Over the last several months, Microsoft has been taking up more and more space on my own iPhone’s home screen. I’ve installed mobile versions of its Office apps as well as OneDrive, the company’s answer to Dropbox, Google Drive and other cloud storage services.Winds of economic change in India: as rivals falter, India’s economy is surging ahead: China’s economy is slowing. Brazil is struggling as commodity prices plunge. Russia, facing Western sanctions and weak oil revenue, is headed into a recession. As other big developing markets stumble, India is emerging as one of the few hopes for global growth. The stock market and rupee are surging. Multinational companies are looking to expand their Indian operations or start new ones. The growth in India’s economy, long a laggard, just matched China’s pace in recent months. India is riding high on the early success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and a raft of new business-friendly policies instituted in his first eight months. Small factories no longer need to shut down every year for government inspectors to spend a day checking boilers. Foreign investment rules have been relaxed for insurers, military contractors and real estate companies. A broad tax overhaul is underway. Renewed optimism from outside investors is spurring business expansion in cities around the country like Tiruppur, a hub of India’s yarn and textile industry. “Most of the factories in Tiruppur are doubling or tripling their capacity, and these are huge factories,” said Pritam Sanghai, the director of Arjay Apparel Industries.Snapchat seeking $500M in funding, at $19B valuation; would make it the 3rd most valuable venture-backed firm, after Xiaomi and Uber: (More coverage here and here) Snapchat is looking to raise as much as $500 million in a new funding round that would value the mobile messaging company at up to $19 billion, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. The latest valuation is a massive increase for the company, which Facebook Inc offered to buy for $3 billion in late 2013. Snapchat's previous funding round, completed late last year, valued the company at more than $10 billion. Executives of the company, which allows its more than 100 million users to send messages that disappear after a few seconds, are in advanced talks with fund managers, the person told Bloomberg. (bloom.bg/1AiWtif) The investments being discussed would value Snapchat between $16 billion and $19 billion overall, Bloomberg reported. The drastic increase in valuation comes as Snapchat continues to add to its active user base and extends its service. Last month it added videos and articles by mainstream media outlets such as CNN and ESPN, bringing Snapchat into closer competition with Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc. It is also the latest evidence of a surge in venture capital financing for technology companies, that has produced some eye-popping valuations. Even at $19 billion, Snapchat would only be the third-most valuable tech startup that does not trade its shares publicly. According to research firm CB Insights, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is worth $46 billion and app-based taxi service Uber is valued at $41 billion.Kickstarter secret to its reputation for accurate reviews: Lots of human intervention: Kickstarter Sheds Some Light On The Mechanics Of Its Semi-Automated Review Process Kickstarter has provided a look at how the reconfigured review system the put in place last year has worked out for them, providing some counterarguments to the opinion held in some corners of the Internet that Kickstarter has done away with a review system entirely, throwing open the gates to the wildlings of the north and other nefarious characters. In fact, Kickstarter says that the new process still results in the vast majority of projects submitted getting in front of human eyes, based on over six months’ worth of data. The system uses an algorithm as a first line of automated review, which is designed to select for things that are mostly cookie-cutter and overwhelmingly likely to get the nod form a real person anyway, according to the site. That means that of 69,015 submissions made since the introduction of this system, 27,897 were cleared by the algorithm for direct activation, and a further 6,265 of those actually requested human feedback from Kickstarter before pressing the big green button, meaning only 31 percent of projects launched without human involvement post-approval process change. That leaves 69 percent of projects benefiting from some kind of human intervention, and Kickstarter wants users to know that the human side is still a key part of what it’s offering. The blog post detailing the pool of stats from Yancey Strickler also talks about how the algorithm in use is continually being refined, and the purpose of it in the first place was to free up human reviewer time to give them more attention to offer help when and where it’s most needed. A recent investigative report from Yahoo! Tech’s Dan Tynan found that Kickstarter was the most resistant to attempts to create fake funding campaigns aimed at potentially defrauding backers, and with this much human intervention it begins to make sense why. But that doesn’t change the fact that Kickstarter can often resemble a pre-order mechanism, despite the fact that it very clearly isn’t.Apple orders 5-6M watches from its Asian suppliers: Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has asked its Asian suppliers to make 5-6 million units of its three Apple Watch models for the first-quarter, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Taiwan-based Quanta Computer Inc (2382.TW), the sole assembler of the Apple Watch, started mass production earlier this year to get ready for an April launch, the Journal said. (on.wsj.com/17MpwkR) Thousands will work round the clock during the Chinese New Year holidays at Quanta's factory in Changshu, China, the newspaper reported, quoting one person. Apple said it does not comment on rumor or speculation. The iPhone maker's shares rose as much as 1.9 percent to a record $129.45 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday morning. The entry-level Apple Watch Sport model accounts for half the production order, while the mid-tiered Apple Watch will count for a third, one person told the WSJ. The high-end Apple Watch Edition with 18-karat gold casing, is expected to have relatively small orders in the first quarter, but Apple plans to produce more than 1 million units per month in the second quarter, the Journal reported, citing the person. The Apple Watch, starting at $349, can receive phone calls and messages, play music, serve as a digital wallet to pay for goods and monitor heart rates via special sensors.Samsung has $56B in cash, and is looking to do acquisitions rather than return money to investors: Samsung Electronics Co Ltd aims to use its $56 billion cash pile to fund growth including acquisitions, the tech giant's investor relations chief said, even as more shareholders clamor for bigger dividends. While the South Korean company's profit declined in 2014 for the first time in three years as its lead in smartphones was challenged by Apple Inc, investors were cheered by a 40 percent dividend boost and its first share buyback since 2007. But Robert Yi, Samsung's head of investor relations, signaled that shareholders should not expect the same in 2015 as the company keeps its focus on growth. \"Dividends and other forms of shareholder returns are responsibilities that the company has for shareholders, so we will make efforts to meet them. But our primary objective is growth and that is what we are communicating to our shareholders,\" Yi told Reuters in an interview. Samsung has become an increasingly active shopper, striking 10 deals in two years. Even so, its purchases have been small, prompting calls from some investors for bigger deals to revive growth momentum. \"We are primarily focused on M&A deals for companies that would be good fits to Samsung's current businesses, and we believe that know-how and experience accrued from such transactions will make bigger M&A deals possible going forward,\" Yi said. Samsung Electronics held cash of 61.8 trillion won ($56.14 billion) at the end of 2014.Wi-fi first telcos might be about to disrupt the telecom business: It would not be an insult to say Republic Wireless and FreedomPop are obscure little companies. But they dream big. The two companies are at the forefront of a tantalizing wireless communications concept that has proved hard to produce on a big scale: Reduce cellphone costs by relying on strategically placed Wi-Fi routers. And when there are no routers available, fall back on the traditional cellular network. They have been at this for nearly five years with mixed success. The companies say they are already profitable and gradually adding subscribers. But they are tiny — both say their customers are in the hundreds of thousands. Verizon Wireless, by comparison, has more than 100 million. Still, the upstarts have been trailblazers, proof that alternative wireless networks are feasible and maybe even profitable. Now some giant companies look to be following their lead. Last month, Cablevision announced a phone service that would be powered entirely by Wi-Fi, for $30 a month, while a traditional wireless contract costs around $100 a month. Google has also been working on a cellphone service that relies heavily on Wi-Fi, according to people briefed on the company’s plans. For consumers, all this could be very good news. The big American carriers — Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile USA — have not been worried about their Wi-Fi-powered competitors. But Cablevision and Google could force them to pay attention. And an industry already engaged in a price-cut war could be compelled to go even lower to keep the upstarts at bay. “Wi-Fi first is a massive disrupter to the current cost structure of the industry,” said Stephen Stokols, chief executive of FreedomPop. “That’s going to be a big shock to the carriers.” The concept championed by the two little companies in their nationwide services is surprisingly simple. The traditional wireless carriers operate their services with cell towers, but occasionally in areas with extra heavy traffic they resort to Wi-Fi to bear some of the load. FreedomPop and Republic Wireless do the opposite. They offer services that rely primarily on Wi-Fi networks, and in areas without Wi-Fi, customers can pull a signal from regular cell towers.Infosys acquires SaaS provider Panaya in deal valued at $200M: Consulting and IT services provider Infosys announced today that it will acquire Panaya, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software company. Worth an enterprise value of about $200 million, the deal is expected to close by the end of March.Infosys, which is based in Bengaluru, India, said that it will integrate technology from Panaya’s CloudQuality suite to bring automation to some of its software. CloudQuality helps businesses test changes to SAP, Oracle EBS, and Salesforce software by identifying functions that might break and providing potential solutions including code corrections. Infosys, one of India’s largest software exporters, is currently in the midst of revamping its strategy as it faces challenges including slower revenue growth than competitors like HCL Tech and TCS, and the departure of several key executives. Sikka told TechCrunch’s Ron Miller last July that he would take time to understand Infosys’ problems and that he believes software solutions should be about expanding the knowledge and capability of an organization. According to Crunchbase, Panaya has received $59 million in funding. Its last round, a Series E of $20 million, was disclosed in January.Ford and Tencent in talks to build messaging functions for Ford's cars in China: Ford said it was in talks with Tencent, maker of the popular WeChat messaging app, to develop messaging functions for the manufacturer’s cars in China. David Huang, a senior engineer who heads Ford’s Asia Pacific connected-services unit, said, “People want to stay connected, stay informed and stay entertained all the time, even when they’re driving.” Drivers would sync their phone to their car’s software system and control WeChat functions, chosen by Tencent and certified by Ford as safe, through voice commands or limited use of buttons. Yale Zhang, managing director of the Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight, said connectivity was a deciding factor for Chinese customers buying a car. “Those kind of things are the fundamental things people will consider,” he added. Many Chinese use WeChat’s free voice messaging feature instead of phone calls, holding up their smartphones like walkie-talkies as they speak, tap and listen to replies. Rivals including Daimler and Nissan are also looking at ways to give drivers safe, hands-free access to mobile apps in China, home to the world’s largest number of smartphone users. WeChat is China’s most prevalent chatting app, with about half a billion active monthly users.China’s internet restrictions are hurting business, survey finds:  Foreign businesspeople in China are increasingly frustrated by the growing obstacles to wide Internet access, including the onerous system of censorship known as the Great Firewall, according to survey results released this week by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China. The survey was answered by 106 companies that are based in the European Union and have offices in China. Eighty-six percent of the respondents said their businesses had been negatively affected by the blocking of certain websites or tools. That was an increase from 71 percent in last year’s survey. The chamber also asked its members about the greater tightening of Internet access that occurred in China at the end of 2014 and this year. Eighty percent reported a worsening impact on business. Starting in late 2014, the Chinese government cut off access to Gmail from third-party apps, forcing people in China to rely on virtual private network, or V.P.N., software to get to Google’s email service. The regular Gmail site and other Google pages had been blocked consistently since last summer, but people in China had been able to use third-party apps to download Gmail to their devices until December. After blocking Gmail downloads through those apps, forcing more people to turn to VPN software, the government went on to aggressively attack V.P.N.’s. The chamber found that 13 percent of survey respondents had recently deferred investing more in research and development in China, or had been unwilling to set up those operations here, since restrictions grew at the beginning of the year.Russian cybersecurity firm alleges the US embeds super-sophisticated spyware in Iran, Pakistan, Russia and elsewhere: The United States has found a way to permanently embed surveillance and sabotage tools in computers and networks it has targeted in Iran, Russia, Pakistan, China, Afghanistan and other countries closely watched by American intelligence agencies, according to a Russian cybersecurity firm. In a presentation of its findings at a conference in Mexico on Monday, Kaspersky Lab, the Russian firm, said that the implants had been placed by what it called the “Equation Group,” which appears to be a veiled reference to the National Security Agency and its military counterpart, United States Cyber Command. It linked the techniques to those used in Stuxnet, the computer worm that disabled about 1,000 centrifuges in Iran’s nuclear enrichment program. It was later revealed that Stuxnet was part of a program code-named Olympic Games and run jointly by Israel and the United States. Kaspersky’s report said that Olympic Games had similarities to a much broader effort to infect computers well beyond those in Iran. It detected particularly high infection rates in computers in Iran, Pakistan and Russia, three countries whose nuclear programs the United States routinely monitors. Some of the implants burrow so deep into the computer systems, Kaspersky said, that they infect the “firmware,” the embedded software that preps the computer’s hardware before the operating system starts. It is beyond the reach of existing antivirus products and most security controls, Kaspersky reported, making it virtually impossible to wipe out. In many cases, it also allows the American intelligence agencies to grab the encryption keys off a machine, unnoticed, and unlock scrambled contents. Moreover, many of the tools are designed to run on computers that are disconnected from the Internet, which was the case in the computers controlling Iran’s nuclear enrichment plants.Reports that Snapdeal close to raising $400M at valuation of $4.5B - Alibaba apparently not in on the deal: Snapdeal.com, is in talks with new investors, including international hedge funds, to raise $400 million in a fresh round of funding, a person privy to the development told Techcircle.in. This round could see the estimated valuation of Snapdeal increase to $4.5 billion, more than doubling since October. Sources said the rumoured deal between Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and Snapdeal is not on. Snapdeal already counts eBay as a strategic investor in the company. In October last year, Japanese telecom and internet firm SoftBank Corp (which is the single largest shareholder of Alibaba) committed $627 million (Rs 3,846 crore) in Snapdeal. This is the third biggest fundraising round by an Indian e-commerce firm ever, after Flipkart’s record $1 billion funding round early in 2014 which was followed by another $700 million round later during the year. That round also included funding from other existing investors. Snapdeal has raised around $1 billion to date, the bulk of it in 2014 itself.China's two largest taxi apps, backed by Alibaba and Tencent respectively, to merge; post-deal valuation of $6B: Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache, two of China's leading taxi-hailing apps, said on Saturday they would merge to create one of the world's largest smartphone-based transport services. The combined entity would be valued at roughly $6 billion, according to person familiar with the deal. The shareholding structure is unknown. The firms said the two companies, which have not announced a name for the combined entity, would operate independently under separate brands. Didi chief executive Wei Cheng and Kuaidi chief Dexter Chuanwei Lu would become co-chief executives and formally introduce the new business after the Lunar New Year, which begins on Feb. 19, the companies said.  Didi and Kuaidi, backed by Chinese Internet giants Tencent Holdings Ltd and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, respectively, have been locked in a bitter price war for the past year as each seeks to corner the massive Chinese market despite rumors of mounting losses. Didi was estimated to have a roughly 55 percent market share, with Kuaidi claiming nearly all of the rest in a December study by Analysis International.Apple Pay gets a vote-of-confidence from the US government: Apple chief executive Tim Cook announced on Friday a major new merchant for the company's mobile payment solution: the U.S. government. \"Starting in September, Apple Pay will be available for many transactions with the federal government, like for example when you pay for admission to your favorite national park,\" Cook said at a White House organized cybersecurity summit at Stanford University. The company is also working with the government to make procurement cards issued to government employees for expenses compatible with the system, he said. More than 2,000 banks have already signed on with Apple to bring the service to their customers, Cook said, and it is working with the financial industry to deploy the technology to help distribute state and federal benefit programs, including Social Security benefits.The full scope of Cook's announcement was a bit unclear, but a White House fact sheet released in conjunction with the summit said Apple, Visa, MasterCard, Comerica Bank and U.S. Bank were committed to making Apple Pay \"available for users of federal payment cards, including DirectExpress and GSA SmartPay cards.\"  GSA SmartPay is the largest government payment program in the world, according to the General Services Administration — handling 87.4 million transactions worth $26.4 billion per year. That makes this a potentially big deal.Chinese smartphone users consume surprisingly little data - 200MB/month; only about a fourth of the global average: China has about 520 million active smartphone users right now. Unlike in most of Asia’s developing nations, China’s smartphone market is mature and close to its saturation point. Despite all this well-established growth, China’s smartphone users are still using surprisingly little data each month – in fact, they’re using just a quarter of the global average. New numbers from China’s tech ministry, MIIT, shows that mobile users in China now consume an average of 200MB of data each month (as spotted by Reuters). While that figure is going up, it’s still way below the global monthly average of 819MB. China’s mobile data usage has grown slowly from an average of 122.8 MB per month in mid-2013. 200MB is pretty small. It’s the equivalent of downloading or streaming 50 songs or two short TV shows.Xiaomi takes baby steps in the US - where Apple rules, and carrier-sales + phone subsidies blunt cost advantages; also nears manufacturing deal in Brazil: Xiaomi will begin selling headphones, smart wristbands and other accessories online in the United States in coming months, taking its first tentative step onto Apple Inc's home turf without its signature Mi mobile devices. The company also said it is close to securing a manufacturing partner in Brazil, which will help it skirt punishing tariffs on imported electronics when it begins sales in Latin America's largest economy in the first half of this year. Xiaomi, a five-year-old upstart whose name means \"Little Rice,\" came out of nowhere to become China's fastest-selling mobile brand. It has been rapidly expanding its global footprint through direct, online sales. The company was valued at $45 billion in a December funding round that drew investors ranging from Singapore's sovereign wealth fund to a private capital firm backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd co-founder Jack Ma. Its Mi devices, which scored with Chinese users because of their low cost and the company's heavy reliance on user interaction and feedback, are now sold online across Asia, including most recently India. Brazil marks the company's first foray with smartphones outside of its home continent. Global operations vice president Hugo Barra said Xiaomi intends to begin selling its phones there in the first half of this year. The company is in \"extremely advanced discussions\" with at least half a dozen manufacturing partners there, Barra, a former Google Inc executive, said without revealing names, which will help it side-step a roughly 60 percent tax on foreign electronics. The company is eschewing bigger-ticket items like phones and tablets for now partly because of the United States' carrier-sales and phone subsidy structure, which eliminates Xiaomi's cost advantage. More generally, Bin and Barra talked about the time and effort needed to tailor its MIUI Android-based operating systems for individual markets and obtain certification, among other things. Xiaomi's main intention for now is to engage American consumers and try and build a community there the same way it has in China and India - through fan events, interaction with users on social media such as a dedicated Facebook page, and gradually coming to know both local preferences and building its brand. For example, Barra told Reuters how Xiaomi might put its self-branded headphones in front of U.S. audiophiles and tweak the product depending on their detailed feedback.Indian startup action: Housing.com in talks to acquire PropEquity, a real estate data analytics firm:  Housing.com, is in talks to acquire Delhi-based P.E. Analytics Pvt Ltd, which owns a real estate data product PropEquity, sources close to the development told Techcircle.in. According to industry sources, Housing.com is believed to have offered around Rs 80 crore for the company. PropEquity recorded revenues of Rs 13.7 crore in 2014 and losses of Rs 70 lakh. The company has been in losses for the last three years as it had made investments in building a B2C product, according to sources. The deal will give Housing.com a ready revenue stream from B2B clients as the heavily funded company will come under increasing pressure to show revenues. PropEquity’s data and analytics enable clients – mainly real estate private equity investors, developers, and BFSI industry – to spot market trends, and generate macro/micro analytics. It claims of covering over 45,000 projects of 8,200 developers across over 40 cities in India and adding about 500 projects every month. Presently, the company has over 250 employees. On the other hand, Housing.com is a B2C product primarily with tools to sieve through mountains of data to develop indices and metrics that help consumer search for homes. PropEquity is majority owned by entities belonging to American hedge fund Och-Ziff Capital Management Group.A curated introductions startup gains as a way to meet top tech talent in Silicon Valley's red-hot job market: Given the current job market in Silicon Valley, one of the biggest challenges faced by startups and established companies alike is the difficulty in finding and recruiting the best engineers. If you’re a company that’s got a lot of mindshare, you might not have much trouble getting those hot applicants — or you can raise enough to buy smaller teams. But for those without years worth of networking under their belts, finding new engineers can be a real struggle that takes focus away from the task of actually building a product. Enter InterviewJet, which gives employers who sign up a weekly curated introduction to experienced engineers with in-demand skill sets — think Ruby on Rails, Python, and mobile developers. Once the introduction has been made, potential employers have 72 hours to lock down an interview with candidates. InterviewJet co-founder and CEO Joshua Holtzman says the startup has facilitated 1,000 interviews and signed up more than 450 employers to their network since rolling out as a beta in early 2014. With just ten employees, InterviewJet is currently signing up approximately half of the 40-50 companies that apply to join each week and vetting 10-12 new candidates to show off to its member companies. InterviewJet takes a flat fee for every hire it facilitates — $9,500 to be more precise, which Holtzman says often undercuts the finders fee usually paid to headhunters working for top firms. That rate might change in the future based on factors like candidate skill sets or when companies use the service to hire multiple engineers in one pass as an acquisition. That’s happened three times now, including an acqui-hire arranged last summer by Samsung that was facilitated entirely through the service. Since launching its beta version, InterviewJet went through the Talent Tech Labs incubator in New York, which is dedicated to bolstering startups in the talent acquisition space. Post-incubator, the startup has raised $750,000 in seed funding from Mitchell Martin, an IT and healthcare staffing company. Holtzman says that money will go to expanding InterviewJet’s sales and product teams, increasing staff on both by half.Competitors react cautiously to Facebook's moves: Kelly Kramer, Cisco’s chief financial officer, downplayed the risk to Cisco, and pointed to strong sales of its Nexus family of switches in its most recent quarter. She noted that Cisco was also a member of the Open Compute Project, to “better understand where our customers are going.” Juniper is more actively supporting the open approach. In December, it submitted a design for a new switch called the OCX1100 to the Open Compute Project. If accepted, any OCP member could build the machine or write software for it. Arista Networks Inc., a fast-growing supplier specializing in data center switches, is the most threatened by the open approach, given that it gets a high percentage of its sales from a few large cloud providers, according to Jason Noah Ader, an analyst at William Blair & Co.Bangalore lending platform Capital Float, SME lender to Flipkart, Snapdeal sellers, gets $13M in funding: Bangalore-headquartered Zen Lefin Pvt Ltd, the company behind Capital Float, an online platform that provides working capital finance to SMEs (small and medium enterprises) in India, has secured $13 million (Rs 81 crore) in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital with participation of existing investors SAIF Partners and Aspada, it said on Wednesday. The funds will be used for expanding into more cities, improve its tech platform and launch new products. Capital Float works with underserved small businesses via a technology-led loan origination and credit underwriting platform. It provides short-term loans to SMEs that can be used to purchase inventory, service new orders or optimise cash cycles. Borrowers can apply online, select desired repayment terms and receive funds in their bank accounts in seven days. The firm caters to SMEs across a variety of sectors, including manufacturing, services and e-commerce. “We’ve focused on building the platform to deliver flexible and convenient access to finance that can scale with their business (borrowers). By leveraging alternative data in our underwriting model, we are increasingly able to not only make faster decisions but also lend to emerging business models,” said Hinduja and Rishyasringa in a joint statement. To date, the platform claims of having lent nearly Rs 40 crore to SMEs across more than 10 cities in India. Most of the loan applications come from vendors on marketplaces such as Snapdeal, Flipkart, Amazon, PayTM and Myntra.Top tech firms, already sitting on mountains of cash, are borrowing record amounts. Why? Because they can. Microsoft, one of a handful of U.S. companies with top AAA credit ratings, sold a record $10.8 billion of bonds Monday. The 40-year portion of the offering pays an annual interest rate of 4 percent. The Redmond, Washington-based company had $6.4 billion of cash and cash-like securities on its books as of year end. And Apple, which had a whopping $19.5 billion of cash stashed away at the end of December, is back in the bond market for the second time this month. The iPhone creator raised $6.5 billion in an offering last week and is now heading to Switzerland to sell at least 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.1 billion) in its debut offering in that nation.  The party in bonds seems like a win-win for everyone -- for now, at least. Buyers of Microsoft’s $10.8 billion bond sale Monday reaped a $32.7 million reward just in the first few hours after the sale as the debt’s market value climbed. So, what’s the problem? Well, it’s always a little scary when everyone piles into a trade that already seemed crowded. Yields on U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds have fallen to 3.1 percent, compared with 4.7 percent on average over the past decade, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Buying top-rated bonds isn’t a guaranteed payday either. These notes are more sensitive to moves in benchmark government yields, a potential liability as the Federal Reserve debates raising interest rates this year. Why should having billions of dollars in cash stop you from borrowing more? That appears to be the logic at top-rated companies like Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. They’re selling bonds at an accelerating clip, locking in cheap interest rates for as long as 40 years. “The cost of capital that you’re paying is so obscenely low that there’s no reason not to” borrow, said Jody Lurie, a corporate credit analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. Corporate treasurers are wondering: “When is this wonderful market situation for these higher-rated credits going to end?”Several of the best-funded startups in Singapore are struggling; rocket startup Lazada is the one unicorn on the list:  1. Lazada, US$686 million: The fashion ecommerce retailer is one of Rocket Internet’s greatest successes so far, and is the only unicorn on this list with a valuation of US$1.25 billion. Thanks to its recent shift to a marketplace model for third-party merchants, Lazada’s sales – or gross merchandise volume (GMV) – doubled in the second half of 2014 as compared to the former half, bringing its total GMV for that year to roughly US$274.2 million. 2. Zalora, US$238 million: The other Rocket Internet-backed startup on the list, Zalora’s last-seen numbers aren’t exactly rosy. According to leaked documents, it had a net negative income of US$91 million in 2012, expecting to reach profitability by 2015.  3. iCarsClub, US$70.5 million: A peer-to-peer car rental platform is a great idea in Singapore, given the high costs of car ownership here. Nailing the execution, however, is a whole different ballgame, and iCarsClub has received some negative publicity in 2014 regarding just that. Still, having a war chest at its disposal will certainly help if it is directed in the right direction. iCarsClub and its Beijing-based spinoff PPzuche now have over 120,000 private cars available in their databases. 4. PropertyGuru, US$53 million: Online property classifieds are a hotly-contested industry in Southeast Asia, but somehow PropertyGuru have managed to stay ahead of the pack. In Singapore, 99.co is the latest challenger. CEO Steve Melhuish had revealed a couple of years ago that the company might go public, but nothing has happened since then. 5. Reebonz, US$40 million, 6. Bubbly, US$39 million, 7. MyRepublic, US$37.5 million, 8. Migme, US$34.6 million , 9. Wego, US$34.5 million, 10. Viki, US$24.3 million [Indian startup action] StoreKing, an e-com enabler for offline stores in small towns gets funding from Mangrove Capital: Mangrove Capital Partners, a Luxembourg-based venture capital firm which has backed Skype and Nimbuzz, has invested in LocalCube Commerce Pvt Ltd, an e-com enabler for offline stores in small towns under the brand StoreKing, as per its website. Although the investment amount stands undisclosed, the VC firm typically puts in $5-10 million in a company initially. It is learnt that the transaction was completed a few weeks ago. We have contacted Sridhar Gundaiah, founder of LocalCube, and will update the post as and when we hear from him. StoreKing is essentially an enabler for offline stores to expand their reach. It installs digital kiosks with screens at stores in small towns providing a self-service shopping experience to consumers. It claims it is present in over 600 stores in 22 districts of Karnataka and covers over 190 towns in the state According to its site, its kiosk-enabled stores sees over 50,000 walk-ins everyday and over 200,000 people have registered on its platform and it has sold over 30,000 SKUs to date. The Bangalore-based startup was founded in 2011 by Gundaiah, a computer science engineer who was previously with online travel agency Via.com. He had also founded a location based startup Yulop and in the past worked at Yellow Tag and EDS. Meanwhile, Mangrove Capital’s partner Michael Jackson told The Economic Times that the VC firm has earmarked a corpus of $200-250 million to invest in India’s e-commerce, internet and telecom startups. It has an investment horizon of 5-10 years.The package delivery start-up space is getting increasingly crowded in the US: Sidecar, a Ride-Hailing Start-Up, Pushes Into Package Delivery Start-ups like Uber and Lyft are making it acceptable to carpool with total strangers. In the future, you may start carpooling with their lunch. That is exactly what Sidecar, a ride-hailing start-up in competition with the likes of Uber and Lyft, aims to make happen. The company announced on Monday it plans to use its fleet of cars to introduce a package delivery service, delivering items like food and groceries for partner companies. That service will be powered by Sidecar drivers who are also picking up and dropping off passengers, a move the company says cuts pricing and delivery times dramatically. The new service, which is now available in all of the American cities in which Sidecar operates, is essentially an open call to restaurants, grocers and stores which do not otherwise offer a delivery service. Sidecar, which is based in San Francisco, will face numerous competitors. GrubHub, the big online food-ordering service, recently acquired DiningIn and Restaurants on the Run, two companies that will allow GrubHub to start offering delivery for the restaurants it serves. Postmates, another start-up, owns a fleet of messengers who order and pick up food from thousands of restaurants. Sidecar will rub up against Uber, too, in its ultimate ambitions of becoming a way to delivery anything — from groceries to gourmet food — anytime, anywhere to anyone. And to some degree, Sidecar’s move into deliver will also pit it against a couple of the tech titans, Amazon and Google, which have both dabbled in same-day delivery projects.Patent story #2 of the day: Microsoft and Samsung have settled a contract dispute over patent royalties, though terms of the settlement are confidential, Microsoft said in a statement on Monday. Microsoft sued Samsung last year in a federal court in New York, accusing Samsung of breaching a collaboration agreement by initially refusing to make royalty payments after the U.S. company announced its intention to acquire Nokia's handset business in September 2013. The lawsuit claimed Samsung still owed $6.9 million in interest on more than $1 billion in patent royalties it delayed paying. Samsung has countered that the Nokia acquisition violated its 2011 collaboration deal with Microsoft. In 2011 a technology analyst at Citigroup estimated that Microsoft was getting $5 per Android handset sold by phone maker HTC under a patent agreement, and that Microsoft was looking for up to $12.50 per phone from other handset makers it had yet to come to an agreement with. Microsoft has never confirmed those figures, but neither has it said publicly that the estimates were out of line. To apply the $5 price to Samsung, the Korean company could be paying Microsoft about $1.6 billion per year, based on Samsung's sales of 318 million smartphones in 2014, according to IDC shipment numbers. Samsung said it had agreed in 2011 to pay Microsoft royalties in exchange for a patent license covering phones that ran Google Inc's Android operating system. Samsung also agreed to develop Windows phones and share confidential business information with Microsoft, according to court filings. Once Microsoft acquired Nokia, it became a direct hardware competitor with Samsung, the filings said, and Samsung refused to share some sensitive information because of antitrust concerns.Patent story #3 of the day: IBM filed a lawsuit against Priceline on Monday, accusing it of infringing four IBM patents in running its travel and dining websites. International Business Machines Corp asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware to bar Priceline from using the patents, to award IBM royalties and to order Priceline to pay IBM's costs and attorney's fees. IBM also said that the infringement was willful, and asked for all damages to be trebled. IBM said it had approached Priceline about the alleged infringement. \"Despite IBM’s repeated demands, Priceline refuses to negotiate a license. This lawsuit seeks to stop Priceline from continuing to use IBM’s intellectual property without authorization,\" IBM said in its complaint. Two of the IBM patents are from the late 1990s, one which tracks prior conversations with a user and another which speeds Internet transmissions. The third patent is from 2006 and is a method of showing Internet advertising; a fourth from 2009 improves on a single sign-on. Priceline also used the patented technology on its websites kayak.com and opentable.com, IBM alleged...Against that backdrop, Alibaba will buy a minority stake in little-known domestic smartphone maker Meizu Technology Co for $590 million, as the e-commerce giant extends its hardware growth strategy into mobile devices. Alibaba, now worth $213 billion by market value, didn't disclose how big its holding will be in a privately owned handset maker that is a distant rival to much bigger smartphone firms like Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL]. Based in Zhuhai, Guangdong, Meizu employs more than 1,000 people, according to its website. The deal will help Alibaba push its mobile operating system within China through Meizu's handsets, while giving Meizu access to Alibaba's e-commerce sales channels and other resources, the companies said in a joint statement. Alibaba has in the past concentrated on software and services, including its core e-commerce business. Now, in a move reminiscent of U.S. rival Amazon.com Inc's own foray into smartphones with the Fire Phone, the Meizu investment builds on Alibaba's more recent efforts to develop in hardware, like internet TV via set-top boxes. \"The investment in Meizu represents...an important step in our overall mobile strategy as we strive to bring users a wider array of mobile offerings and experiences,\" said Wang Jian, Alibaba's chief technology officer, in Monday's statement. China is the world's largest smartphone market, with 557 million people accessing the internet via mobile devices, according to government data. But smartphone sales are flagging. Shipments in China were 389 million phones in 2014, down from 423 million the previous year, according to China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Meizu also doesn't feature among China's top smartphone brands. The top four in the fourth quarter of 2014 were Apple Inc, Xiaomi, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], according to data research firm Canalys.The move is seen as Alibaba's effort to kickstart its struggling mobile phone division: Alibaba is stumping up more than half a billion dollars to kick its lacklustre mobile phone business into gear. The NYSE-listed e-commerce giant today announced a $590 million investment in Chinese phone-maker Meizu. The deal grants Alibaba an undisclosed “minority” share in the Guangdong-based company, which sold 1.5 million of its Android-based smartphones in January, but it is particularly notable for the strategic alliance between the two. Meizu, which operates a Xiaomi-like online sales model but is yet to break into China’s top five smartphone companies based on sales, will integrate its hardware with Alibaba’s struggling operating system. Aliyun, which is based around Android, is used for smartphones and smart TV sets. The move is an interesting one when you consider that Xiaomi, the smartphone success story of 2014, is rapidly moving into e-commerce after starting out in mobile hardware and software.India's efforts to attract electronics manufacturing are finally gaining some traction: General Electric Co. and Nidec Corp. are among companies looking to take advantage of a subsidy India is offering for electronics manufacturing amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s push to boost economic growth. The government has received at least 60 applications, with about half of them approved, for a subsidy of as much as 25 percent on capital investment, Ajay Kumar, joint secretary in the Department of Electronics & Information Technology, said in an interview in New Delhi. More than 40 submissions were made after Modi took office in May, he said. “The subsidy is a very good investment scheme that existed before Modi, but it wasn’t marketed very well,” Sunil Kumar, compliance officer at Nidec’s Indian unit, said by phone. “The government machinery is functioning better than before.” India introduced incentives in July 2012 for new projects and for expansion in electronics manufacturing in industries such as telecommunications, automobiles, medical and semiconductors. It started accepting applications for subsidies from August 2013, said Kumar at the Department of Electronics. “Suddenly with the emphasis on Digital India, electronics makers know there’ll be more demand for their products,” said Kumar. “Now, practically on a weekly basis applications come in.” Jabil Circuit Inc., the maker of electronics for Apple Inc. that got approval for its investment proposal in June, plans to double its revenue from a factory in the western city of Pune making products including television set-top boxes, Sunil Naik, operations manager at the India unit, said by phone. The St. Petersburg, Florida-based company, which plans to invest as much as $20 million, has already spent $6 million.Rocket's Foodpanda.com has bought Indian rival Just Eat India, financials not disclosed: Foodpanda.com, a Rocket Internet-backed global, multi-location online food ordering marketplace (which operates under Hellofood brand in some markets) has acquired its Indian rival Just Eat India. The transaction details are not disclosed. Founded in April 2012, Foodpanda features location-specific listing of restaurants on its site. Users can check out menus, along with special offers, post that they can order and get food delivered to their homes. One can also search for restaurants according to cuisine, and/or by other parameters such as vegetarian/non-veg, healthy food, etc. The company helps restaurants increase sales through online and mobile platforms and also provides them with technology and analytics. Last year, the firm had raised $20 million in funding from Phenomen Ventures, a Russia-based venture capital firm and a group of unnamed investors. Globally, the company is present in over 40 countries in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Just Eat Plc was launched in Denmark in 2001 and was traded publicly on the London Stock Exchange. The company’s Indian business was launched as ‘Hungry Bangalore’ back in 2006, but was renamed (in 2011) when Just Eat acquired a majority stake in the business. In this space, Mumbai-based hybrid startup incubation platform Antfarm Business Incubator Pvt Ltd (Ant Farm) had acquired city-based food delivery venture Meals on Wheels, run by Meal O Wheel Pvt Ltd, in a stock-and-cash deal worth Rs 11-15 crore ($1.7-2.4 million) in November 2014.Indian startup action: Alipay comes to India: investment in One97 confirmed; will acquire 25% stake - financials not disclosed: (more coverage here) Ant Financial, the affiliate group of Alibaba that oversees its third-party payment service Alipay, has invested in India’s One97, the parent company of third-party payment service Paytm, Bloomberg reports. The size of the investment has not been disclosed, but Ant Financial will take a 25 percent stake in the New Delhi-based firm. Rumors of the investment had been circulating for weeks, with the Wall Street Journal and others reporting the round was worth US$575 million. Paytm is a payment processor built specifically for India’s mobile shoppers. The Reserve Bank of India places tough restrictions on companies looking to receive a PPI license (prepaid payment instrument) license, so Paytm’s permission, coupled with its two-tap checkout procedure, have helped it gain strong traction domestically. When Tech in Asia profiled the company in October 2014, founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma claimed that Paytm was processing 600,000 orders every day, and 5 million orders on mobile every month. Ant Financial Services Group, China’s leading online financial services company that owns AliPay, is all set to acquire 25 per cent stake in Noida-headquartered mobile internet firm One97 Communications Ltd. The financials of the deal are not disclosed. Ant Financial, an affiliate of China’s Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, will provide One97’s m-com and virtual wallet property Paytm with strategic and technical support for its business, following the deal. The companies will also build on synergies in the mobile wallet front. This deal also marks Ant Financial’s entry into the Indian market. Last month, Techcircle.in had reported that One97 is raising $575 million from the world’s largest e-com firm Alibaba and the group’s separate payment unit Alipay. This was in addition to $60 million more from existing lead investor SAIF Partners. One97 had zeroed in on Alibaba Group as the new investor after negotiating with various possible suitors including Singapore’s state-owned investment firm Temasek among others. It had signed a term-sheet for investment with Temasek as first reported by Techcircle.in but decided to go ahead with a deal with Alibaba. Founded in 2000, One97 Communications is a leading mobile-internet company in India that offers digital goods & services to its mobile consumers under the Paytm brand. It also provides mobile advertising, marketing and payments for merchants. In addition, it has a partnership with existing lead investor SAIF Partners where it invests in early stage mobile internet startups through One97 Mobility Fund.Indian startup action: India’s FreeCharge, Which Gives Users Coupons When They Pay Bills, Raises $80M Series C: FreeCharge, an India-based mobile commerce platform that gives users coupons and other rewards when they pay their phone, satellite television, and utility bills, has raised an $80 million series C. The round included new investors Valiant Capital Management and Tybourne Capital Management, as well as returning investors Sequoia Capital, RuNet, and Sofina. TechCrunch last covered FreeCharge in September, when it raised a $33 million Series B. Its latest funding brings FreeCharge’s total raised so far to about $115 million. The company says it now has a customer base of more than 20 million. Its mobile app was downloaded 10 million times last year. Customers use FreeCharge by logging onto its website or mobile apps to top up their prepaid mobile phone plans or pay TV and utility bills. FreeCharge then emails them coupons which can be redeemed at leading e-commerce sites like Flipkart and Amazon India or in brick-and-mortar retailers such as McDonalds, Baskin Robbins, and coffee shops. For participating vendors, FreeCharge offers insight into consumer behavior by tracking which coupons are redeemed and what products or services they are used for. In addition to providing coupons, FreeCharge eventually plans to expand into transaction advertising. It is eyeing growth in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and AfricaMajor hacker attack on US insurance giant Anthem - motives unclear, but fears of Chinese state-sponsored group involvement:: A hack at Anthem, the second-largest health insurer in the country, exposed personal information about millions of employees and customers. But the attack is just the latest evidence that cybercriminals are increasingly targeting the medical sector where they can collect health information that can be sold for a premium on the black market. \"What we've seen in the last few years is that attackers have realized the economics of health-care data are very, very attractive,\" says Lee Weiner, senior vice president at cybersecurity firm Rapid7. Anthem said hackers collected several pieces of personal information about its employees and customers, including Social Security numbers, birthdays and street and e-mail addresses. But the hack also included medical information numbers, which can be among the most damaging types of stolen data and be used to commit medical fraud, according to security experts. Complete health insurance credentials sold for $20 a piece on underground markets in 2013, according to Dell SecureWorks. That is 10 to 20 times more than a U.S. credit card number with a security code. Fears of Chinese state-sponsored group involvement: Investigators of Anthem Inc.’s data breach are pursuing evidence that points to Chinese state-sponsored hackers who are stealing personal information from health-care companies for purposes other than pure profit, according to three people familiar with the probe. The breach, which exposed Social Security numbers and other sensitive details of 80 million customers, is one of the biggest thefts of medical-related customer data in U.S. history.  The attack appears to follow a pattern of thefts of medical data by foreigners seeking a pathway into the personal lives and computers of a select group -- defense contractors, government workers and others, according to a U.S. government official familiar with a more than year-long investigation into the evidence of a broader campaign. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is leading the investigation, according to Anthem, which has hired FireEye Inc., a Milpitas, California-based security company, to assist. China has said in the past that it doesn’t conduct espionage through hacking. The Chinese embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Hackers could use stolen information -- which Anthem said in its case included birthdates and e-mail addresses -- to conduct “phishing” attacks on customers who unwittingly provide access to their companies’ networks. Government officials have been investigating whether foreign interests are using personal, financial or medical information as leverage to gain intelligence from people who want their information to stay private, according to the U.S. official.Leaking can be risky: SEC investigates options trades on Blackberry-Samsung rumors: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating a January 14 spike in trading in BlackBerry Ltd options that took place hours before Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co was in talks to buy the Canadian smartphone maker, according to a person familiar with the investigation. One trade the SEC is looking at took place at 12:06 p.m. on that day, when there was a purchase of options with the rights to buy 200,000 shares of BlackBerry stock at a strike price of $10 a share, the person said. Later that afternoon, Reuters reported that Samsung had offered to buy BlackBerry for as much as $7.5 billion, valuing its stock at between $13.35 to $15.49 per share, a 38 percent to 60 percent premium over BlackBerry’s trading price at the time. BlackBerry’s stock, which closed on Jan. 13 at $9.71, shot up 30% on the news to close at $12.60 on Jan. 14, its biggest one-day gain in years. The call options, which expired on January 23, were purchased for 10 cents in the trade. They surged on the Reuters story to a high of $2.55. If the buyer had been able to sell the options at that high they would have been able to make a profit of $490,000 on a $20,000 investment. It is unclear, though, whether the buyer was able to sell the options at a profit. The SEC is investigating whether a source of information provided to Reuters bought Blackberry options, according to the person familiar with the investigation. Both companies later denied they were in talks and BlackBerry’s shares tumbled. Reuters subsequently corrected its story to make clear that the discussions were between advisors rather than company officials. There is no indication that Reuters is a target of the investigation. A spokeswoman for Thomson Reuters declined to comment.A sad day: RadioShack has officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Once a home base to the radio/homebrew/DIY geeks of the world, RadioShack devolved into a glorified cell phone store in the early 2000s. While they’ve spent the last few years trying to find their roots with things like a dedicated section for Arduino gear*, they’ve mostly failed to get bodies back in the store.South Korea is showing real intent in taking on Uber: South Korea on Thursday rejected online ride-sharing firm Uber Technologies Inc's proposal for a new driver registration system, and vowed to shut down the U.S. company's operations. Uber on Wednesday proposed a registration system to allow its drivers to operate legally in Asia's fourth-largest economy, where CEO Travis Kalanick and the head of the company's South Korean unit have been indicted for violating licensing rules. But the transport ministry said a parallel taxi registration system was unacceptable in a market already over-supplied with taxis. \"Transporting customers with private or rented cars and accepting compensation is clearly illegal. The company is ignoring local laws by stating its intention to continue such operations,\" the ministry said in a statement. It said it would continue to curtail Uber's activities and work with legislators to ban the service. In January, the city of Seoul started offering rewards of up to 1 million won ($929) for people who reported private or rented car drivers providing transport through Uber.Temasek invests $60M in analytics firm Manthan; Mu Sigma is reportedly in talks to raise $200M: Singapore’s state owned investment firm Temasek has led a $60 million (Rs 370 crore) investment round in Bangalore-based Manthan Software Services Pvt Ltd, a provider of business intelligence and Big Data analytics solutions for enterprises. Existing investor Norwest Venture Partners also participated, according to a top executive of the company. The investment includes both a primary issue where Manthan gets fresh financial resource as well as a secondary component where one of the three existing investors IDG Ventures has exited from the company. Another existing investor Fidelity has partially exited. The quantum of money going into the firm could not be immediately ascertained but a Mint report said the firm received Rs 105 crore as part of the investment round a few weeks ago. With headquarters in Bangalore, the firm also has offices in the US, the UK, the Philippines, Singapore and Brazil. In the space, Bangalore-based pure-play analytics provider Fractal Analytics raised an undisclosed amount in funding from Canadian loyalty management firm Aimia. India- and US-based Mu Sigma Inc., one of the leading Big Data analytics companies in the world, is in talks with a group of investors to raise upwards of $200 million in fresh funding.Consolidation: Rumors swirl that Uber is looking to buy Meru and Olacabs is looking to buy TaxiForSure: Uber now reportedly in talks to buy Meru while Olacabs is said to be eyeing TaxiForSure. For all we know these could be just rumours possibly meant to scupper independent fundraising plans of the individual ventures. Both Meru and Uber have denied the reports calling it untrue. Meru, a legacy radio cab firm  owns several thousands of cars. However, the business model can be easily pivoted by leasing out the cars to fleet ownership and management firms. What’s more, it could hive off the car assets into another company which could be sold off to another firm thus separating the cars from Meru’s balance sheet. This is exactly what Flipkart did when it separated the legal ownership of WS Retail, its single largest vendor. That would make Meru a marketplace like its other fast growing peers. Last year Meru’s chief Sidharth Pahwa told us that around 60 per cent of the cars are not owned by the firm and that figure could well have got bumped up further.Alibaba ties up with online marketplace lending giant to bring unsecured loans to American businesses looking to order from Alibaba: The companies behind two of the hottest stock market debuts of 2014, Lending Club and the Alibaba Group, are teaming up — to help American companies buy parts from Chinese manufacturers. The two announced on Tuesday that they would form a partnership to provide financing for manufacturers in the United States to buy products and supplies through the Chinese marketplace Alibaba.com. Through Lending Club, the giant of the online marketplace lending industry, those companies can line up from $5,000 to as much as $300,000 for each purchase order. It’s an unusual move meant in part to replace traditional business supply-chain borrowing, at least for the small- to medium-size businesses that look to Alibaba for a portion of their manufacturing. Rather than have to rely on banks or other traditional lenders who require collateral for their financing, these customers can instead use Lending Club’s systems to procure an unsecured loan with near-instant approval. it is a unifying of two of the most talked-about online marketplaces of the moment. Alibaba is one of China’s biggest Internet companies, whose multiple platforms — including Alibaba.com, which is meant for wholesale purchases — draw millions of customers. And Lending Club helped define what once was known as peer-to-peer lending, in which potential investors can go online to be matched with hopeful borrowers. The loans for the new venture, to be called “Alibaba.com e-Credit Line, Powered by Lending Club,” comes at lower interest rates than what others can provide. According to Mr. Laplanche, the new venture offers a monthly interest rate starting at 0.5 percent, about half of what a more traditional lender could provide. But unlike more traditional manufacturing financing options, such as “factoring,” the loans aren’t backed by particular assets. Alibaba had begun searching for a lending partner several months ago, eventually reaching out to both traditional banks and newer market-based lenders. After what amounted to a lengthy audition process, including trips to Alibaba’s offices in China, the Chinese e-commerce giant ultimately chose to go with Lending Club. “First of all, they are also a platform business,” Michael Lee, Alibaba.com’s global marketing and business development director, said in a telephone interview, adding that customers had asked for an simple financing solution for some time. “They are also very transparent with their rate and the way they do business. And they got good feedback from their own users.” For Alibaba, according to Mr. Lee, the hope is that customers will use such financing to make orders at least once a year. And if the system proves as easy to use as both sides hope, it could help convince more American businesses to order from Alibaba.com more often. For Lending Club, the move is meant to help further a move into new kinds of lending. Though it began life by offering debt consolidation loans to help pay off credit cards, the company has pushed to enter new kinds of financing, including elective surgical procedures and small-business loans.Alan Eustace, SVP of Knowledge, is leaving Google: Alan Eustace, a longtime Google employee and its SVP of Knowledge — and also the current world-record holder for making the highest-altitude free-fall jump — is leaving the company. Eustace is not departing for another role elsewhere but is retiring, from what we understand. The news was conveyed to staff by internal memo, and it’s not clear who will be taking over his role and/or if there are any other departures. We’ve been told by a source that Google has been working through a larger reorganization of its business. Eustace had been looking to leave for a while and seized the moment. Things have been moving around at the executive level of Google in the last several months. In October last year (literally the same day Eustace set his skydiving record), several divisions of the company were centralised under Sundar Pichai, including Eustace’s research operations. Shortly after that, Android pioneer Andy Rubin left the company. Other research leaders who have left Google include Sebastian Thrun, who helped found Google X to develop “moonshot” products and technology. He stepped away from his VP and Fellow roles at the company last September to focus more on his education startup Udacity. Google is a company in transition, with the company’s widened focus today on areas like mobile, video, driverless cars, cloud-based services like maps and other apps, and connected home products, expanding its reach it well beyond the search business that was its main operation when Eustace joined in 2002.Tencent blocked key Alibaba apps ahead of the Spring Festival Holiday: As China’s massive Spring Festival holiday approaches, the folks at Tencent WeChat have been busy pressing the delete key on links between their app and a number of Alibaba services. First, Sina Tech reported that WeChat had shut down a sharing like with Alibaba’s Alipay that allowed Alipay users to send digital Spring Festival red envelopes of money to WeChat friends. Now, it appears WeChat has also shut down sharing connections with Alibaba music apps Xiami and Tiantian Dongting, meaning users can no longer share content from those apps directly with their WeChat friends. The Alipay closure is less of a surprise, as the two companies have been slugging it out over red envelopes for a couple of years now. WeChat has its own red-envelope-sending service, so stopping Alipay users from sending money easily to their WeChat friends makes some sense. If WeChat users can’t send money through Alipay, they might just send it through WeChat’s built-in service. That way Tencent, rather than Alibaba, earns money from the transaction. And with the Spring Festival holiday fast approaching, red envelope transactions will soon reach their yearlong high. It’s less clear why WeChat has closed its sharing connections with Alibaba music apps Xiami and Tiantian Dongting. No app-specific reason is apparent, but Tencent and Alibaba have been rivals for some time. Now it seems Tencent is declaring all-out war on Alibaba, and shutting down the connections between Alibaba’s apps and its own uber-popular social platform.Even-steven: Apple will spend $2B on a data center in Arizona, even as AT&T sells data center assets worth $2B: On Monday, Arizona announced that Apple would invest $2 billion in the creation of a data center at a facility in Mesa after its original plans to produce sapphire, a material tougher than glass, there were abandoned. Apple had contracted GT Advanced Technologies, a sapphire producer, to make sapphire screens for iPhones, among other things. But to Apple’s surprise, GTAT declared bankruptcy last October after failing to meet some of Apple’s demands. As a result, Apple released it latest iPhones without sapphire. While Apple may have abandoned sapphire production at the Arizona facility, the company has not given up on the facility itself, which measures 1.3 million square feet. Apple on Monday said that the multibillion-dollar investment in the data center was one of its most significant investments ever, creating 600 engineering and construction jobs. The center will be partly used as a central command center for monitoring Apple’s other data centers around the world, the company said. AT&T Inc is selling some data centers worth about $2 billion as it continues its streak of asset sales, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. AT&T, the No. 2 U.S wireless provider, has been exploring options to pay down its debt and raise funds for investments in recent months. The company declined to comment. The three sources requested anonymity because the matter is not public. AT&T and its rival Verizon have been selling non-core assets in recent months. Verizon is close to announcing divestitures of wireless towers and wireline markets worth $10 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. AT&T hired a financial adviser to assist in the sale. Following spectrum investments and pending acquisitions, AT&T's debt ratio may rise in the near term, the company said last week after spending close to half of the total bids in the record-setting $44.9 billion spectrum sale that concluded last week. AT&T emerged the top bidder in the AWS-3 spectrum auction by bagging 251 licenses worth $18.2 billion...even as Netflix plans to raise $1B in borrowing despite a ratings downgrade: Netflix today said it plans to offer $1 billion in senior notes and plans to use the proceeds for “general corporate purposes, which may include content acquisitions, capital expenditures, investments, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic transactions.” Markets are not entirely thrilled with the move. Netflix’s stock is trading down slightly, and S&P has downgraded the company’s debt rating to B+ from BB-. S&P notes that Netflix already has $9.5 billion streaming content commitment as of December 31, 2014, up from $7.3 billion a year earlier. “We expect that streaming content commitments will continue to increase and that Netflix’s pursuit of more original programming with global rights will increase its cash flow deficits,” it concludes.Google maybe getting ready to launch a competitor to Uber: Google Ventures, the search giant's venture capital arm, invested $258 million in Uber in August 2013. It was Google Ventures' largest investment deal ever, and the company put more money into Uber's next funding round less than a year later. Back then, it was easy for observers to imagine Google teaming closely with Uber, or even one day acquiring it. David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer and senior vice president of corporate development, joined the Uber board of directors in 2013 and has served on it ever since. Now there are signs that the companies are more likely to be ferocious competitors than allies. Google is preparing to offer its own ride-hailing service, most likely in conjunction with its long-in-development driverless car project. Drummond has informed Uber's board of this possibility, according to a person close to the Uber board, and Uber executives have seen screenshots of what appears to be a Google ride-sharing app that is currently being used by Google employees. This person, who requested not to be named because the talks are private, said the Uber board is now weighing whether to ask Drummond to resign his position as an Uber board member. have left executives at Uber deeply concerned—for good reason. Google is a deep-pocketed, technically sophisticated competitor, and Uber’s dependence on the search giant goes far beyond capital. Uber’s smartphone applications for drivers and riders are based on Google Maps, which gives Google a fire hose of data about transportation patterns within cities. Uber would be crippled if it lost access to the industry-leading mapping application, and alternatives— such as AOL's MapQuest, Apple Maps, and a host of regional players—are widely seen as inferior. Google’s entrance into the ride-sharing market would also leave Uber without a partner in the suddenly plausible future in which cars without steering wheels roam the streets. Uber will either have to develop the technology itself or form an alliance with a company that can if it wants to offer autonomous vehicles within its fleet. Mercedes, Audi, Tesla, and other carmakers have said they are developing driverless cars, though it's not clear that any is as advanced as Google's. Chinese agency softens criticism of Alibaba on sales of fake goods: It was only two days ago that a Chinese government regulator chastised the Alibaba Group, the e-commerce giant, for failing to curb the sale of fake goods on its sites. Now the two appear to have made up in a hurry. The regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said on Friday that its leader, Zhang Mao, had met with Alibaba’s executive chairman, Jack Ma, to discuss cooperating to fight counterfeiting and protect consumers. The agency made its criticism of Alibaba in a report released on Wednesday. But it is now backing away from the findings of that report, calling it a recounting of a July meeting between the two sides and not an official document with legal weight. It is a surprisingly quick turn of events for both Alibaba and the Chinese agency, given the public criticism that the S.A.I.C. delivered to one of its country’s most important Internet players. The S.A.I.C.’s blunt tone disappeared in the Friday statement. The agency described Alibaba as “steadfast and resolute” in fighting the sale of counterfeit goods, though it maintained that e-commerce platforms in China still needed to improve their self-policing. Both sides pledged to work more closely on matters like creating new regulatory mechanisms. “Both sides believe that the regulators and online platforms share the common interest to promote the healthy development of the online commerce industry and creating an online shopping environment where consumers feel safe and satisfied,” the regulator said, according to an English-language translation of its statement. In a post on its corporate blog, Alibaba said it planned to hire 300 people to form an anticounterfeiting task force to bolster its policing staff. A representative for Alibaba said in a statement: “The most recent S.A.I.C. posting speaks for itself. We feel vindicated.”Some of the damage might be lasting though - Alibaba stock is down 15% in a week, and class action lawsuits in the US might follow non-disclosure of SAIC meeting before IPO: Alibaba's representatives discussed the SAIC's claims in meetings with the agency's Internet regulation director, Liu Hongliang, in July—about two months before its record-breaking New York Stock Exchange debut. Did Alibaba need to disclose this information before going public? Following the plunge in Alibaba's stock price, which has dropped almost 14 percent since Monday, the class action lawyers are taking aim at the company. Pomerantz, a firm that says it fights \"for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct,\" announced yesterday an investigation for Alibaba investors. Rosen Law Firm is investigating allegations the company \"may have issued materially misleading information to the investing public,\" the New York-based firm announced yesterday. The firm \"is preparing a class action lawsuit to recover losses suffered by [Alibaba] shareholders.\" Several other law firms have said they're investigating, too. Responding to the law firms' announcements, Alibaba said today in a statement to Bloomberg that it is a company \"with strong values\" that \"will vigorously defend the truth and our reputation.\"Verizon finally to allow complete opt-out of mobile ‘Supercookies’: (more coverage here)Verizon Wireless, which has been under fire by privacy advocates since late last year, has decided to make a major revision to its mobile ad-targeting program. Users who do not want to be tracked with an identifier that Verizon uses for ad-targeting purposes will soon be able to completely opt out, the company said on Friday. In the past, Verizon allowed users to opt out of the marketing side of the program, but they had no option to disable being tagged with its undeletable customer codes, which critics dubbed “supercookies.” Some security researchers quickly illustrated that third parties, like advertisers, could easily exploit Verizon’s persistent tracking to continually follow a user’s web browsing activities. In a recent interview, Praveen Atreya, a Verizon director who helped develop the technology behind the mobile marketing program, said the company was considering allowing its subscribers to opt out of being tagged with its undeletable customer codes. On Friday, Verizon confirmed this decision. But even if Verizon now allows subscribers to opt-out of having their online activities tracked using a unique customer code, that option may not satisfy privacy advocates who say consumers are unlikely to understand the implications of default tracking. Some say Verizon should have the feature turned off by default and require people to voluntarily switch it on. But whether Verizon ultimately gives its subscribers the choice to opt out or opt in, cyber-security experts say Verizon will still have to grapple with a basic issue: how to prevent third parties from hijacking its unique customer codes for their own purposes?Spotify seeks to raise $500M at $6-7B valuation, delay IPO: Spotify, the popular streaming music service, has retained Goldman Sachs to raise $500 million in private investment, a move that would probably delay the possibility of an initial public stock offering in the near future.As a result of this latest round of investment, Spotify’s valuation would increase to at least $6 billion, and possibly $7 billion or more, according to a person briefed on the company’s plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In its last fund-raising round, in late 2013, it took in $250 million and was valued at more than $4 billion. Spotify says it now has 60 million users around the world, 15 million of whom pay. On Wednesday, it scored a coup in the digital music market when Sony said it would soon shut Music Unlimited, its failed streaming outlet, and replace it with Spotify.Google CFO sounds unconcerned at prospect of browsers replacing Google as default search engine: Patrick Pichette, Google's chief financial officer, says people can change. On Thursday's earnings call, he suggested that people will seek out Google's search engine even if their browsers default to a different one. \"If they love Google, they'll continue to find Google, whichever platform, whichever browser,\" Pichette said on the call. \"The way to win in this in the long term is very simple. You just make wonderful products. And when you make wonderful products that are magical, people will find them.\" That's some magical thinking, but it's probably wrong. In November, Mozilla switched to Yahoo! as the default search engine on Firefox in the U.S. The next month, Google's share of the U.S. search market sank 4 percentage points, the biggest drop since 2009, according to analytics firm StatCounter. That month, Yahoo increased its share by 3 percentage points. Pichette declined to comment on the Mozilla deal. Google isn't in danger of losing its money-printing machine to Marissa Mayer any time soon. Even after that victory last month, the Yahoo chief executive officer has amassed just 10.4 percent of the U.S. search market. Google has 75.2 percent of it—and even more in Europe. There's only so much impact Firefox can have. The once-dominant browser has been left hanging onto about 12 percent of U.S. users, according to StatCounter. And there's still a chance that some Firefox faithful will switch their settings back to Google. The real reason Google investors are biting their nails over the Firefox deal is because Apple could do the same thing. Apple makes a lot of money from Google searches made through its Safari Web browser on the iPhone and iPad. But it's no secret that relations between the two companies are about as deflated as Tom Brady's footballs. Besides dropping Google Maps and YouTube from home screens, Apple went with Microsoft's Bing to power Siri's new search features. Microsoft knows better than anyone that default software settings stick. A few years back, Microsoft researchers discovered that less than 5 percent of users touch any application settings at all. China is cracking down on long-tolerated VPN workarounds, making internet censorship even more pervasive: China has long had some of the world’s most onerous Internet restrictions. But until now, the authorities had effectively tolerated the proliferation of V.P.N.s as a lifeline for millions of people, from archaeologists to foreign investors, who rely heavily on less-fettered access to the Internet. But earlier this week, after a number of V.P.N. companies, including StrongVPN and Golden Frog, complained that the Chinese government had disrupted their services with unprecedented sophistication, a senior official for the first time acknowledged its hand in the attacks and implicitly promised more of the same. The move to disable some of the most widely used V.P.N.s has provoked a torrent of outrage among video artists, entrepreneurs and professors who complain that in its quest for so-called cyber-sovereignty” — Beijing’s euphemism for online filtering — the Communist Party is stifling the innovation and productivity needed to revive the Chinese economy at a time of slowing growth. Multinational companies are also alarmed by the growing online constraints. Especially worrisome, they say, are new regulations that would force foreign technology and telecom companies to give the government “back doors” to their hardware and software and require them to store data within China. Like their Chinese counterparts, Western business owners have been complaining about their inability to gain access to many Google services since the summer. A few weeks ago, China cut off the ability to receive Gmail on smartphones through third-party email services like Apple Mail or Microsoft Outlook. The recent disabling of several widely used V.P.N.s has made it difficult for company employees to use collaborative programs like Google Docs, although some people have found workarounds — for the time being. By interfering with Astrill and several other popular virtual private networks, or V.P.N.s, the government has complicated the lives of Chinese astronomers seeking the latest scientific data from abroad, graphic designers shopping for clip art on Shutterstock and students submitting online applications to American universities.Chinese government seems to back down on report criticized Alibaba: Hovering over the results was a white paper about Alibaba issued on Wednesday by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, or S.A.I.C., a Chinese regulator. The letter said the agency had discovered “the long-term existence of illegal problems regarding the management of transaction activity and other issues.” The agency said that it presented findings to Alibaba executives in a July 17 meeting at the company’s headquarters in the eastern city of Hangzhou, but that it had kept the results confidential at the time so as “not to affect Alibaba’s preparations for a stock market listing.” Alibaba began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in September. Though the end result of the S.A.I.C. investigation is not yet clear, by Thursday afternoon Alibaba appeared to have scored a victory against the regulator when the white paper was removed from the agency’s website without explanation. In New York trading on Thursday, the company’s shares closed more than 8 percent lower.In an unusual move, a Chinese government agency slammed Alibaba, sending its stock down 4%: Alibaba hit back, personally criticizing a government official. More coverage here: In unusually blunt criticism, a Chinese government agency on Wednesday took aim at the e-commerce giant Alibaba Group for what it said were unlicensed merchants, fake goods and other illegal practices on its hugely popular shopping websites. The news sent Alibaba’s shares down more than 4 percent in New York China’s main corporate regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, released a report summarizing its findings of the deficiencies on Alibaba’s sites, including Taobao Marketplace and Tmall.com. In a statement on its website, the regulator said that after a thorough review, it had discovered “the long-term existence of illegal problems regarding the management of transaction activity and other issues.” The agency said that it had presented the findings to unidentified top Alibaba executives in a July 17 meeting at the company’s headquarters in the eastern city of Hangzhou, but that it had kept the results confidential at the time so as “not to affect Alibaba’s preparations for a stock market listing.” Alibaba went on to raise a record $25 billion in September in an initial public offering in New York. The regulator’s report, first made public on Wednesday, said it had found 19 problems in five main areas on Alibaba’s sites. Those included a number of unlicensed or unregistered vendors selling items, including knockoffs and goods that were improperly imported or banned from sale in China. Such items included fake cigarettes, wine and mobile phones; knockoff handbags; gambling equipment; wiretapping devices; and restricted types of knives. In a response on its verified account on the social messaging service Weibo, Taobao on Wednesday said that it had been a victim of fakes and had gone to great lengths to prevent them from being sold on its site. At the same time, the company took issue with the regulator’s approach, saying that it “welcomes fair and just supervision” but that the agency had not been objective. Taobao went further still, and in a rarely seen public criticism of a government official, it accused Liu Hongliang, a bureau chief at the administration for industry and commerce, of using inappropriate procedures in carrying out his investigation. The company said it would file a formal complaint to the agency.\"Secure and controllable\": Chinese rules on technology have significant and worrying implications for technology firms: China will force companies which sell computer equipment to banks to hand over secret source code, undergo sensitive audits and set up research and development centers in the country, the New York Times reported on Thursday. Beijing wants 75 percent of technology products used by China's financial institutions \"secure and controllable\" by 2019, the paper reported, citing an official document expected to be circulated to businesses in the next few months. The new rules have aggravated concerns among foreign companies that Chinese authorities are trying to force them out of the country, the Times said. Approved by authorities late last year, the rules do not specify what is meant by \"secure and controllable\", the paper added. Source code - the usually tightly guarded commands that create programs - for most computing and networking equipment would have to be turned over to officials, according to the incoming regulations. Firms planning to sell computer equipment to Chinese banks would have to set up research and development centers in the country, get permits for workers servicing technology equipment and build \"ports\" which enable Chinese officials to manage and monitor data processed by their hardware. It quoted a letter sent on Wednesday to a top-level Communist Party committee on cybersecurity from foreign business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, accusing them of protectionism.Apple Pay is “doing exceptionally well,” Steve Weinstein, an analyst at ITG Investment Research Inc., said in an interview before the earnings. “Once somebody uses it, it becomes a little over 5 percent of transactions that they were doing. It’s a lot. It’s really surprising, because you can’t even use Apple Pay in that many locations.” Twenty percent to 30 percent of people who buy the new iPhones activate Apple Pay, Weinstein said. A smaller percentage uses the service regularly. “It seems that Apple Pay was a motivating factor for people buying the iPhone,” Nick Holland, an analyst at financial-services consultant Javelin Strategy & Research, said in an interview. A “double-digit” percentage of about 2,000 consumers Javelin surveyed last year after the service debuted said Apple Pay was part of the reason for their decision to buy a new Apple device.Apple is getting consumers to pay more for phones even as industry trends move in the other direction: Apple's sales figures are all the more impressive because they come at a time when the worldwide market for expensive smartphones is dropping. According to research from the Consumer Electronics Association, the average selling price of a smartphone has fallen from $440 to an expected $275 in just five years. The full price of the cheapest iPhone is $649. In fact, the average price of an iPhone actually went up, thanks to the popularity of the iPhone 6 Plus, which starts at $749. That's right; Apple's actually getting us to pay more for our phones. (Of course, most are purchased at subsidized prices through wireless carriers).Long overshadowed by its rival Alibaba, JD has emerged as China’s other online goliath by carving out its own distinct identity: While Alibaba’s marketplace serves as a platform to connect buyers and sellers, JD buys goods from manufacturers and distributors and holds the inventory in its own warehouses, in a model that echoes Amazon’s. It then arranges for quick delivery of virtually everything from television sets and refrigerators to socks and T-shirts, using motorbikes that weave in and out of traffic in some of the country’s biggest cities. Like Amazon, JD has invested heavily in infrastructure, pumping more than $1.5 billion into building and leasing warehouses and order-fulfillment centers around China. But JD has gone even further, venturing into home delivery with its own fleet of trucks and more than 20,000 couriers, all in the hope of capturing what is projected to be a $1 trillion Chinese e-commerce market by 2020. JD, which is publicly traded in the United States, is now China’s biggest direct-sales retailer, with 46 million active users and an estimated $20 billion in revenue last year. “This isn’t a business model for everyone, but they were smart to build it,” said Elinor Leung, a Hong Kong-based Internet analyst at CLSA, an investment bank. “Now, their traffic is exploding.” And yet this costly approach to building an online retailer has worried some analysts, who say that JD could be weighed down by its physical assets and mounting debt. Several analysts say the company won’t turn a profit before 2017. Competitors like Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba, have even disparaged the company’s business model, calling it tragically flawed. “It’s not that we are better,” Mr. Ma said in a recently published interview. “It’s an issue of direction. So, I tell my people: Definitely do not get involved with JD.com. Don’t come blaming us if you die one day.” He later apologized for his comments. Executives at JD, which is based in Beijing, insist they are building a company that will eventually have a commanding advantage in e-commerce, with strong customer service, speedy delivery and assurances that the products it ships are authentic, not counterfeit. Among the biggest challenges now, they say, is keeping up with an enormous volume of online orders, which have doubled in each of the last three years. “If we wanted, we could be profitable right now,” said Shen Haoyu, chief executive of JD Mall, the company’s biggest division. “But our immediate goal is to grow our customer base.” the company boasts seven fulfillment centers and 118 warehouses in 39 cities. There are also 1,045 smaller pickup centers in about 500 cities. And since 2010, the company has pledged that most online orders placed before 11 at night will be delivered by 3 p.m. the next day. Morgan Stanley calls JD’s business model a combination of Amazon and UPS; other analysts say the company is beginning to look like Walmart, steeped in logistics and infrastructure and backed by a website.Microsoft buys R startup Revolution Analytics to boost the data analytics offering of its cloud suite: Microsoft bought Revolution Analytics which makes tools to sift through data, to help the company build up its cloud-services business. Terms weren’t disclosed. The deal was driven by the growing volumes of data that companies are contending with and the need for more software that can help analyze the information, Microsoft said in a blog post on Friday. Revolution Analytics, based in Mountain View, California, makes a statistics programming language called R that helps analyze data. David Smith, chief community officer at Revolution Analytics, said in a blog post that the deal will spread the usage of advanced analytics within Microsoft products, including the Azure cloud service. Revolution Analytics counts financial companies such as American Century Investments and Northern Trust as customers, according to the company’s website. The R programming language is widely used by statisticians and scientists and has surged in popularity as people have turned to it to manipulate large pools of data. R was the world’s 18th most popular programming language in January, according to a study conducted by Tiobe Software, compared to 44th a year earlier. In a separate study, researcher RedMonk put R as the world’s 13th most popular programming language in January, up from 15th in 2014.Online Storage Company Box Has Strong Debut in First Day of Trading: Although questions had arisen about how Box’s initial public offering would fare, public investors gave the company a warm welcome on Friday, its first day of trading. Shares in Box, the online file storage company, opened at $20.20 on Friday morning, 44 percent higher than its I.P.O. price of $14 a share. The stock continued to surge to close the day at $23.23, up nearly 66 percent, giving the company a market value of $2.7 billion. At that level, the start-up has surpassed the $2.4 billion valuation that it fetched in its most recent private financing round last summer. Its strong first-day performance may ease some concerns among investors that highflying Silicon Valley start-ups were looking overvalued. Now that it has gone public, nearly a year after kicking off the process during a period of market upheaval, Box can focus on a more pressing issue: standing out in an industry that has quickly filled with competition, particularly from much bigger rivals like Google and Microsoft.Yahoo likely to announce plans to avoid huge tax hit on Alibaba windfall - two possible structures considered plausible: Yahoo on Tuesday is expected to reveal something most companies usually try to keep secret: how it plans to avoid a multibillion-dollar tax bill. The Web portal has spent more than a year figuring out how to cash out a chunk of its $40 billion stake in China-based Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Typically, a U.S. company faces a federal tax bill of about 35 percent when it sells stock in another enterprise for cash. Yahoo took a $3 billion tax hit last year when it sold about $10 billion in Alibaba shares. This time around, activist investors are leaning on the Sunnyvale, California-based company to be more savvy. Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive officer, probably will maintain at least part of the Alibaba holding to keep a finger in China’s fast-growing Web market. Were Yahoo to sell the entire stake, it could face a federal tax bill of as much as $14 billion.Here are some of Yahoo’s options to avoid capital-gains tax, both legal: Option One: Last summer, John Malone’s Liberty Ventures wanted to avoid taxes on selling its stake in travel website TripAdvisor Inc. Liberty did so by transferring that stake, as well as online costume-retailer BuySeasons, to a new unit created specifically for the deal. Under the plan, the new unit took out a $400 million bank loan. Most of that cash was destined for Liberty and the new unit’s stock spun off to Liberty shareholders. The expectation was that TripAdvisor would acquire the new unit in exchange for the travel site’s own stock. TripAdvisor also agreed to repay the $400 million loan. When it’s all wrapped up, Liberty Ventures gets cash and exits TripAdvisor -- without incurring the tax bill a straight sale would trigger. Liberty’s shareholders get stock in TripAdvisor as though Liberty had distributed its holding in the site to its own investors. Liberty’s investors also don’t face taxes on the deal. In Yahoo’s case, it would spin off its stake into a new entity, which would borrow money and distribute the cash to the Internet company. “The tax savings sort of gets carved up between the two parties and they each get a chunk,” Option Two: Another option is to follow Warren Buffett’s lead, with what’s known in tax circles as the cash-rich split. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Graham Holdings Co. last March agreed to a deal that lets Buffett’s company unload its stake in the former Washington Post Co. while avoiding capital-gains tax. That deal called for Graham to transfer cash and a Miami television business -- combined, roughly equal to Berkshire Hathaway’s investment -- into a new subsidiary. Graham then shifts stock in that new unit to Berkshire Hathaway, while Buffett’s company moves its Graham stake back to the media company. Economically, it’s as though Berkshire Hathaway sold its Graham stake for cash -- and a TV station. But because the deal is structured as an exchange of shares, not a straight-up sale, it gets tax-free treatment. Were Yahoo to follow this route, it would exchange Alibaba shares for a stake in a new unit that would consist mostly of cash. Alibaba would have to shed some assets for Yahoo to get the advantage of such a deal; a cash-only transaction probably would trigger a tax bill. Accounting experts say it shouldn’t be difficult to find something to throw in the pot.As Alibaba and Chinese investors pour into Israel, the nation's high-tech startups scored big exits in 2014: With nearly $15 billion in exits through mergers and acquisitions and public offerings, 2014 was an all-time record year for the Israeli hi-tech industry, compared with a mere $1.2 billion raised in 2013, according to a PwC report for 2014. The exits were spread out between a variety of tech industries, including Internet, IT, life sciences, communications and semiconductors. Semiconductors had a 38% of the share, but just one semiconductor IPO out of the 18 in total. The road accident avoidance technology developerMobilEye raised $1.023 billion in its August IPO, a record an Israeli company. As for new giant exits emerging, most argue that Israel’s hi-tech diversity is its strength. “While there seems to be a general hype around IoT, security and fintech, I find Israel to be a very unique place in the fact that entrepreneurs don’t tend to have group think and as such, we are seeing ventures tackling a very wide array of industries.” said Yaron Carni, the founder of two Israeli VC fundsMaverick Ventures and Tel Aviv Angel Group. And more international companies are beginning to take notice of Israel’s technological strengths. In fact, 2014 ended with a news item that might indicate China’s increasingly hefty presence in the Israeli hi-tech sector. Last year might be remembered as the time when Chinese technology companies embraced Israeli startups in a big way. On December 20, The Chinese eCommerce giant Alibaba invested in Visualead, a company that specializes in QR code generation. Based in Herzliya, the Israeli equivalent of Silicon Valley, the 15-person start-up was Aliababa’s first Israeli acquisition. Last September, China’s Yuanda Enterprise Group bought AutoAgronome, a maker of smart irrigation and fertilization systems for $20 million in order to move into high-tech agriculture.Box prices IPO - implied valuation of $1.6B, 33% discount to last funding as Box struggles to rise from storage play to platform play: (More here) Box Inc. is set to price its initial public offering at a discount to its latest financing round, as stiff competition overshadows the cloud-storage company’s plans to expand into new areas. The IPO comes almost a year after Box, which lets businesses manage, store and have access to data over the Web instead of through onsite computers, first filed to go public. The company’s financials in its March prospectus underwhelmed some investors just as deep-pocketed competitors including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) were entering the fray, and the IPO was delayed. Ten months later, Box’s losses have narrowed as revenue surged 70 percent in the most recent quarter, and the company is offering new services that could help it retain and increase its customer base. The company, led by 29-year-old Aaron Levie, is still valuing itself below the level it fetched in a July private-financing round, betting the combination of its turnaround plan and cheaper price will lure buyers. “Investors are either going to have to buy into that story that they can diversify their business, or that this is coming cheap and that there will be consolidation,” said James Gellert, the president and chief executive officer of Rapid Ratings International Inc., which uses quantitative models to grade securities. Box, based in Los Altos, California, is seeking as much as $163 million from the IPO, scheduled to price Jan. 22. It is offering 12.5 million shares for $11 to $13 apiece, according to a Jan. 9 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Those terms indicate a valuation as high as $1.6 billion, reflecting a 33 percent discount to the $2.4 billion Box was valued at during a private round by investors including TPG Capital and Coatue Management LLC. The market for file sharing and synchronization software is forecast to grow 23 percent a year on average to $2.3 billion in 2018, market researcher IDC said in a report looking at 2013. The enterprise side of the market, where Box fits, is growing slightly faster at 27 percent a year. Box had 14 percent share in the overall market, behind Dropbox Inc. with 27 percent and Microsoft with 17 percent. The challenge for Box, said IDC’s Maureen Fleming, is that Microsoft has been dropping prices for its OneDrive and including it free for customers who are signing up to use its Office apps online. That means many corporate customers decide to at least try OneDrive, curbing Box’s growth rates. Fleming regards Box as superior to OneDrive for companies looking for cloud-based systems but said product quality doesn’t always matter to chief information officers in the market for software. In response to those price wars, Box has created ancillary services on top of storage to differentiate its offerings. They include programs to help companies to build custom applications as well as security features that can be customized. The company also has a consulting arm, which helps customers navigate its services. Said Eli Lilly CIO Mike Meadows: “They are doing the right things and saying the right things,But we haven’t come across the use case that would drive us using them in more of platform mode rather than just a storage mode.”A big day for Microsoft, which unveiled lots more about Windows 10, a new browser named Spartan, and Windows Holographic, an augmented reality headset: the next generation of its operating system, including how it will work across mobile, tablet, desktop and other platforms. The biggest surprise was probably the new HoloLens augmented reality headset Microsoft created, and the Windows Holographic software it built to support said gadget: Microsoft Reveals Windows Holographic, An Augmented Reality User Interface For The World. Microsoft To Bring Xbox One Game Streaming to Windows 10 Devices Later This Year. Microsoft Previews Windows 10, Unveils New Internet Browser: Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), seeking to use the next version of its Windows software to win back consumers and keep business customers happy, gave a detailed look at the new operating system and took the wraps off a revamped Web browser. At an event Wednesday to preview Windows 10, the new iteration of its flagship personal-computer software, Microsoft showed the browser that will succeed Internet Explorer, code-named Project Spartan. The update to Windows, coming later this year, will also bring Cortana, the voice-activated digital assistant, to PC desktops, and will have touch-enabled Office applications such as Word and Excel built-in for smartphones and tablets. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who took the helm almost a year ago, is trying to resuscitate Windows even as mobile computing continues to surge, PC demand sputters, and Microsoft focuses on versions of its Office applications for rival software platforms. He’s also tasked with overhauling the product little more than two years after the last update -- Windows 8 -- failed to jump-start consumer demand while alienating corporate customers. Microsoft also announced Windows Holographic, and a headset with glasses called HoloLens that will enable users to see holograms while tracking a user’s voice, motion and surroundings. The glasses will be available “in the Windows 10 timeframe,” said Alex Kipman, a technical fellow in Microsoft’s operating system group. The company also showed HoloStudio, software tools for creating holograms, 3-D printing them and sharing them. The new browser showed today lets users annotate websites using a stylus and touch or mouse and keyboard, and then send and share comments through e-mail and social media. The company also announced a new device called the Surface Hub, an 84-inch touch-screen computer designed for workplace collaboration that will run Windows 10.Uber closes $1.6 Billion in convertible debt that incentivize Uber to IPO in less than 4 years; also in talks to raise $600M in Series E; valuation at $41.2B: Uber, the popular ride-hailing start-up, has closed $1.6 billion in financing from clients of Goldman Sachs’s private wealth arm, the investment bank confirmed on Wednesday. The new round of financing comes just months after the company raised $1.2 billion from big institutions. Including that investment, the company is valued at some $41.2 billion, one of the richest-ever valuations for a private start-up. Moreover, Uber may still raise an additional $600 million in stock from hedge funds and strategic overseas investors, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are ongoing. The funding adds to Uber’s already overflowing war chest; to date, the company has raised upward of $4 billion. With the new cash, Uber has more incentive to take on a new life as a publicly traded company. The securities sold to Goldman’s clients — in what was one of the biggest-ever sales of convertible debt — can be converted into shares in the start-up once it begins trading on a stock exchange, at a discount of 20 percent to 30 percent of the price set in an initial public offering, people briefed on the matter have said. Should the company not stage an I.P.O. within four years, however, the interest rate on those securities will rise.Shazam, a smartphone app that identifies songs playing on TV/radio, raised $30M at ~$1B valuation: Shazam, a smartphone application that can identify songs, announced on Wednesday that it had raised $30 million in new funding round that valued the company at roughly $1 billion. The start-up, which was founded in London and has around 100 monthly million users worldwide, has been rumored to be moving toward an initial public offering. It is expected to join other fast-growing technology companies that have tapped the public markets in recent months. Shazam uses audio-recognition technology to allow people to identify songs by holding their smartphone or other mobile device next to a television or radio. The company’s technology typically identifies the song within seconds, and Shazam generates revenue from taking a percentage of sales from music found through its app and mobile advertising. As tech giants like Google and Amazon move aggressively into Shazam’s core music market, the company has reached a series of deals to expand its core business. Among them is an agreement with the Warner Music Group to create a label imprint for new artists who are discovered through Shazam. Shazam has also made deals with a number of brands and blue-chip advertisers allowing individuals to view additional content on cellphones or tablets about products when they use Shazam’s app with certain television commercials.Alibaba is everywhere: invests in an Israeli QR code startup, and also seeks a stake in a giant state-owned Chinese insurance firm: QR Codes: Alibaba invests in Visualead, an Israeli startup that generates QR codes. Alibaba has announced it has helped raise a series B round in Israel’s Visualead, a startup that lets users generate visually appealing QR codes. The size of Alibaba’s investment remains undisclosed, but Visualead has previously raised US$2.4 million to according to CrunchBase. Visualead helps small business create QR codes that blend into images more seamlessly than standard black-and-white QR codes. Using the company’s web-based service, users can upload images, specify urls, and generate QR codes that mesh into the particular graphic. The company offers numerous tiers for individuals and enterprises based on the number of QR codes they hope to create. According to a release from Visualead, Alibaba will help its Taobao and Tmall vendors integrate Visualead into their marketing initiatives. The Chinese ecommerce giant has its own QR-code initiative, Mashangtao, which helps merchants create QR codes for any number of purposes like parcel tracking or marketing. Insurance: Alibaba is planning to buy shares in the state-run New China Life Insurance Shanghai Securities News said on Wednesday, citing unnamed sources. Alibaba is already invested in China's insurance market. The founders of Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) were among a consortium of investors who purchased stakes in Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (2318.HK) (601318.SS) in a HK$36.5 billion ($4.7 billion) deal in December. New China Life Insurance has a market capitalisation of $24 billion and provides life insurance services and products. Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu are starting to make increasingly similar investments and behave more and more alike: Before China became the biggest smartphone market, there was little overlap between the businesses of e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, social networking firm Tencent Holdings Ltd and search engine provider Baidu Inc. Now, as more and more Chinese use their phones for everything from shopping to booking restaurants, the three companies are increasingly stepping over each other - and investing in the same services - to attract the same users. In little over a month, taxi-hailing apps Didi Dache, supported by Tencent, and Alibaba-funded Kuaidi Dache raised over half a billion dollars each, while U.S. taxi app Uber attracted an undisclosed sum from Baidu. The next arena looks set to be group-buying services, where customers agree to buy a certain item or service at the same time to gain discounts. Baidu bought out Nuomi last year and Alibaba-backed Meituan on Monday said it raised $700 million, valuing the company at $7 billion.Rumors have it that Olacabs might be close to raising another $300-500M at $2B: Barely three months after Mumbai-based ANI Technologies Pvt Ltd, the company behind Olacabs, an online marketplace for cabs and car rental services, raised $210 million led by SoftBank, it is back in the market to scoop between $300-500 million more, sources privy to the development told Techcircle.in. “Ola has doubled in size in terms of revenue run rate since its last fundraise when it was valued at $1 billion. It is now seeking twice the valuation,” said one of the sources. The source added that it is likely to rope in at least two new investors including a New York-based fund besides a Hong Kong-based fund house, besides participation from most of its existing investors. “While one of the new investors is a hedge fund, the other is a PE investor,” he said. The proposed fundraising, which would be its Series E or fifth round of institutional funding, would strengthen its position as the most heavily funded player in its business. It would also make it the third most funded new generation tech venture behind Flipkart and Snapdeal. One97 which operates Paytm is in the final stage of scooping a large round. Olacabs had raised $210 million in its Series D round led by Japanese internet and telecom giant SoftBank. Previously, it raised Rs 250 crore ($41.8 million) in its Series C round of funding led by Hong Kong-based hedge fund manager Steadview Capital and Silicon Valley-based Sequoia Capital. Existing investors Matrix Partners India and Tiger Global Management also participated in this round. In November 2013, Olacabs had raised its Series B round of funding led by Matrix Partners India for a big minority stake, with participation from existing investor Tiger Global Management. Although the company had not disclosed the amount at the time, media reports pegged it at $20 million. Prior to that, it had raised Rs 19.2 crore ($3.2 million) from existing investor Tiger Global in July the same year, which was believed to be part of the same round. Back in 2012, the company had raised over $5 million in its Series A funding from Tiger Global. Prior to that, it had raised angel funding from a bunch of individual investors, including Rehan Yar Khan and Anupam Mittal. In the cab booking segment, Ola is seen as the biggest player competing with Google Ventures-backed global major Uber and domestic players such as TaxiForSure (backed by Accel Partners and Bessemer Venture Partners), Savaari, taxiGUIDE and Cabs24X7.Big-data based lending story #1: Small startups attempt to use borrower profiling models that use behavioral signals to cut default rates on student loans, personal loans: When bankers of the future decide whether to make a loan, they may look to see if potential customers use only capital letters when filling out forms, or at the amount of time they spend online reading terms and conditions — and not so much at credit history. These signals about behavior — picked up by sophisticated software that can scan thousands of pieces of data about online and offline lives — are the focus of a handful of start-ups that are creating new models of lending. No single signal is definitive, but each is a piece in a mosaic, a predictive picture, compiled by collecting an array of information from diverse sources, including household buying habits, bill-paying records and social network connections. It amounts to a digital-age spin on the most basic principle of banking: Know your customer. Yet the technology is so new that the potential is unproved. Also, applying the modern techniques of data science to consumer lending raises questions, especially for regulators who enforce anti-discrimination laws. None of the new start-ups are consumer banks in the full-service sense of taking deposits. Instead, they are focused on transforming the economics of underwriting and the experience of consumer borrowing — and hope to make more loans available at lower cost for millions of Americans. Earnest uses the new tools to make personal loans. Affirm, another start-up, offers alternatives to credit cards for online purchases. And another, ZestFinance, has focused on the relative niche market of payday loans. They all envision consumer finance fueled by abundant information and clever software — the tools of data science, or big data — as opposed to the traditional math of creditworthiness, which relies mainly on a person’s credit history. Investors certainly see the potential; money and talent are flowing into this emerging market. Major banks, credit card companies and Internet giants are watching the upstarts and studying their techniques — and watching for the perils. By law, lenders cannot discriminate against loan applicants on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age or the receipt of public assistance. Big-data lending, though, relies on software algorithms largely working on their own and learning as they go. The danger is that with so much data and so much complexity, an automated system is in control. The software could end up discriminating against certain racial or ethnic groups without being programmed to do so. The data-driven lending start-ups see opportunity. As many as 70 million Americans either have no credit score or a slender paper trail of credit history that depresses their score, according to estimates from the National Consumer Reporting Association, a trade organization. Two groups that typically have thin credit files are immigrants and recent college graduates. Affirm says it is on track to lend $100 million during its first 12 months. More than 100 online merchants are now using its installment loan product, Buy With Affirm. Next up, the company says, will be student loans. Earnest was founded in 2013, and began lending last year. In 2014, its loans reached $8 million, growing gradually. By December the month-to-month growth rate was 70 percent, Mr. Beryl said. The typical Earnest loan is for a few thousand dollars, though they can range up to $30,000. Many of the loans are for relocation expenses and for professional training.Big-data based lending story #2: Payday loans - where every borrower has poor history - attract big data models too, but fairness and discrimination concerns persist: The payday market is a niche compared with mainstream consumer and credit-card loans, two markets where start-ups are now applying data science to lending, as I wrote about in an article on Monday. Still, the payday market is a sizable niche. At any given time, there are an estimated 22 million payday loans outstanding, and the fees paid by payday borrowers amount to about $8 billion a year — a lot of money for those in the working population least able to afford it. Mr. Merrill saw a market in need of greater efficiency, a business opportunity — and the potential to lower costs to borrowers. ZestFinance has been practicing big data-style underwriting longer than most other start-ups. Founded in 2009, ZestFinance made its first loan in late 2010 and has increased its lending steadily since, having underwritten more than 100,000 loans. Its loans are called ZestCash, and the company is authorized to be a direct lender in seven states including Texas, Louisiana and Missouri. ZestFinance also handles the underwriting for Spotloan, an online lender that is part of BlueChip Financial, which is owned by the Turtle Mountain Band of the Chippewa Indian tribe of North Dakota. Winning over state regulators has been a slow process. “We’re showing up with a different kind of math,” said Mr. Merrill, who is now the chief executive of ZestFinance. “And that’s going to make it more difficult from a regulatory standpoint.” A healthy dose of caution is in order, policy analysts say. A recent report, by Robinson & Yu, a policy consulting firm, looked at new data methods as a way to make credit available to more Americans. In the report, supported by the Ford Foundation, ZestFinance was the featured example of big data underwriting, which it called “fringe alternative scoring models.” “I have no doubt that they have come up with neat correlations that are predictive,” said Aaron Rieke, co-author of the report and a former lawyer at the Federal Trade Commission. But the concern about ZestFinance and other start-up lenders using big data methods, Mr. Rieke said, is that “we have no idea how to talk about or assess the fairness of their predictions.” Mr. Merrill believes that such qualms will fade as data science lenders build a track record of offering lower costs and greater convenience to borrowers. The typical payday loan, Mr. Merrill explains, is for a few hundred dollars for two weeks, and rolls over 10 times on average, or 22 weeks. In a traditional payday loan, all the fees are paid upfront with the principal paid at the end, in a “balloon” payment. With ZestCash loans, borrowers are paying down principal with every payment, which reduces the cost. It also charges lower fees. In a traditional payday loan, Mr. Merrill said, a person would typically pay $1,500 to borrow $500 for 22 weeks. Using ZestCash, he says, a borrower generally pays $920 to borrow $500 for 22 weeks — still hefty fees, but far less than a standard payday loan. ZestFinance can charge less, Mr. Merrill said, largely because its data-sifting algorithms reduce the risk of default by more than 40 percent compared with a typical payday loan, and the software is being constantly tweaked to improve further. Borrowing candidates are asked to fill out an online form with their name, address, Social Security number, bank account information and a few other questions. ZestFinance then combines that with streams of information from data brokers and online sources, and sets its algorithms to work. The automated risk analysis, Mr. Merrill said, is done in a matter of seconds. The person is informed of the decision online. If approved, a customer service representative soon calls to verify the borrower’s identity, double check on numbers, and go through the loan terms again by phone. The data signals used to assess risk in the payday market are different than for most consumer loans. “In our space,” Mr. Merrill observed, “virtually everyone has a bankruptcy.” In payday underwriting, by contrast, signs of financial stability would include how long a person has had his or her current cellphone number or the length of time on a current job.How can Xiaomi be so aggressive with its pricing? A small portfolio and longer average selling time. Many theories have been put forward, including claims that Xiaomi sells at cost and makes money from other services. Hugo Barra, the company’s VP of International, lifted the lid on some of the company’s secret sauce in an interview with TechCrunch in Beijing last week. Barra explained that Xiaomi is able to make price concessions thanks to the combination of a small portfolio and longer average selling time per device. Importantly, Xiaomi continues to sell older devices (and tweaked versions of them) at reduced prices even after it releases newer models. “A product that stays on the shelf for 18-24 months — which is most of our products — goes through three or four price cuts. The Mi2 and Mi2s are essentially the same device, for example,” Barra explained. “The Mi2/Mi2s were on sale for 26 months. The Redmi 1 was first launched in September 2013, and we just announced the Redmi 2 this month, that’s 16 months later.” That’s important because the longer runway for devices gives Xiaomi leverage to secure better component deals with its suppliers. “The reason we do these price cuts is because we’ve managed to negotiate component cost decreases [with our suppliers] over time, which ends up leaving us with a bigger margin than we’d like to have, so we do a price cut,” Barra added. “The vast majority of the components [in our devices] are still the same, so in terms of supply chain and component sourcing, we’re on the same supply contracts as Redmi 1, which means we’re still getting the same discounts on components,” he explained. “We can continue to ride the cost curve, so the importance of having a very small portfolio is significant — the fact that we only launch a few products each year, and (the fact that) we only have two product families.” There are other factors that contribute to the cost structure, including Xiaomi’s lean, online-only marketing focus and its location close to manufacturing plants in China , but the management of components and supply chain partnerships is a crucial element. The company sells its phone using an online-only model in most markets, but it has recently begun testing operator partnerships outside of China. It is running a limited trial with Airtel in India, and has found partners in Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore. Barra explained that operator partnerships are difficult in markets where the majority of consumers are on pre-paid tariffs — such as India — but it seems clear that Xiaomi is looking into ways to expand its retail footprint. It sold one million devices in its first five months in India using its flash sales model. If it can move beyond that and better meet demand for its phones in India and other emerging markets, it could vastly increase its sales figures in 2015.Indian e-com marketplace ShopClues raises $100M in Series D led by Tiger Global; despite turbulent history,ShopClues is now valued $450-500M: Clues Network Inc, the US-based parent of Clues Network Pvt Ltd that runs the horizontal e-commerce marketplace ShopClues, has raised $100 million (Rs 620 crore) in Series D funding led by Tiger Global besides two of its existing investors, the firm said on Monday. This values the company at around $450-500 million, a company executive privy to the development said on the condition of anonymity. The money will be used in product development and roping in more merchants on board, the firm said. The company had previously raised money from Helion Venture Partners, Nexus Partners and Beenos (formerly Netprice, a Japanese incubation cum investment group). It scooped $10 million in Series B round in March 2013. Prior to that it had raised around $5 million in Series A. It also raised an undisclosed amount—which is believed to be around $15-20 million— in Series C in April-May 2014 from Nexus and Helion. “So far we have brought 100,000 sellers and 10 million products online and the next three years will be focused on bringing 10 million sellers and 1 billion products to the online domain. We will continue to build technologies and services to enable and empower retailers to participate in the e-commerce revolution that is happening in India,” said Sanjay Sethi, CEO and co-founder, ShopClues. Lee Fixel from Tiger Global said, “Shopclues has emerged as the leading marketplace of choice for the millions of small and local businesses seeking to reach mass consumers in India’s tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Sanjay, Radhika and the team have done a great job aggregating the country’s largest online catalogue of regional and local brands and we are excited to partner with ShopClues as it expands its offerings.” The Gurgaon-based startup was founded by former Wall Street tech analyst Sandeep Aggarwal and a former eBay executive Sanjay Sethi in July 2011. The company went through a tumultuous period over the last two years after Aggarwal (then CEO) was found to have indulged in insider trading in the US in his past job and he later pleaded guilty to the charges. He has disassociated himself with his executive role at ShopClues. His wife Radhika Ghai Aggarwal has taken over more a direct role and is handling marketing at the firm and listed as a co-founder now. Meanwhile, Sethi became CEO after Sandeep Aggarwal was arrested in the US. A few months back ShopClues was again in news when one of the merchants selling through its platform was found to be allegedly selling counterfeit products under the L’Oreal brand. The Delhi High Court had restrained it from using the name of L’Oreal to sell or supply any goods. Currently, ShopClues claims to be doing 1.5 million transactions per month with 70 per cent of it coming from tier II & III cities. It claims to have 40 million monthly visitors. The firm had clocked net revenues of around Rs 30 crore with net loss of Rs 38 crore for the year ended March 31, 2014.Online insurance sales are squeezing agents in the US as Google, other tech firms find the insurance sector ripe for disruption: Technology start-ups, and companies from the insurance industry, are introducing websites that sell or promote a range of insurance including auto, homeowners and small commercial policies. These portals, which promise savings by showing consumers many price quotes so they do not have to shop site by site, are putting pressure on insurance agents, who collect 10 percent or more of their policyholders’ payments.Online insurance comparison is still a nascent business, and it has yet to make a dent in the armies of intermediaries that are the backbone of the trade. But people in the industry and Silicon Valley say it is only a matter of time. Even Google is getting involved.“There are 40,000 agencies in the U.S., and you could absolutely imagine them shrinking by a quarter, and the ones that are left will deal with more complicated needs and more affluent customers,” said Ellen Carney, an analyst who covers insurance for Forrester Research.The idea of selling insurance online is not new. Lately, though, the boring but lucrative trade has been attracting big names. The most recent is Google.Its Google Compare auto insurance site (basically a search engine for auto insurance prices) has been operating in Britain for two years, and Google is working on something similar for the United States. Google is licensed to sell insurance in about half of the states, according to research by Ms. Carney.Google has formed a partnership with Comparenow, an American auto insurance comparison site owned by Admiral Group, a British car insurance company that has operated a European price-comparison site for more than a decade. The venture will give Google access to insurers in Comparenow’s network.Admiral Group introduced Comparenow about a year ago. Not long after, Overstock.com, a retailer, started selling auto and other forms of insurance.Then there is Walmart, which does not sell insurance but recently formed a partnership with AutoInsurance.com. The insurer leases space in Walmarts, giving it access to the 140 million people who shop there each week. “A lot of people are waking up to the fact that it’s a massive industry, it’s old-fashioned, they still use human agents and the commissions are pretty big,” said Jennifer Fitzgerald, the founder and chief executive of PolicyGenius. “It’s ripe for — I hate to use the word — disruption.” Insurance is a fat target. In 2013, insurers wrote $481 billion in premiums for property and casualty insurance, which consists of mostly auto, home and commercial insurance, according to the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group. That would place a rough estimate of agents’ commissions — including commissions to small-time agents as well as to brokers who sell large commercial policies — at $50 billion. And while it might seem like an odd match for Google, whose projects include driverless cars, delivery drones and a pill to detect cancer, the key to insurance is having lots of data about people’s backgrounds and habits, which is perhaps the company’s greatest strength. “They have a ton of data on where people drive, how people drive,” said Jon McNeill, chief executive of Enservio, a Needham, Mass., company that makes claims-processing software. “It’s the holy grail of being able to price auto insurance correctly.”What's the deal? Softbank (and Alibaba) are heavily investing taxi apps that rival Uber the world over: SoftBank had no business in taxi-hailing apps until October 2014 when it led a $210 million investment in India’s Ola. That deal was announced as the first investment in SoftBank’s program to put $10 billion into startups in India. At the time, Ola appeared to be just one of a number of deals in India — while that is true, it also turned out to be the first of an expensive set of investments in companies rivals that rival Uber. SoftBank went on to invest $250 million in GrabTaxi in Southeast Asia, and last week it closed a third deal, leading a $600 million financing round for China’s Kuadi Dache. The operator, it seems is going all out for taxi apps but it may not stop in Asia. Alibaba led Lyft’s $250 million funding round in April 2014, which the U.S. company had earmarked for “international expansion”. At the time, the investment was a curious deal for Alibaba but, with the e-commerce giant backing range of other U.S. startups — including chat app Tango — it looked like an exploratory move to get some skin in promising companies in North America. However, SoftBank and Alibaba have a long history of collaboration — SoftBank is famously an early investor in Alibaba, and both companies put money into Kuadi Dache — and it could just be that Lyft forms a part of SoftBank’s taxi app focus. Perhaps the Japanese firm will put its own money in at a later date, or it will use its relationship with Alibaba to form a loose alliance to share information and tactics.A Korean urban logistics startup that aims to be \"Uber for last-mile deliveries\" is in the news and gaining traction: Seoul-based urban logistics startup Naldo is gaining some serious momentum in its home country. The company, which works sort of like an Uber for last-mile deliveries, now boasts over 500 corporate customers, tripling its client base in the last year. \"We all buy more stuff online, but we are not aware that more online purchasing requires more offline delivery. That’s why this is an overseen goldrush for us,\" Ebner-Chung says. Among its clients are steel giant Posco, social commerce site Coupang, and investment bank Kyobo Securities. Naldo founder and CEO Ludolf Ebner-Chung says the company saw revenues grow 1,000 percent in 2014, with consistent double-digit growth every month since launching two years ago. Naldo works similar to other logistics-on-demand startups, like Gogovan and Easyvan in Hong Kong. With its mostly two-wheeled fleet, it promises delivery within 90 minutes in Seoul. The site connects clients directly to available nearby drivers with no middlemen involved. Next, Ebner-Chung says the startup will soon launch a native app and an open API, which has already been tested by popular ecommerce sites like Ticketmonster, WeMakePrice, and Ridibooks. He says this will be of significant value to online SMEs as it gives them delivery options to gain an edge on their competition. It also reduces dependency on the old call center-based logistics companies. Chung says South Korea’s B2B real-time delivery market is worth US$5 billion.Rocket Internet CEO: We build real companies; work for Google if you like sushi and comfy chairs: Silicon Valley hasn’t found much to love about Rocket Internet, the Berlin-based company that is often derided for simply copying everyone else’s ideas. Turns out, the disdain is mutual. Press-shy Oliver Samwer, chief executive and cofounder of Rocket, appeared on stage today at the Digital Life Design conference in Munich, Germany, for a rare interview. While he didn’t say much new about Rocket’s business, and seemed clearly uncomfortable with having to field questions, he did manage to get in a few shots at the folks in Silicon Valley. For instance, Samwer was asked about the idea that Rocket is an incubator, like the ones in a certain other high-tech regions. At first glance, that might appear reasonable. Rocket works with entrepreneurs to build Internet companies from scratch in areas like e-commerce and travel, scales them up, and then spins them out into stand-alone companies. Like an incubator, right? No, said Samwer. He said Rocket’s approach is a methodical process, repeated over and over. In what may be the greatest definition of incubators in history, Samwer explained why he thought Rocket was not an incubator. “I don’t like this word incubator. We are a platform,” he said. “An incubator sounds like you have some crazy chairs, and then there are fancy drinks and you eat free corn flakes.” Asked about the challenge of attracting talent and competing for hires against the likes of Google, Samwer sung a similar tune. He said someone could take a low-level job at Google, or they could come to Rocket where they could eventually build their own company. “The chairs might be more comfortable at Google,” he said. “And the drinks. I hear they have sushi. We are for the real people who want to build companies.”\"The toll road into China\": Customs pre-approval, forex handling part of Alibaba's major push to connect American retailers with Chinese consumers: Anchored by Alipay, the dominant Chinese electronic payments system that works closely with Alibaba and is controlled by its executives, the world's largest Internet retailer is using the calling card of China's consumers to attract U.S. partners, two sources close to the company told Reuters. Long seen as the most potent threat to Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) with $300 billion in global sales, the moves add up to a conservative approach to expanding in the United States, contrary to industry speculation that the company may be plotting a direct assault on U.S. soil. At the heart of its push are Alibaba's and Alipay's trial deals to handle Chinese sales, payment and shipping for some of the biggest names in U.S. retail from Neiman Marcus Group [NMRCUS.UL] to Saks Inc. Both confirmed the agreement but would not talk about how the pilots are faring. The Chinese companies will also work with U.S. startup Shoprunner, an online mall for U.S. retailers in which it owns a stake, and retail services provider Borderfree Inc (BRDR.O) to court Chinese consumers. And Alibaba is preparing a marketing campaign to raise awareness among U.S. businesses of its global business-to-business wholesale platform, Alibaba.com, so they can buy and sell to and from global suppliers. Alipay and a logistics-partner network that took years to assemble are central to Alibaba's U.S. effort. Major brands, such as Nike, that have a large physical presence in China already sell directly on Tmall. But Alipay's effort directly connects American merchants with China, without the need for investment in a physical presence. It also allows U.S. retailers and Chinese consumers to avoid difficulties associated with foreign exchange. Chinese consumers pay in yuan; U.S. companies get paid in dollars. Alibaba's and Alipay's program for U.S. companies is called ePass. It includes a customs pre-approval process, a sort of \"fast lane\" that shaves days off delivery. Daiwa analysts John Choi and Alex Liu call that capability Alibaba's biggest advantage over rivals such as JD.com (JD.O). Alibaba and Alipay have made pilot agreements to handle payments and shipping to China for department stores Neiman, Saks, Macy's Inc (M.N), Macy's Bloomingdale's chain, Ann Taylor, luxury fashion site Gilt, and apparel label Aeropostale (ARO.N), according to Borderfree. The companies declined to comment, although Neiman, Saks and Ann Taylor confirmed the deal. If a Chinese consumer bought a pair of shoes from Saks, for instance, Alipay would handle the financial transaction. The shoes go to a U.S.-based Alipay facility that handles the transfer to China. After clearing customs, a local partner typically would handle final delivery. \"They own the toll road into China\"Seed funding is stagnant, but Series A and later rounds are still hot, analysis of VC funding data indicates: New data published today by Mattermark CEO and co-founder Danielle Morrill concerning the venture capital industry paints a relatively stiff picture: Seed rounds are taking it on the chin. More precisely, according to Mattermark, the number of seed rounds in 2014 fell compared to 2013, and the trend is accelerating. Bear in mind that the total dollar amount of money flowing into seed deals barely declined, so, of course, we are seeing the average seed deal increase. All this should square with your gut. It has felt for some time that the number of yahoos picking up a million dollars to build flipmeat for Yahoo has been declining. At the same time, the seed round your friend raised was almost a Series A. The data agrees. So has the seed bubble popped? I think it’s fair to say that it has despite the only slight decline in the total dollar amount that is being invested at the level. That’s due to the fact that we’ve become too loose with what counts as a seed round. So if we used an older measuring stick, the downtick would be more accelerated.Palantir raised money at $15B recently, and is looking for more: Palantir Technologies Inc. raised money at a $15 billion valuation late last year and is now looking for more funding, according to people with knowledge of the situation, as the data-analysis software startup seeks to expand its business. Palantir raised the money in late 2014 because investors were eager to invest, said one of the people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. The round totaled $500 million and was completed in November, said another person, who added that Palantir is currently raising even more financing. A Palantir representative declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Palantir’s $15 billion valuation and current funding plans. The new valuation is up from the $9 billion that Palantir was valued at in late 2013 and underscores the soaring values of startups across Silicon Valley. Uber Technologies Inc., a San Francisco-based mobile car-booking company, reeled in two financings exceeding $1 billion each last year and was valued at $40 billion last month. Investors have been pumping money into U.S. startups, to the tune of $48.3 billion last year, the most since 2000, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Palantir got its start building software that helped tie disparate databases together to make it easier to search and analyze information. The technology was a hit among police agencies and intelligence services that wanted to illuminate patterns of behavior among individuals and manage large volumes of data more efficiently. Wall Street firms have since emerged as Palantir’s biggest customers, using the company’s software to detect fraud and evaluate loans, among other things. Last March, hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP hired Palantir to boost surveillance.GoPro's stock dropped 12% after Apple patent, possibly because past Apple patents foretold gamechangers: Patents are granted all the time, but when Apple gets one, companies often shudder at the prospect that the tech giant may try to muscle into their industry. GoPro's stock dropped 12 percent after the iPhone maker got a patent for a remote control system to take photos. In 2005, Apple filed a patent for \"hand held electronic device with multiple touch sensing devices.\" About two years later, the company unveiled its first iPhone, and people walking down the street never looked up again. In May 2005, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Apple a design patent vaguely titled \"electronic device.\" But the images clearly resembled what would be revealed five years later: the iPad. If there was any doubt that Apple was going to replace Google Maps with its own app on the iPhone, that should have been put to rest in May 2012, when the Cupertino, California, company filed a patent for \"system and method for navigation guidance with destination-biased route display.\" As you might have guessed, about two weeks later, Apple announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference that it was kicking Google's app to the curb in favor of its home-cooked alternative. Before Apple Pay was announced last September, a number of the company's patents had pointed to its interest in providing a mobile payment service. One of them, filed in March 2011, was for a \"method and system for payment and/or issuance of credits via a mobile device.\"  Apple's interest in biometric security is an example where companies in that industry didn't shudder. Instead, they were elated by the attention paid to them by Apple and its rivals. Other phone makers, some of which had rudimentary fingerprint sensors predating the iPhone 5S, were less enthused. Apple showed its interest in incorporating an embedded authentication system back in this patent filed in 2008. In 2013, the iPhone 5S came with a fingerprint scanner on the device's home button.Uber plans to introduce background check procedures for its drivers in India, the company said Thursday evening, in a move that comes weeks after a driver was charged with rape there. The episode prompted wider scrutiny of the ride-hailing service that is now banned in some parts of the country. The company started operating in the Delhi region of India in late 2013, but has not screened those drivers, according to local Uber executives. Previously, Uber accepted new drivers if they presented proof of insurance, a driver’s license and a commercial permit to drive a taxi. That will soon change. Uber will run a series of more stringent checks on its drivers, which include a formal background check, verification of character by the local police and checks to detect fraud in driving and vehicle permits. Since the rape, Uber has pointed out the difficulty of screening drivers in hundreds of cities across the world, an argument that the company has also used in the United States to support its background check procedure. “This unfortunate incident has highlighted challenges in the systems due largely to nondigitized record-keeping and the lack of a centralized database for criminal offenders,” Ms. Delivala said. “To ensure verifications are legitimate and reliable, more needs to be done at the ground level.” In the United States, background checks for Uber are conducted by Hirease, a third-party service, which checks city, state and federal records. Lawmakers in many states, including California, Colorado and Illinois, have contested this approach, citing the more stringent checks required of taxi and limousine drivers.A wild day in financial markets: Surprise rate cut in India sends Indian stocks soaring, a monetary announcement in Switzerland drives Swiss markets down 10% but sends Euro-area stocks sharply higher:  India’s central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark short-term interest rates Thursday morning by a quarter percentage point as steeply falling prices for oil and other commodities have helped bring inflation under control and allowed the bank to focus more on allowing faster economic growth. The steep fall in world oil prices since the bank’s last interest rate review on Dec. 2 has been a big benefit for India, which relies almost entirely on imports for its oil and had been spending roughly $100 billion a year before oil prices plummeted. Switzerland stunned world markets on Thursday by abandoning a crucial part of its effort to hold down the value of its currency, concluding that the strategy was too risky and too costly given the enormous forces pushing in the other direction. The Swiss central bank had been trying to cap the value of its currency, the franc, against the euro, with nervous investors fleeing the market tumult and seeking the relative safety of Switzerland. But the euro’s decline has been particularly steep — and the rout may accelerate. The Swiss leaders’ abandonment of its target was taken as a bet that easier money from the European Central Bank is on the way, and potentially on a vast scale. The abrupt decision on Thursday sent the value of the Swiss franc soaring, as the country’s stocks broadly plummeted. The shares of exporters, in particular, got slammed over fears that the rising currency would weigh on profit. “Words fail me!” Nick Hayek, the chief executive of the Swiss watchmaker the Swatch Group, said in a statement distributed to news media, adding that today’s action “is a tsunami: for the export industry and for tourism, and finally for the entire country.” As it scrapped the cap, the Swiss central bank simultaneously cut interest rates, already in negative terrain, hoping to offset some of the damage in foreign exchange markets. It changed the rate on deposits to minus 0.75 percent from minus 0.25 percent, tripling what it costs lenders to park money at the central bank. But that was too little to stop the tide, and the franc jolted 15 percent higher against the euro. Swiss stocks plummeted in value as investors hastened to sell equities priced in francs. Euro-area stocks sharply higher at less competition from Swiss exports.Google will stop selling Glass to the general public - but Google says the device is not dead yet. (More coverage here) A report from the Wall Street Journal on Thursday said Google will stop selling Glass to the general public Jan. 19.  The company confirmed the report and said Google will still give Glass units to developers and companies who want to look at its applications for the office as part of Google's \"Glass at Work\" program, which has examined how the headset can help professionals such as doctors, emergency workers and filmmakers. On the consumer front, the company has been pretty quiet about Glass in recent months, a striking contrast to its splashy 2012 launch, when Google chief executive Sergey Brin unveiled the device by skydiving into the company's developers conference. At first it was only available to developers, dubbed \"Explorers\" by the company, who wanted to play around with the new technology. Over the next year, Google tried to make the device more marketable to the general public by introducing. high-fashion frames, sunglasses lenses and prescription lenses for Glass. But the idea of a face-worn computer still met with skepticism, ridicule and even hostility from the general public. It also drew several comparisons to notable tech flops such as the Segway as a product that started with a good idea but was ultimately too niche -- and, honestly, too nerdy -- to catch on outside a group of dedicated enthusiasts. Despite originally hinting that it would launch a consumer version of Glass by the end of 2014, Google never did -- though the company did eventually let anyone with $1,500 buy their own developer version.China's taxi app wars intensify: Alibaba-Backed Taxi App Said to Be Raising $500 Million: A taxi-booking service backed by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA), is raising more than $500 million to expand in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Hangzhou-based company will issue new shares and receive investment from Alibaba, SoftBank Corp. (9984) and Tiger Global Management LLC, the person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Kuaidi would be valued at more than $2 billion, the person said. Kuaidi competes with Uber Technologies Inc. and Didi Taxi, which is backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700), for the 500 million people in China using mobile phones to access the Internet for services and entertainment. Kuaidi prefers to pursue an initial public offering rather than be bought in a takeover, the company said in July. Kuaidi’s taxi booking app attracted 100 million users, who place about 3 million orders a day, according to an e-mailed statement from the company in July, which are the latest figures available. The service has more than 1 million drivers in about 300 cities. Kuaidi also introduced Yi Hao Zhuan Che, a luxury car-booking service, last year to compete with Uber. The San Francisco-based company’s valuation reached $40 billion in its latest fundraising round. Background: China’s taxi app market is dominated by two apps – Kuaidi Dache and Didi Dache. They both focus on regulated, licensed cabs, and so have avoided much of the legal issues that have beset Uber. In December last year, Didi Dache flagged down US$700 million in funding, making it the second highest funded taxi app in the world, netting more than Lyft, GrabTaxi and Ola. Tencent has put money into Didi Dache, turning taxi apps into a new frontier in the wide-scale battle between Alibaba and Tencent. Last summer Kuaidi Dache ventured into Uber’s area by launching a high-end on-demand car service called Kuaidi One. Kuaidi Dache now covers over 1 million taxis in more than 300 cities in China, including Hong Kong.Rumors swirl that Samsung will buy Blackberry for its patents; Blackberry stock surges, then falls on Samsung denial: Samsung Electronics recently offered to buy BlackBerry Ltd for as much as $7.5 billion, seeking its valuable patents as it battles Apple in the corporate market, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents seen by Reuters. Representatives from the two companies, which are working with advisers, met last week to discuss a potential transaction, the source said, asking not to be identified because the conversations are private. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company said in a statement that it \"has not engaged in discussions with Samsung with respect to any possible offer to purchase BlackBerry. Shares of BlackBerry, which soared nearly 30 percent following the Reuters report, fell back about 15 percent in after-hours electronic trading following the statement. Samsung also told Reuters in Seoul that it has no plans to acquire Blackberry. \"Media reports of the acquisition are groundless,\" a company spokeswoman said. BlackBerry, a one-time investor darling that pioneered smartphones, has regained some of its lost swagger under Chief Executive John Chen, who is leading a bid to regain market share it has lost to Apple Inc, Google Inc and Samsung. “To get a hold of the BlackBerry network and all its secure features, that would be a real coup for Samsung, looking to differentiate themselves from Apple and from others,\" he said. BlackBerry's patent portfolio is composed of roughly 44,000 patents, worth more than $1.43 billion in net book value as of August last year, although many analysts think they could be worth much more. Edward Snyder, managing director of Charter Equity Research, said it made sense for Samsung to target BlackBerry's patents in its outgoing battle with Apple and others, and that it likely would need to bid for the whole company because BlackBerry management did not want to only sell specific assets. \"Samsung will have to buy the whole thing and then and shutter what they don't need,” he said. In the third quarter, revenue at BlackBerry, which is increasingly focusing on providing services like secure corporate networks, fell to $793 million from $1.19 billion a year earlier, falling short of analysts' expectations of $931.5 million.Zomato is in talks to raise $100M: Zomato Media Pvt Ltd, the company behind the popular restaurant listing and review site Zomato.com, is in talks to raise $100 million (Rs 625 crore) in a fresh funding, says a Reuters report quoting its co-founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal. This comes close on the heels of Zomato sealing its sixth acquisition in as many months and its biggest yet of restaurant information and table booking property Urbanspoon in the US for $52 million (Rs 325 crore). In November last year, Zomato had raised $60 million in funding at a pre-money valuation of $600 million from existing investorsInvestors Put $186 Million Into Lynda.com, an Online Tutorial Service, as US education startups get hot: Investor confidence in the education technology sector suddenly looks a lot more serious — at least for digital learning companies with proven business models. Lynda.com, an online video tutorial service that provides professional skills training to individuals and enterprise clients, announced Wednesday morning that it had raised $186 million in financing. The round was led by TPG Capital, a private investment firm. The sum dwarfs the largest ed tech financing deal of last year; in that deal, Pluralsight, another online training platform for professional skill development, raised $135 million from venture capital and private equity firms. The amount raised by Lynda.com also represents the largest ed tech financing deal in the last six years, according to CB Insights, a venture capital database that has been tracking the sector since 2009. Industry analysts said the Lynda deal was notable for other reasons, too. “It’s interesting, for one thing, that the round was led by TPG, a private investor likely to do more research on the market and revenue model than an early-stage investor focused on growth,” said Matthew Wong, a research analyst at CB Insights. Founded in 1995 as a training program for web design, Lynda.com is hardly a start-up. The company currently offers 5,700 courses online in English and other languages for professionals in business subjects like management; technology skills like programming and web development; and creative fields like video and photography. Lynda.com generated more than $150 million in revenue in 2014, Mr. Robison said, and has been profitable since 1997. He added that the company planned to spend the capital it raised on acquiring firms that specialize in technical and business skills training for professionals; on expanding internationally; and on improving the product experience for subscribers.Indian capital market regulator Sebi is working on crowdfunding guidelines: SEBI is is holding consultations for “evolving guidelines” on crowd funding that will help start ups raise funds. Crowd-funding typically involves young entrepreneurs and small groups of people raising funds for their ventures through various online platforms involving individuals as well as organisations. Sebi whole-time member Rajeev Agarwal today said the regulator “was evolving guidelines in consultation with government for funding arrangements for star up entrepreneurs”. The market regulator had, in July last year, come out with draft norms on crowd funding. Under the proposed norms, the issuer entities and their promoters and directors would need to meet ‘fit and proper’ criteria of Sebi, while they can not use multiple platforms to raise such funds within a year, among others. According to Sebi, there is a need for funding for SME through alternative sources as 2008 global financial crisis made it difficult for banks to lend money to the ventures or start-ups, which may have high risk element. However, Sebi said there is possibility of systemic risk associated with crowd-funding as well as chances that investors could be defrauded.Instacart raises another $220M, valued at > $2B; Pinterest like UI, nimble org drive 10x growth in 2014: Instacart announced it had closed a $220 million round of venture capital from Silicon Valley investors like Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, among others. The new round brings the total amount of funding raised to $275 million, and values the company at a whopping $2 billion, according to two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of continuing ties to the company. It is an ambitious bet on the future of how we think about grocery shopping and delivery services. The company, which was founded in 2012, allows customers to peruse the online catalogs of their favorite grocery stores — like Whole Foods, a major Instacart partner — and schedule deliveries directly to their homes. The user interface is akin to other consumer tech start-ups, like Pinterest, and lays out everyday grocery items in a simple-to-browse grid. Instacart is currently available in 15 American cities. The concept is not entirely new. Competitors like Fresh Direct, which operates primarily in New York, have offered local grocery delivery services for more than a decade. And even larger technology giants like Google, eBay and Amazon — companies with much more money and vastly greater resources than Instacart — have tried to play in the space with their own same-day delivery services. Apoorva Mehta, Instacart’s chief executive, said his company’s size and structure is why it is likely to succeed. “We have the ability to try new things in a very quick way,” Mr. Mehta said in an interview. “We don’t hold inventory, we don’t own warehouses, we don’t own trucks. The changes we make are software changes.” That, Mr. Mehta said, is in stark contrast to companies like Google and eBay, which are much larger and offer a wider range of delivery items. Ebay Now, eBay’s same-day service, touts its ability to deliver anything from big-screen TVs to hammers and nails from companies like Best Buy and Home Depot. He said Instacart’s focus on one particular type of product, groceries, allows the company to be more nimble than its competitors. The proof, Mr. Mehta said, is in the growth numbers. Instacart would not provide specific financial information, but it said that its revenues grew by more than a factor of 10 in 2014, and doubled in the final quarter of last year alone. While the company employs only around 100 employees, it has more than 4,000 contract employees who do its shopping and delivery.IBM Introduces z13, a mainframe with potential eCommerce applications: more coverage here IBM has designed the latest version of the mainframe, which is being introduced on Wednesday, with the smartphone in mind. The new mainframe, the z13, has been engineered to cope with the huge volume of data and transactions generated by people using smartphones and tablets. IBM spent $1 billion to develop the z13, and that research generated 500 new patents, including some for encryption intended to improve the security of mobile computing. Much of the new technology, Mr. Rosamilia said, is designed for real-time analysis in business. For example, he said, the mainframe system can allow automated fraud prevention while a purchase is being made on a smartphone. Another example, he said, would be providing shoppers with personalized offers while they are in a store, by tracking their locations and tapping data on their preferences, mainly from their previous buying patterns at that retailer. These real-time applications, according to Donna Dillenberger, a distinguished engineer at IBM’s Watson lab, can be done in a mainframe environment. They are not yet possible on clusters of smaller, industry-standard computers, she said. But there are several open-source software projects, like Apache Spark, that focus on real-time data processing across large numbers of computers.TechCrunch reports:  IBM claims this machine has the ability to process 2.5B transactions per day, the equivalent of 100 Cyber Mondays every single day, or so they say. Mike Gilfix, who is director of enterprise mobile at IBM said with its latest model, the company paid particularly close attention to the growing complexity around mobile transactions and designed the system to handle the intricate interplay between systems, while maintaining security with what they are calling “real-time mobile encryption,” and providing high-end analytics on the fly. As an example, he talked about a single eCommerce transaction on a mobile device. When we touch Buy, he explained, it requires a bunch of different systems to communicate including credit card transactions, inventory control and shipping — and they all have to work in tandem. He said when you extrapolate that out into billions of transactions moving across conventional networks, the power of the z13 can eliminate much of the lag. Gilfix suggested that the majority of sales would probably come from existing customers in finance, large retail customers and healthcare, and others who have a large investment in data stored on mainframes already. Still, the company is hoping that the mobile nature of this system will attract buyers who might not have considered a mainframe in the past. One scenario Gilfix suggested is using the z13 as a private cloud and running OpenStack on it, which is certainly an interesting idea.Alibaba buys controlling stake in digital marketing firm AdChina: China's e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said on Wednesday it had bought a controlling stake in online marketing company AdChina, an investment aimed at bolstering its advertising business. Alibaba did not close the size of the deal or the stake it would take in AdChina, a Shanghai-based firm founded in 2007. The internet marketing firm, which generated $51 million in sales in 2011, had filed for a $100 million initial public offering in Feb. 2012, but pulled the listing a year later. The deal is the first Alibaba has disclosed this year, after spending more than $6.2 billion on acquisitions in 2014, the same year as its record-setting $25 billion New York listing. The AdChina investment is geared towards improving Alibaba's online and mobile advertising efforts through Alimama, the group's advertising arm. This unit sells marketing to merchants using Alibaba's e-commerce sites like online marketplace Taobao and online retail platform Tmall.com.GoPro plunges on Apple patent win: GoPro shares plummeted 12 percent, their steepest decline since August, after Apple  was granted a patent for a remote-control camera system. The stock dropped to $49.87 at the close in New York. The plunge followed Apple gaining a patent today from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a system that lets consumers control a digital camera remotely. Investors are concerned that the patent will let Apple, the world’s largest company by market valuation, make products that are similar to what GoPro offers, said Charlie Anderson, an analyst at Dougherty & Co. Apple sold more than 270 million units of its various products in fiscal 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. GoPro, which went public in June and is trading at more than twice its initial public offering price of $24 a share, has been volatile in recent months. The world’s biggest maker of wearable cameras used by surfers and sports enthusiasts to record their exploits is facing questions about its ability to create a media business around the videos that consumers post online using their GoPro devices. About half of the company’s outstanding shares will also become available on the market on Feb. 17 when a lock-up lifts on employees and other insiders’ shares, Anderson said.France’s BlaBlaCar comes to India with ride-sharing between cities; its first expansion outside Europe:  While taxi apps like Uber and Ola find themselves in a regulatory quagmire in Indian cities, a new car pooling service has just come in for rides from one city to another. France-based BlaBlaCar launched in India today, its first stop in Asia. This follows the arrival late last year of Tripda from Brazil, another ride-sharing marketplace. “India, with its young, highly connected population, and multiple major urban hubs separated by long distances, has great potential for ridesharing. Chronically overcrowded transport infrastructure forces travellers to book their train or bus tickets weeks in advance, while the high price of fuel makes long-distance car travel often unaffordable. BlaBlaCar will make last-minute city-to-city travel both available and affordable. Car-owners will be able to offer seats to co-travelers, so they can travel together and share fuel costs,” says Nicholas Brusson, co-founder of BlaBlaCar. BlaBlaCar connect drivers who have empty seats in their cars for a long distance ride with co-travellers. The charge for the co-traveller is limited to sharing the fuel and running costs; so it’s not meant to be a profit-making avenue for drivers. The company usually takes a 10 percent cut from what the co-traveller pays or driver receives. BlaBlaCar had a US$100 million funding round last year, and operates in 13 countries in Europe. India is its first market outside Europe. BlaBlaCar will initially operate out of Delhi and its satellite town of Gurgaon, connecting cities in north India. Delhi is where Uber got into trouble last month after the arrest of a driver for raping a young woman, and still faces a ban as regulators insist on compliance with their rules. Car pooling services like BlaBlaCar, however, have yet to come under that kind of scrutiny. BlaBlaCar’s co-founder makes a distinction between a marketplace model and a taxi app. “At Uber, you don’t choose your driver,” says Brusson. “At Blablacar, there’s a two-way community where you need acceptance from both sides.”App Annie raises $55M in series D: App Annie, an app analytics service for developers, revealed today that it has secured US$55 million in series D funding. The investment eclipses the previous US$17 million round in May 2014, which was accompanied by news that it had acquired competitor Distimo for an undisclosed sum. App Annie’s newest input comes from Institutional Venture Partners (IVP), with participation from existing investors Sequoia Capital, Greycroft Partners, and IDG Capital Partners. App Annie claims it doubled its team to 300 employees in 2014 and tripled its revenues.Flipkart reports some marketplace stats:  Flipkart today said it aims to help over 10,000 sellers generate business worth Rs 10 lakh through its platform this year. “In 2014, Flipkart helped over 2,000 sellers become millionaires through Flipkart sales. December 2014 alone saw over 500 sellers doing an average business of Rs 10 lakh each, while 50 sellers did an average of Rs 1 crore each,” Flipkart said in a statement. With a year on year growth of close to 30 per cent, apparels and consumer electronics categories have the most number of sellers who have crossed the millionaire mark followed by sellers of home decor, jewellery, handicrafts and large appliances. Nearly 60 per cent of millionaire sellers came from metros (Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore) and the rest from the non-metros, it said. “2015 projections estimate that the numbers from the latter will double,” the statement added.Indian startup action#1: Mobile internet firm One97 Communications raises $575M from Alibaba, valued at $2B: On97, seeking funds to boost its flagship m-com and virtual wallet property Paytm, is raising $575 million from the world’s largest e-com firm Alibaba and the group’s separate payment unit Alipay. This is in addition to $60 million more from existing lead investor SAIF Partners, sources close to the development told Techcircle.in. The deal would value One97 at around $1.5 billion pre-money or just over $2 billion, post-money. This would make it the second most valued internet related firm in India, behind Flipkart. For Alibaba, this would be the first significant strategic move in the country and its biggest bet since last September when it saw through its mega $25 billion public float on NYSE, the world’s largest ever. Founded in 2000, One97 Communications is a leading mobile-internet company in India that offers digital goods & services to its mobile consumers under the Paytm brand. It also provides mobile advertising, marketing and payments for merchants. In addition, it has a partnership with existing lead investor SAIF Partners where it invests in early stage mobile internet startups through One97 Mobility Fund. Meanwhile, One97 has also applied for a ‘payments banking’ licence and part of the funds raised would be used to double its reach in India with investments in technology and customer acquisition.Indian startup action #2: Zomato enters US with purchase of Urbanspoon for around $40-50M, aims at Yelp: Zomato.com has struck its sixth overseas acquisition in as many months and its biggest yet by acquiring Urbanspoon, a restaurant information and table booking property, the company’s co-founder and chief Deepinder Goyal said in a blog post. The transaction value stands undisclosed but is pegged at around $40-50 million. Goyal said in his blog post that the firm spent most of its last round of funding on this acquisition. In November, Zomato had raised $60 million in a fresh round of funding at a pre-money valuation of $600 million from existing investors Info Edge (India) and Sequoia while adding Vy Capital as a new investor. Urbanspoon, which was part of NASDAQ-listed umbrella firm for various internet ventures IAC, has a presence in six countries including US, Canada, Ireland, UK, Australia and New Zealand. It was a self funded venture before IAC snapped the firm in 2009. It has 80 million+ visit a month as against 35 million+ of Zomato; presence in over 500 cities as against 150 million+ for Zomato with over 1 million restaurant listings, over 1.4 million reviewers and around nine times the number of ratings compared to Zomato. The acquisition would make the first big move by an Indian internet venture in the US. Zomato’s approach of hiring people to curate and constantly update restaurant listings and menus will present a challenge to Yelp and Foursquare, which rely more on user-generated reviews. This involves a lot of legwork but pays off for Zomato as users are less likely to encounter an outdated menu or a restaurant that has no resemblance to its review.JD.com makes an eCommerce platform play as Chinese eCommerce goes niche:  \"JD.com is trying to position itself as the go-to e-commerce platform, and this could be an important category expansion for them,\" said John Choi, a Hong Kong-based Internet analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets. China's JD.com Inc has ratcheted up competition with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd through a $1.55 billion deal with an online car sales portal, as the e-commerce giants gun for high-value markets like cars, tourism and homes. Following over a year of fervent investment activity in China's tech sector, niche e-commerce markets are now in vogue as targets, analysts say. Taking stakes in specialists like Bitauto Holdings Ltd offers an avenue into big-ticket purchases which fall outside major e-commerce companies' traditional focus of day-to-day goods. Such tie-ups also lend smaller firms some of their bigger peers' clout, directing potential customers their way from websites like those of JD.com and Alibaba.  JD.com's deal late last week was the company's biggest ever, with its share of the investment in Bitauto valued at $1.35 billion. Chinese social networking and video game giant Tencent Holdings Ltd, which owns 17.6 percent of JD.com, will also take a 3.3 percent stake in Bitauto. Beijing-based JD.com will take 25 percent of Bitauto, giving China's second-biggest e-commerce player a foothold in auto sales. Bitauto will in turn benefit from JD.com's much larger audience and brand recognition, as the online retailer drives traffic to the car sales specialist. Other specialist areas attracting players like JD.com, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu Inc include tourism and pharmaceuticals. Last month, JD.com and investment firm Hony Capital led a $148 million round of funding in travel company Tuniu Corp. Alibaba invested 2.81 billion yuan ($454 million) in a hospitality technology provider in September to help the e-commerce firm develop its own travel business. Last week, JD.com Chief Executive Richard Liu in a press release on the Bitauto deal signaled that investments in specialist commerce companies would continue for some time.Before Xiaomi's latest fund-raise, Facebook, Xiaomi had talked, but their deal fell through on political concerns: Mark Zuckerberg and Xiaomi Inc CEO Lei Jun discussed a potential investment by Facebook in China's top smartphone maker ahead of its $1.1 billion fundraising last month, but a deal never materialized, several people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The discussions, at a private dinner when Zuckerberg visited Beijing in October, were never formalized, three of those people said, as the two CEOs weighed the political and commercial implications of Facebook - which has been banned in China since 2009 - buying into the Chinese tech star now valued at $45 billion. One individual with direct knowledge of Xiaomi's fundraising said the mooted Facebook investment was \"not huge,\" but the talks underscore how ties between U.S. and Chinese companies have deepened as China's tech industry matures. Xiaomi's Lei was partly put off by the potential for political fallout at home of selling a stake to Facebook while the U.S. social network is still banned in China, two of the people said, adding Xiaomi also feared a tie-up with Facebook could threaten its relationship with Google Inc, a crucial business partner. Xiaomi's phones are built on Google's Android operating system. Xiaomi ultimately announced last month it raised $1.1 billion from investors including Hong Kong-based tech fund All Stars Investment; DST Global, a private equity firm that has invested in Facebook and Alibaba Group; Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC; Chinese fund Hopu Management; and Alibaba founder Jack Ma's Yunfeng Capital. The fundraising valued Beijing-based Xiaomi at $45 billion just three years after it sold its first smartphone. The company had revenue of close to $12 billion in 2014.Code containers - popularized by Docker - win following at Google, Goldman, IBM, Microsoft: A tech start-up called DotCloud was on its last legs in 2012. Now called Docker, its software has been downloaded 70 million times. Docker is at the forefront of a new way to create software, called containers. These software containers are frequently compared with shipping containers. And as their popularity grows, building big computer networks could become remarkably simpler. Like the big metal containers that can move from ship to ship to truck without being opened, software containers ship applications across different “cloud computing” systems and make it easy to tinker with one part, like the products for sale on a mobile application, without worrying about the effect on another part, like the big database at the heart of the corporate network. “It absolutely makes it easier to write applications,” said Eric Brewer, Google’s vice president for computer infrastructure. Google developed the first type of container, for internal use, about eight years ago, which helped it build its Internet services quickly. Docker took the Google innovation and made it easy for people to use across computers. “It’s a huge efficiency gain in how you write code,” said Mr. Golub, who started his career teaching business courses in Uzbekistan. “You don’t have to rewrite everything, then fix all the breaks when it goes into production. You just work on what you change.” Goldman Sachs uses Docker to build and deploy the software it runs internally. “Our underlying software was getting so spread out” that it was difficult to manage, said Don Duet, a global co-head of technology at Goldman. “Docker is a central place where you can put everything.” A 26-year technology veteran, he compares software containers in importance to Java, a programming language created in the 1990s that led to rapid growth of the commercial Internet. At least for now, Docker’s small size and independence may be assets, since it is able to play with the giants without seeming like a threat. Microsoft in October announced it would work with Docker to put its Windows operating system in containers (Docker already works with several types of Linux, the operating system commonly used in the servers of many big clouds). IBM is working with Docker to increase the international deployment of containers. And Google and Amazon have both endorsed Docker at their events for software developers.Education start-ups might finally have their moment in the sun: The education technology business is chock-full of fledgling companies whose innovative ideas have not yet proved effective — or profitable. But that is not slowing investors, who are pouring money into ventures as diverse as free classroom-management apps for teachers and foreign language lessons for adult learners. Venture and equity financing for ed tech companies soared to nearly $1.87 billion last year, up 55 percent from the year before, according to a new report from CB Insights, a venture capital database. The figures are the highest since CB Insights began covering the industry in 2009. Notable financing deals include Pluralsight, a company that provides online training to technology professionals, which raised $135 million; Remind, a free messaging service for teachers to communicate with students and parents, which raised $40 million from venture capital firms including Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers; and Edmodo, an online social network customized for classroom use that is free to individual teachers, which raised $30 million. Education is one of the last industries to be touched by Internet technology, and we’re seeing a lot of catch-up going on,” said Betsy Corcoran, the chief executive of EdSurge, an industry news service and research company. “We’re starting to see more classical investors — the Kleiner Perkinses, the Andreessen Horowitzes, the Sequoias — pay more attention to the marketplace than before.” The smaller sums going into ed tech illustrate the challenges facing start-ups as they try to persuade public school systems to adopt their novel products. Companies often must navigate local school districts with limited budgets and slow procurement processes. To bypass the bureaucracy, many start-ups are marketing free learning apps and websites directly to teachers in the hopes that their schools might eventually buy enhanced services. Still, it is too early to tell whether that direct-to-consumer “freemium” strategy, as it is often called, will pan out for education software. “There are still a lot of questions around some companies’ business models in the sector,” said Matthew Wong, a research analyst at CB Insights. “One of the questions, because the product is free, is: ‘How are you going to monetize those users?’ ” One example is Remind, a popular messaging app that teachers use to send homework reminders to students and share classroom news with parents. Sports team coaches also use the system to send weather updates and schedule changes to their athletes. Word of mouth has propelled Remind from an unknown brand to a nationwide phenomenon. JD.com and Tencent back the same horse - to invest $1.55 billion in Chinese auto e-commerce site Bitauto:  Chinese auto information website operator Bitauto Holdings Ltd said JD.com Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd would invest about $1.3 billion in the company, sending its shares sharply higher in early trading on Friday. E-commerce company JD.com and Tencent, best known for its communications app WeChat, will also invest a total of $250 million in Bitauto unit YiXin Capital Ltd. JD.com, China's No. 2 e-commerce company after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, will invest $400 million in cash and about $750 million in resources to Bitauto, whose sites offer sales data and other information on new and used vehicles as well as customer reviews. Tencent will pay $150 million for its shares.Offline retailers bet on smart in-store tech: Neiman Marcus is reinventing the mirror: The retailer announced Thursday that it has installed a MemoryMirror from MemoMi in its Walnut Creek, Calif. store. It plans to install two in its San Francisco store later this month and then two in Dallas. The mirror* allows for shoppers to compare in real time how different outfits look on them. After trying on clothes in the fitting room, a customer can head to the sales floor where the special “mirror” is located. A customer controls the mirror with an iPad, instructing it when to start recording or take photos. Then he or she can try on additional outfits, and compare video footage. Two outfits can be looked at side-by-side, and the mirror stores as many clips as the customer wants. So a customer could try on a dozen looks, take videos of each, and quickly compare how each look. There’s also the option to e-mail videos or photos to friends for their input, or share on social media. The MemoryMirror isn’t technically a mirror, but a 70-inch screen with a camera on top that films the consumer. MemoMi founder Salvador Nissi Vilcovsky says the secret sauce is its perspective distortion correction, which automatically sizes  the mirror to fit the customer. So no matter if you’re standing four feet in front of it or 10 feet away, it proportions the mirror so the customer fills the shot. “The world is going in the direction of in-store devices and personalization. We want to make these devices as cheap as possible and give these services not only for luxury brands,” said Vilcovsky. Nordstrom and Rebecca Minkoff have also dabbled in the smart fitting room space, using eBay technology. MemoMi is working on adding features to its MemoryMirror that allow a customer to see how they look in different colors or patterns of the clothes they’re trying on. Vilcovsky also envisions one day technology such as this being available on consumers’ televisions.Box is finally close to $162M IPO, valulation likely lower than last round of funding: After months of delay, Box is finally close to making its stock market debut. Box, the online data storage provider, disclosed on Friday that it was seeking to raise up to $162.5 million in its initial public offering, as the company embarked on a road show for potential investors. (If demand proved high, the company could sell additional shares and raise up to $186.9 million.) In an amended prospectus, Box said that it planned to price its shares at $11 to $13 a share. At the midpoint of that range, the company would be valued at about $1.4 billion — less than the valuation the company fetched in a private $150 million fund-raising round last summer. Founded in 2005, Box became one of the most prominent independent providers of online storage and file sharing services, particularly for corporations. But the company has been somewhat overshadowed by the much bigger Dropbox, a member of the 11-digit club of start-ups with a $10 billion or more valuation, and rival file-sharing offerings from technology juggernauts like Google. According to its prospectus, Box still hasn’t turned a profit. It lost $121.5 million in the nine months ended Oct. 31, a slight narrowing from the same time in the previous year. Sales, however, jumped 80 percent during that same period, to $153.8 million. And Box has asserted that it has won clients like General Electric, DirecTV and AstraZeneca. The company first filed to go public last spring, but put off its I.P.O. plans as a sudden investor distaste for risky technology companies rippled through the markets. Since then, the start-up has waited for a more propitious time to make its stock market debut. Bankers and companies are betting that time is now. Last month, a number of technology start-ups, ranging from the peer-to-peer lending juggernaut Lending Club to the data analysis provider New Relic, enjoyed strong trading debuts. The company is expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “BOX.”Cash collection can make the difference between life and death for a Saas business: how does one achieve rapid growth in a SaaS business while maintaining capital efficiency? By focusing on the timing of cash collection, not just cash spend. The timing of cash collection can drastically influence the cash consumption of a high-growth, recurring-revenue business significantly beyond what one would intuitively assume. This ultimately has implications on the attractiveness of a business or, at a minimum, the level of shareholder dilution it experiences over time and will become an increasing area of focus as the period of cheap growth capital slowly comes to an end. Let’s take two hypothetical early-to-mid stage, high-growth, recurring-revenue SaaS businesses and model them over a five-year period. We assume each company admirably grows annual GAAP revenue from $2M-$6M-$13M-$28M-$53M and enjoys a 100 percent annual renewal rate. Both companies have identical aggregate cost structures that are well over 100 percent of revenue, which is benchmarked on dozens of recent high-growth SaaS businesses we’ve evaluated or invested in, or that have gone public. As illustrated below, the two companies thus have identical GAAP bookings, revenues and operating income. The only difference is that the first company, Company M (“monthly”), is like most SaaS companies in that it gets paid cash monthly and ratably over the one year contract period. The second company, Company A (“advance”), collects the full annual contracted value in advance. The difference in cash consumption between the two companies is staggering. Company A would have burned $36 million less cash over the five-year period due to growing deferred revenue balances, to achieve the exact same revenue and bookings trajectory as Company M. This gap in cash consumption can be the difference between success and bankruptcy or moderate versus significant dilution for the founders and early investors. Company M burned more than three times the amount of capital as compared to Company A despite identical bookings, revenue growth and operating expenses. Who can afford to ignore this?CommonFloor raises funding from Google Capital; prospect of lower interest rates propeling India Real Estate Tech: CommonFloor.com, has raised an undisclosed amount in funding from Google Capital, the corporate venture capital arm of tech giant Google Inc. The fresh funding comes just three months after the firm grabbed $30 million (Rs 181 crore) in Series E round of funding from existing investor Tiger Global Management. This is Google Capital’s second investment in India following its investment in SaaS-based customer support solutions startup Freshdesk Inc in mid-2014 and the third ever in Asia. So far, since its launch in the summer of 2013, Google Capital has made just ten bets, seven of them in the US. The only ones outside America are Chinese optical components maker Innolight, India’s cloud-based customer support software maker Freshdesk, which is headquartered in San Francisco, and now CommonFloor. A lowering of home loan rates, a relaxation of FDI (foreign direct investment) in construction, and an improvement in business sentiment after a new government took over in India last year have given the real estate sector a boost.Activist investor urges Yahoo to dispose Alibaba stake in a tax-efficient manner and return money to shareholders - CEO Mayer seeks to spend and expand instead: In the letter, addressed to Mayer from Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith, the investor said it had become “increasingly concerned” by reports that the Web portal is looking to make major acquisitions. He reiterated that Yahoo should unlock value by monetizing assets -- which include stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan Corp. -- trimming costs and exploring a combination with AOL Inc. Starboard owned less than 1 percent of Yahoo, or about 7.7 million shares, as of September 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Yahoo’s performance has been increasingly in the spotlight since the initial public offering of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba in September. Yahoo owned about a 24 percent piece of Alibaba, which had driven much of the Silicon Valley company’s value. Yahoo reaped a one-time boost of more than $9 billion before taxes from selling some Alibaba shares in the IPO and still retains a valuable stake of about 15 percent of the Chinese company. How Yahoo treats that stake has become a major debate, with options including a cash-rich split-off and a tax-efficient spinoff, among others. Starboard expressed “concerns” that Yahoo has made no announcement for a tax-efficient separation of the equity assets and criticized the possibility of a cash-rich split-off structure for those assets as unnecessarily complex. Starboard has spoken with large Yahoo shareholders, who also prefer a tax-efficient spinoff over a cash-rich split-off. In addition, he said Yahoo “must significantly reduce costs to improve profitability in its core business and should be considering a combination with AOL.” “Starboard has a point,” said Brett Harriss, an analyst at Gabelli & Co., who has a buy rating on Yahoo. “There are a lot of acquisitions that haven’t generated any financial returns.” He added that there’s a concern that Mayer is “not a steward of shareholder capital.”Bad news for Google #1: US Search Marketshare at lowest level in years on Firefox's switch to Yahoo: Google dominance of the U.S. Internet search market slipped last month in the biggest drop since 2009 while Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) posted its largest share gain, as the companies grappled with the fallout of a search deal on Firefox browsers. Google’s slice of the U.S. search market fell to 75.2 percent in December from 79.3 percent a year ago, while Yahoo jumped to 10.4 percent from 7.4 percent, according to analytics firm StatCounter. That put Google at its smallest share of the U.S. Web search market since at least 2008, when StatCounter first started tracking the numbers, and the highest share for Yahoo since 2009. The changes were spurred by a deal in November where Yahoo replaced Google as the default search engine on Firefox browers in the U.S. Google had been the automatic search option for Firefox, which was developed by Mountain View, California-based Mozilla Corp., since 2004. CES loses its lustre - as smartphones lead, consumer electronics follow: “Today, what every customer expects is for their device to be a platform”: Technology fanatics descend every January on Las Vegas for the International CES, a colossal gathering of gadgetry and geekery where some of the world’s largest companies show off their best ideas for the future. This year, as in every recent year, the show has been burdened by existential angst, with many tech writers saying they planned to skip an event no longer seen as vital. It has been ages since anything momentous was unveiled at CES. But the travails of CES are a symptom of a larger transformation in tech. The era dominated by consumer electronics — what most of us call gadgets — is in turmoil. One reason is that many devices have been superseded by a single, all-powerful tool: the smartphone. Today, just about everything that once required a small, dedicated electronic device — from cameras to portable game consoles to GPS navigators to music players to too many others to name — works better as an app on a phone. At the same time, smartphones have created new categories of capabilities that have eclipsed gadgets as the tech industry’s center of energy and innovation. Photo apps like Instagram, messaging companies like WhatsApp and Snapchat, transportation systems like Uber and Lyft, and Apple Pay, the wireless payment system created by a company best known for its hardware. These services, powered by smart software, use our phones’ constant connection to the cloud, and their powers to connect us with one another, to create tech experiences that wouldn’t have been possible with the gadgets of yesteryear. None of them would ever have graced a stage at CES, because none of these things are really gadgets; they’re way more exciting than that. Here’s the important lesson for consumer electronics companies: The future of tech may not be in flashier, more powerful hardware, but instead in services enabled by clever software. The gadgets matter, but only if they allow for software that can create useful, perhaps groundbreaking services that work across all our gadgets. “Today, what every customer expects is for their device to be a platform,”Glassdoor raises $70M, valuation ~ $1B, preps for IPO: Glassdoor Inc, the operator of jobs website Glassdoor.com, said it raised $70 million from Google Capital and existing investors Tiger Global, Battery Ventures and Sutter Hill Ventures. Glassdoor, whose rivals include Monster Worldwide Inc, said it had raised about $160 million so far. Glassdoor has a valuation of close to $1 billion and is planning for an initial public offering, the Wall Street Journal said.  Glassdoor said it had more than 27 million registered members worldwide. The company has over 2,000 employer clients including Groupon Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Facebook Inc, Chevron Corp, Procter & Gamble Co and Twitter Inc. Glassdoor raised $50 million in December 2013 from a group led by Tiger Global.Payments story #2: Rocket ties up with Philippines telco for payments solution in SE Asia: Ecommerce giant Rocket Internet and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) today took a big step towards their goal of becoming a strong contender in online payments in the region. In a joint statement, the companies announced they’ve inked an agreement to form a 50-50 joint venture for online and mobile payment solutions, with a focus on emerging markets. This follows PLDT’s US$445 million investment in the Germany-based startup incubator. The joint venture particularly targets Rocket Internet’s ecommerce operations under brands such as Zalora and Lazada in Southeast Asia. Prior to this deal, the companies had begun making use of PLDT’s MePay. MePay is a payment service for shopping on Zalora’s site without a credit card.Big news in the US TV Market: Dish to launch Sling TV, a web TV service: What is Sling TV? Sling TV is a service by Dish Network, one of the country's largest satellite TV providers. When it officially goes online in a few weeks, it will cost $20 a month. For that you'll get access to about 30 channels — including TNT, Cartoon Network and CNN. These channels will be streamable over the Internet — or \"over the top,\" in industry parlance. But the real kicker is that Dish is throwing in ESPN (more on that in a second). Why is Dish launching something like this? Dish wants to go after cord-cutters — a growing segment of TV watchers who don't subscribe to pay-TV and instead watch only free, over-the-air television, on-demand services like Netflix, or a mix of both. The drawback to being a cord-cutter is that you sometimes sacrifice channel choices. You don't get to watch HBO, for example, if you're a cord-cutter. But many people, particularly young viewers, don't seem to mind — and that's a problem for traditional pay-TV companies. What's the big deal about ESPN? Live sports is pretty much the foundation for all paid television. Snapdeal invests in comparison site Smartprix - follows investments in recommendation engine Wishpicker, discovery platform Doozton: Snapdeal, has quietly picked a stake in Smartprix Web Private Limited, which runs online product and price comparison site Smartprix, sources privy to the development told Techcircle.in. This comes as yet another strategic move for Snapdeal in acquiring or getting an exposure to third-party e-commerce enabling ventures over the last year or so. It had recently acquired gifting recommendation venture Wishpicker besides snapping fashion products discovery platform Doozton around a year ago. It is learnt that Snapdeal had initially acquired 10 per cent stake in Smartprix in FY14 with the understanding to acquire a majority stake eventually. “Snapdeal’s VP engineering Amitabh Misra had joined the board of Smartprix as one of the directors,” said one of the sources. Smartprix was founded in May 2011 by then IIT-Delhi students Choudhary and Khandelwal who have dual degree in computer science and engineering. Smartprix.com is an online comparison shopping that helps users compare different products and choose the best product according to their needs. It also presents the pricing information of the product on different online stores and provides review, ranking and recommendations. Its product categories include mobile phones, tablets, laptops, cameras personal care appliances, accessories and books. The firm also features deals on all kinds of products and plans to introduce newer categories. The firm earns commission from the affiliates for every sale. To date, it has tied up with over 50 online stores. Snapdeal is not the first firm to eye a piece of a product price comparison engine. Amazon already runs a India specific price comparison site called Junglee.com  There are several startups in the price comparison space, many of whom have managed to grab VC attention. Among these, Zopper.com raised $5 million led by Tiger Global Management LLC, PriceBag.com raised $2 million from angel investors, MySmartPrice raised $1 million from Accel and Helion, YouTellMe.com recently raised $100,000 from Dutch early-stage fund Bright Ventures, among others.Why did Amazon send 405 reps to CES 2014? Why did Apple send just 4? The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is one of largest trade shows around: Amazon.com, the third-biggest consumer-electronics retailer in the U.S., sent 405 representatives to CES 2014. Apple, the fourth-biggest, sent four, according to the Consumer Electronics Association, which puts on the conference.Back in 2009, when Amazon was only eighth among U.S. electronics retailers, it sent 69 reps to the annual nerd festival. Apple, then the third-largest electronics retailer, also sent 69 that year. Apple hasn’t introduced a product at the dog and pony show in more than a decade—after debuting a series of flops there in the 1990s, including a video-game console and the Newton—but it had steadily increased its number of reps at CES from 2009 to 2011 as the company grew its retail operations. While Apple Stores mostly sell the company’s brand-name products, it does carry accessories from other hardware makers. U.S. electronics sales at Apple Stores last year rose to more than $11 billion, according to the Consumer Electronics Association. But for some reason, Apple cut its badge count to four in 2012, where it’s remained ever since. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Amazon, which also didn’t respond to a request for comment, sent more employees last year than Best Buy and Wal-Mart Stores, the top two gadget retailers. Amazon sells its own products, too, but it’s a retailer first and foremost. If CES’s influence in waning, nobody told Jeff Bezos.Separately, Xiaomi announces the Redmi 2, an improved version of its sub-$150 smartphone: The company’s flagship Mi devices may attract all the attention, but the sub-$150 Redmi family is its biggest seller. Back in July of last year, Xiaomi revealed it had sold 18 million Redmi (/Hongmi as it is known in China) phones and 3.56 million Redmi Note phablets. The Redmi alone accounted for one-third of total sales at the time. The Redmi 2 keeps much of the original model’s ingredients. It has the same 4.7-inch, 1280 x 720 display, but under the hood there’s an upgraded 64-bit Qualcomm 410 quad-core processor. The device sports an 8-megapixel rear camera, improved 2-megapixel front camera, 1GB RAM and 8GB on-device storage. There is now dual 4G SIM support too. The Redmi 2 — which runs Xiaomi’s own MIUI version of Android — also gives a few more options for color-loving customers. ‘Lime green’ and ‘powder yellow’ are the new additions to the palette. The phone will cost 699 CNY, which is around $112, when it goes on sale on January 9. There’s no word on when it will be released outside of China, but you can be sure that the Redmi 2 will make its way to India, Indonesia and Xiaomi’s other overseas markets soon.IBM's stock is in a funk, and analysts call for the firm to invest in R&D rather than do share buy-backs: IBM requires an atypical activist fix. The company’s strategy of cost cuts and debt-fueled buybacks is no longer working – even though the company keeps trying. A tarnished balance sheet, lean staffing and a history of disposals rule out typical activist wheezes. Encouraging Virginia M. Rometty, the chairwoman and chief executive, to invest in IBM’s core businesses could pay off. IBM has run the same playbook for two decades. It sells low-margin businesses, cuts expenses, buys some profitable software companies and returns a lot of cash to investors. Over the last four quarters, the $152 billion company has spent more than $23 billion on dividends and buybacks. The problem is that IBM is investing too little. It has spent only about $11 billion over the last four quarters in total on research and development, capital expenditure and acquisitions. That’s a problem in technology, where old products soon become obsolete. Google spends about 16 percent of its sales on R.&D., but IBM spends 6 percent. The effect is becoming clear on the top line. Revenue has shrunk for 10 consecutive quarters. Costs have been cut to the bone, sending customers fleeing to better service providers. In a good year for stocks, IBM’s shares have fallen more than 15 percent. That means IBM has overpaid on its last three years of buybacks.Big data firms are starting to focus on 'unstructured data' that resides in presentations, memos and reports: data analysis is great if your information is in formats that are easy for computers to read, such as spreadsheets with numbers, or responses on a scale from one to five. But a lot of information isn't organized like that. Instead, it's in presentations, memos, reports, comments or just plain e-mail. Analysis of that kind of information -- often called \"unstructured\" or \"dark\" data -- is really tough to do by computer, and companies including Intel, SAP and HP are looking for a more reliable way to do it. Another firm, uReveal, thinks that it's cracked the code. Charles \"Bucky\" Clarkson, uReveal's chairman and CEO, said that software such as his makes it easier to to parse all those government reports and organize the data so that analysts can get more out of it, and more quickly. He also claims that the software is so simple to use that (gasp!) even liberal arts majors can use it.Tech patents are increasingly in the news: Story #1: Priceline.com's founder attempts a marketplace for tech patents, and China announces plans to triple the number of patents filed by 2020: In 1997, Jay Walker founded Priceline.com — the Web site many people use to get cheaper airfare by \"naming your own price.\" Patenting the solution, and allowing others to use the patents for a fee, helped drive Walker's success. But, Walker argues in an interview, many patents remain underused. Now, the man who smoothed transactions for buyers and sellers of airplane tickets wants to do something similar for a key part of the nation's information economy. Walker is developing something called the United States Patent Utility.  \"We're going to form a utility, which works as a neutral party for both inventors of technology and users of technology. So you would be listing your patents as available for use. Then the next thing we're going to do is, we're going to say to people who are small to medium sized companies, get on the phone with us and talk to us for about 10 or 15, 20 minutes and tell us about your products and services. Send us PDFs of your sales manuals, your technical literature we can ingest, and we'll build a model of the technologies and products you use. If you're a shoe manufacturer, we can take all your specifications, all your sales materials, and we can read it all into the system. And then what we do is use a set of Big Data algorithms to take your specifications of all your products and services and run it up against the entire U.S. database of patents, which is about 2-plus million active patents. We run it against all the inactive patents, all the expired patents. Think of it as a natural-language kind of way. You don't need to be a programmer any more for it to run up against the entire database.Tech patents are increasingly in the news: Story #2: China announces plans to triple the number of patents filed by 2020:  China is aiming to triple the number of patents it files by 2020 as Beijing looks to boost the country's high-tech economy in areas from agriculture to pharmaceuticals, according to a notice from the central government on Sunday. China is targeting 14 invention patents per 10,000 habitants by 2020 compared to four in 2013. It published 629,612 patents in 2013, over 200,000 more than the United States, according to a Thomson Reuters study in December. Beijing is also looking to reduce the length of the review process for patent and trademark applications. Patent reviews will decline to 20.2 months in 2020 from 22.3 months in 2013, while trademark reviews will fall to 9 months from 10 months. \"Intellectual property (IP) is increasingly becoming a vital component of China's strategic resources and competitive ability,\" the statement posted on the Central People's Government website said.Snapchat is raising funds in an unusual manner - has raised $485M from >23 Investors since April 2014, valuation >$10B, 200M MAU:  “[Snapchat] goes after individual investors at different valuations. It’s a rolling investment and a rolling close. In theory you could say he’s already done 40 rounds.” (40 is likely figurative rather than literal.) What this means is that, if it’s true, then yes, Snapchat may have raised nearly $500 million in the last six months. Of that $500 million, it may be that only 75% of it is closed, and with portions at different valuations, some getting in pre-$10-billion, like Yahoo, and some above it and closer to $20 billion.The SEC filing notes that the date of first sale was in April 2014. We’ve also heard that the current post money valuation is $20 billion, although others have disputed this and said it’s closer to $10 billion. The cash is much-needed. One source said that Snapchat has an over $30 million-per-year burn rate, and pays half of that to Google Apps Engine to host all its photos, though this number seems low to us. Another noted that at one point the company was paying $3 million each month in legal fees alone. Snapchat’s had its share of lawsuits. Monthly Active Users are now at 200M, up from 100M in August. Amazon was not one of the investors in this roundVMWare, Workday testing a data-driven technology to predict employee attrition:  VMware has been testing a new prediction technology from Workday, which makes software for human resources departments. The system delivers notifications about when employees might be getting ready to quit, and allows managers to intervene before it's too late. It looks for trends within employee activity, when promotions were last handed out, regional factors, changes in the industry and other data to make its predictions. The recommendations can improve over time as employers train the system. \"We've had some great results to date with the data,” Amy Gannaway, VMware’s senior director for worldwide human resources information systems, said at a Workday conference in September. The tool gave VMware \"a very high percentage\" of accurate predictions for which employees would leave the company, she said.The Indian Railways will soon launch an iOS app, as mobile travel bookings are surging in India: According to a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB International, the number of mobile Internet users has witnessed a steady rise to 159 million in October. This is estimated to reach 173 million by the end of December. There were 119 million users in urban India accessing the Internet on mobile devices in October. Rural India is not that far behind, with a base of 40 million mobile Internet users in October 2013. Indian Railways, which has the largest share in online bookings, is witnessing surge of mobile bookings as well. According to sources at IRCTC, its mobile ticket booking app receives 8,000-9,000 bookings a day through mobiles. The numbers are low compared with the 600,000 tickets booked online every day, but officials say they expect this segment to grow. \"Our mobile app has been downloaded 15,00,000 times on the Windows platform. On Android it has been downloaded 10,00,000 times. In a month's time we will be launching an app for iOS too,\" says a senior official on condition of anonymity.Grocery delivery startup Instacart is now valued at over $2B: Instacart has raised an additional $210 million, according to an SEC filing on Monday. The filing confirms a Series C funding round reported earlier this month, which values the company at more than $2 billion.Payments at a Tipping Point: Password-less authentication will drive more mobile transactions in 2015: \"Today, 85 percent of transactions are still done via cash, but 2014 started changing the game for payments, and I believe we’re at an inflection point to push more payments than ever into the digital realm for 2015 thanks to innovations in authentication, shopping on social networks, and near field communication-based payment technology.  The truth is only about 1 percent of commerce happens on mobile today, which is hard to believe considering there are now more mobile devices than people in the world. But I think that’s all about to change, and authentication is going to be an even bigger driver in mobile shopping and conversion in 2015.\"Good news for Chinese smartphone brands: Taiwan clears Xiaomi, others  of breaching data privacy: In September, Taiwan's government began performing independent tests on Xiaomi phones after media reports said that some models automatically send user data back to the firm's servers in mainland China. Taiwanese regulators cleared on Tuesday Xiaomi and other smartphone brands of breaching local data protection laws after national security concerns triggered that proble. The probe, which also involved Chinese handset makers Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp, was a reminder of the scrutiny Chinese technology firms are subject to abroad as governments become increasingly wary of potential cyber security threats from the world's second-biggest economy. Privately owned Xiaomi, whose budget smartphones are popular throughout Asia, was previously accused of breaching data privacy. In August, the company apologized and said it would change a default feature after a Finnish security company said Xiaomi collected address book data without users' permission. Uber must add 'panic buttons' to operate in Delhi:  Taxi firms including Uber, the online cab-hailing company banned in New Delhi, will have to install panic buttons if they are to operate in India's capital under new rules framed after allegations that a driver for the U.S. firm raped a passenger.The Delhi government now wants all taxi operators, including aggregators such as Uber, to have a fleet of taxis running on clean fuels and fitted with tracking devices and emergency buttons. \"The licensee shall ensure the facility of a panic button in the radio taxi so that in case of any distress, the signal is transmitted to the control center of the licensee and therefrom, to the nearest police station/police control room,\" Delhi's transport office said on its website.China blocks Gmail..:The Gmail blocking began on Friday and has ignited anger and frustration among many Internet users in China. Data from Google shows traffic to Gmail dropping to zero from Chinese servers. But it is not just a matter of convenience for Chinese Internet users. Some foreign companies use Gmail as their corporate email service, for example, and so companies will have to ensure that employees have V.P.N., or virtual private network, software to get into Gmail. Google is not the only company to be censored inside China. Facebook, the world’s largest social network, is essentially blocked there. Its Instagram photo-sharing service was briefly blocked this fall when pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong began using it to share photos with mainland Chinese users. When LinkedIn began offering a Chinese-language version of its business social network this year, it had to agree to censor content seen by Chinese users. This time, Gmail appeared to have been singled out. Representatives for Yahoo and Microsoft said on Monday that the companies had heard no complaints from users in China about their email services being blocked....and Google Search too: It isn't just Gmail. The government of China, which this weekend launched a tweak to its Great Firewall filtering regime that blocked much of mainland China's access to Google's e-mail service, has on Monday cut off access nationwide to Google Search as well, reports one Internet intelligence expert. And, says Earl Zmijewski, vice president of data analytics at the New Hampshire firm Dyn, the changes aren't the result of some accidental misconfiguration by a ham-handed government engineer in some backwater office somewhere. \"This was deliberate,\" Zmijewski says. \"It was pushed out to the whole country at once. Google and the Chinese government have long been at odds, with Google choosing to stop basing operations in mainland China in 2009 in response to Beijing's efforts at censorship. Google has chosen instead to offer services to mainland Chinese using servers located in Hong Kong. (In normal practice, Google attempts to route users to the servers located the closest to them, or otherwise most quickly accessible; a user in New Hampshire, for example, might be routed to New York.) But this week's actions suggest a raising of the Great Firewall specifically to cut that passageway between the Chinese people and Google's services in Hong Kong. Beijing is using the bluntest instrument it has available to it to keep Google out, and isn't worried much about who knows it. Simple blocking of Internet protocol, or IP, addresses is the \"easiest and crudest\" method that China has for maintaining the effectiveness of its Great Firewall. Beijing also uses so-called \"DNS poisoning,\" or the takeover of the address tables that govern the Internet so that a user who types, say, Twitter.com into her browser window is misdirected to another Web site. And then there's deep packet inspection, such as blocking online references to terms like \"Falun Gong\" or \"Dalai Lama.\" But those methods can be technologically tricky and expensive.Microsoft maybe building a new, lean browser: ZDNet’s Mary Jo Foley’s recent report that the software company is building a lightweight browser, codenamed “Spartan,” bears out. According to Foley, Spartan is “new” and “isn’t [Internet Explorer].” Her post notes that it could be set free inside of the Windows 10 release schedule. In short, Microsoft may be building a speedy, simpler browser that maintains use of Internet Explorer’s rendering engine.Airtel backs off from its plan to charge higher rates for online voice calls, will await regulations on net neutrality: Indian telecom company Airtel will temporarily withdraw the decision to charge a higher rate for making online voice calls on its data network. Airtel last week announced a new plan to charge customers for data usage on instant messaging and VoIP apps like Skype, Viber, Whatsapp, and Line. But now the telecom operator has decided to wait for a regulatory framework to be put in place, according to a statement today from Airtel. Indian telecom regulator TRAI chairman Rahul Khullar had earlier stated that that while Airtel’s move was going against the concept of net neutrality, it was not illegal as there is no policy or regulatory framework in India which mandates operators to adhere to net neutrality. Net neutrality is the notion that service providers must not differentiate between the traffic that flows over their network so that every user and service has equal access to the network. Qualcomm earns billions each year from its patent licensing, drawing Chinese telecom regulatory scrutiny: The settlement of China's anti-trust probe into Qualcomm Inc is likely to intensify global scrutiny of the firm's highly profitable patent licensing business, and may even call into question its worldwide contracts with smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung. Qualcomm is the top patent holder for cellphone technology, including many that form industry standards like CDMA and LTE. Charging royalties based on the cellphones' selling prices, even those made with competitors' chips, provided more than half of its $8 billion net income in 2014. As growth tapers in developed markets, the smartphone industry has turned to China, where the rollout of LTE technology is driving demand, and where the majority of the world's smartphones are also manufactured. The NDRC, one of China's anti-trust regulators, has said it suspects Qualcomm of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. Qualcomm is expected by industry sources to agree to changes in how it charges royalties on cellphones sold in China, which will hurt its bottom line in its fastest-growing and most significant market. Qualcomm earned about half of its global revenue of $26.5 billion in China for the fiscal year ended Sept. 28. An agreement to lower royalty rates charged by Qualcomm on phones sold in China could affect its contractual relationships not just with local manufacturers such as Huawei, Lenovo, ZTE and Xiaomi Inc, but also with bigger global players that make and sell phones in China, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics, said patent lawyers consulted by Reuters.Top 10 Pricing Mistakes, e-Commerce companies make, according to TechCrunch: 1: Basing prices on costs, not customers’ perceptions of value. 2: Companies base their prices on “the marketplace.” 3: Same profit margin across different product lines. 4: Companies fail to segment their customers. 5: Companies hold prices at the same level for too long. 6: Salespeople incentivized strictly on revenue. 7: Changing prices without forecasting competitors’ reactions. 8: Companies spend insufficient resources managing their pricing practices. 9: Companies fail to establish internal procedures to optimize prices. 10: Companies rely on salespeople and other customer-facing staff for pricing intelligence.Indonesian ecommerce: Online share of retail: This year, of the nation’s US$411.29 billion in retail spending, Indonesia saw an uptick to US$2.6 billion spent in ecommerce. eCommerce Leaders: Lazada Indonesia, Rocket Internet’s answer to Amazon, made the jump to the top spot in 2014. SingPost reasons that Lazada took the lead because it made a shift away from consumer electronics and focused more on lifestyle goods. Lazada’s marketing campaigns in Bahasa Indonesia were also key wins for Rocket. Category Preferences: While Indonesians shop across multiple categories, the most popular one is by far clothing and apparel, with 61.7 percent of the nation’s online shoppers making a purchase in that category last year. Females reign supreme in the archipelago’s ecommerce space, with women having higher purchase rates, and the highest spending amount on clothing, mobile devices, travel items, laptops, and accessories. Means of Payment: Bank transfers are the most popular way to pay for online transactions, followed by cash on delivery, and finally credit cards. Less than five percent of Indonesia’s population own credit cards, and credit card payments still account for less than 10 percent of all online transactions in the archipelago.Alibaba’s 2014 investments and acquisitions: List below - 33 transactions, known investments of about $5.3B (could be a lot higher, since about half these transactions are of unknown sizes)Snapdeal launches offering for farming and agriculture inputs for farmers. The store currently offers over hundred products across categories like seeds, irrigation and farming tools. The firm has started with some 300 SKUs to begin with and also plans to launch a hindi version of the store. On the face of it, the approach seems to be unique, however what could be interesting to see is how does Snapdeal makes it simpler to buy such products online or for that matter the smartphone. Moreover, how does it tackle the pain point of logistics without bloating up the cost of purchase and cash payments in remote villages. We tried checking for some random fertiliser for a remote village in eastern region in India and the site threw up a “Product cannot be delivered at your pincode location” message. But to be fair its the first day of its official launch.Gift cards are the best gifts, research shows: the less specific the gift, the more it will be appreciated. The sad truth is that while gift cards constitute a minority of holiday gifts, according to the National Retail Federation, they have been the most popular gift request since 2007. In studies to be presented early next year at a conference of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, researchers tried to analyze the emotional turmoil churned up by the exchanging of gifts, noting that the giver’s earnest intentions may often widely miss the mark of the recipient’s true desires. The closer the relationship, the more thought givers believe they should put into selecting a gift. But when subjects were asked what they would like to receive, they overwhelmingly replied that they wanted credit-card gift cards, which would give them the flexibility to choose exactly what they want. Huawei's smartphone sales shoot up after copying Xiaomi's online strategy: China's Huawei has taken sales of its low-price Honor brand of smartphones to 20 million from 1 million in just one year, hitting pay dirt with the disruptive online-only strategy it copied from smaller upstart Xiaomi. Privately owned Xiaomi, valued at over $45 billion, sold 15.8 million smartphones in July-September versus Huawei's 15.9 million, according to Gartner. A year earlier, Xiaomi reached just 3.6 million compared with 11.7 million for Huawei. But analysts say the low-cost strategy has fanned the price wars and thin profit margins prevalent in China, and that its spread could affect margins at all makers. Honor brand president Jeff Liu said industry transition to an online sales strategy was inevitable given the competitive pricing, afforded by reduced distribution expenses that would otherwise make up 30 percent of handset costs. \"E-commerce is massively changing the traditional channels for the smartphone industry, and we needed to go in that direction too,\" Liu said in an interview in Beijing, where he unveiled the Honor 6 Plus smartphone last week. Honor handsets dropped the Huawei name last December and have since been marketed and distributed independently of Huawei-branded phones. They are sold in countries ranging from Belgium to Brazil, primarily via marketplaces such as those of JD.com Inc in China and Flipkart in India. Indian startup action: Six startups selected for Kyron’s new accelerator batch: Cubito: It has developed an employee transport system that features automated grouping, routing & driver allocation, besides information exchanges between employee & drivers. All allocations are done in real time.  Xpense Manager: It is an app that aims to simplify process of expense claims & reimbursements inside companies by way of supporting the business workflow of approvals & support for policies for employee expense & reimbursements. Eywa Media Innovations: It aims to make TV watching interactive and fun. The company claims to have partnered with a leading broadcaster in India already. Viamagus : A SaaS startup, Viamagus claims it helps simplify the way businesses and individuals build & maintain their online presence and do business online. Its cloud- based tools help you build websites & portfolios, blogs, e-mail/SMS campaigns and landing pages quickly, and in a code-free and fully hosted manner. The firm has over 100 customers. Cashkumar: It is an online platform that claims to be providing the best rates for foreign currency exchange in Bangalore, Mumbai and Pune. With an aggregation platform backed by a reverse bidding process, travellers can buy or sell their foreign currency and travel insurance at the best possible rates. Adwyze: It is a marketing optimisation platform that allows marketers to improve the performance of their marketing budgets. Intel's margins are being buoyed by rising prices for custom chips for cloud computing: Companies like A.W.S. “are running a million servers, so floor space, power, cooling, people — you want to optimize everything,” Ms. Bryant said. “The name of the game is customization.” Indeed. Amazon has gone so far as to change around the 50 megawatt power substations that power its bunkers of computers. Deep in Google, former company executives say, the company has changed the way Internet packets of data work, to optimize how quickly they flow through Google. Facebook, which has by far the world’s largest public repository of pictures, might want a certain number of chips that can render images well, or rapidly process the steps for image recognition. That could affect the number of processing cores it wants on a chip. When eBay installed a hyper-efficient cooling system, it asked Intel for chips that had a greater thermal tolerance (they can be worked harder that way.) The difference appears to be showing up in Intel’s results. While most of Intel’s chips still go into PCs, about one-quarter of Intel’s revenue, and a much bigger share of its profits, come from semiconductors for data centers. In the first nine months of 2014, the average selling price of PC chips fell 4 percent. But the average price on data center chips was up 10 percent, compared with the same period in 2013.Xiaomi close to raising $1B, valuation seen at ~$45B: Xiaomi raises over $1B from All-Stars Investment, DST Global, others. The round, which is expected to be closed this week, would value Xiaomi at more than $45 billion, as per this report. Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi, which also has a good presence in India, has netted over $1 billion in funding led by All-Stars Investment, an investment firm launched by former Morgan Stanley analyst Richard Ji, says a The Wall Street Journal report quoting an unnamed source. Russian investment firm DST Global, besides Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC also participated in the round.Flipkart raises $700M, valuation seen at ~$11B: Flipkart, India’s largest e-commerce marketplace, has raised $700 million in fresh investment from existing as well as new investors Baillie Gifford, Greenoaks Capital, Steadview Capital, T Rowe Price Associates and Qatar Investment Authority. The e-commerce powerhouse, which is on a fund-raising spree, has raised funding for the third time in 2014. In May, it had raised $210 million (about Rs 1,200 crore). It had raised funding worth $1 billion (about Rs 6,000) in July. The latest round of fund-raising has seen investment from existing stakeholders DST Global, GIC, ICONIQ Capital and Tiger Global. According to reports, the latest fund-raising has pegged Flipkart’s valuation at $11 billion. Snapdeal.com partners with Hero MotoCorp to sell two-wheelers through its platform: Snapdeal claims that it saw 700 two-wheelers being sold within 72 hours of launching the new category a week ago. The vehicles are priced as same as offline dealerships. For Snapdeal, automobile is one of the most promising categories, and it expects it to reach Rs 1,000 crores in GMV in the near term.Credit derivatives traders helping RadioShack stay alive: RadioShack is finding an unlikely ally in its efforts to stay out of bankruptcy: credit derivatives traders who amassed more than $25 billion of trades speculating how much longer it can keep paying its bills. When the retailer’s biggest shareholder arranged $585 million of funding in October to help it survive the holidays, much of the money came from hedge funds wagering on the company to avoid default, said people with knowledge of the trading. By injecting the 93-year-old electronics retailer with new money, swaps traders, more often blamed for pushing companies toward bankruptcy, have been preserving big payoffs if they can delay or prevent a default. “The sellers of the protection built up quite a large war chest, and it took a relatively small amount of money to keep the company going,” said Peter Tchir, a former credit-swaps trader who is now head of macro strategy at Brean Capital LLC in New York. “They have huge incentives to keep the company alive to not trigger the swaps.”IBM says its cloud business is having a 'breakthrough year': IBM aims to expand the number of data centers it offers clients around the world by 25 percent to meet fast-rising demand for internet-based services, after what a company executive said has been a \"breakthrough year\" in 2014 for its cloud computing business. IBM has quadrupled the number of cloud data facilities it offers around the world to 49 in the past 18 months, responding in part to laws requiring the local retention of data following revelations over U.S. government Web surveillance as well as increased corporate compliance rules. IBM's cloud revenue amounted to $4.4 billion in 2013 and was up by 50 percent in the first nine months of this year, it reported in October, making it one of IBM's fastest-growing businesses IBM has announced multi-year deals in recent weeks worth a total of more than $4 billion that are fuelling the company's expansion in data centers. The company's cloud computing services let companies mix classic computing jobs with new ways of working, a twist on the largely consumer-facing cloud services made popular by Amazon's Web Services, Google and Microsoft. IBM, along with rivals Hewlett-Packard and EMC's VMware, offer “hybrid cloud” services that let customers run key business data on private, internal networks along with consumer-facing public cloud systems.Zomato expands in Italy by acquiring Cibando: After recently adding a presence in Central and Eastern Europe by means of two local acquisitions, the New Delhi-headquartered company, which now boasts a presence in 20 countries, has gobbled up Italy’s Cibando. Terms of the acquisition remain undisclosed, though Zomato says all of Cibando’s team will be joining the company and will now lead its efforts to build out the service in Italy. This will include integrating Cibando into Zomato, thus transitioning its user base and traffic. It also plans to scale up its teams in Rome and Milan to 30-40 full-time employees over the next three months, up from Cibando’s current headcount of 10. Even longer term, Zomato says it will invest $6 million in its newly-acquired Italian operations over the next 2 years, growing the team to 150-200 people across the country’s top six cities. That planned increase in headcount is probably a reflection of Zomato’s relatively labor-intensive business model, at least compared to other pure Internet plays. To power part of its restaurant search and discovery engine, the company collects menus from restaurants and scans them using OCR. Its menu data is then re-checked in person by Zomato’s team every three months to ensure it stays relatively fresh, and it’s this “feet on the street” approach that attempts to differentiate the company from competitors, such as Yelp, IAC-owned Urbanspoon, Priceline-acquired OpenTable, and TripAdvisor. Discussing today’s acquisition, Zomato co-founder Pankaj Chaddah tells me that Cibando is one of the largest restaurant search services in Italy and lists 82,000 restaurants across various cities. In November, the company closed a further $60 million in funding, giving it a post-money valuation of $660 million, and taking total funding to over $113 million.Sony cancels movie release after terror threats: Sony Pictures Entertainment on Wednesday dropped plans for its Christmas Day release of “The Interview,” a movie that depicts the assassination of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, after receiving a terror threat against theaters. Before that, the four largest theater chains in the United States said they would not show the movie, which has been at the center of a devastating hacking attack on Sony over the last several weeks. American intelligence officials on Wednesday concluded that the North Korean government was centrally involved with the attacks on Sony’s computers. That determination and the cancellation of the film were new twists in a series of developments that has found a major studio fighting for its art, and perhaps life, against forces driven by a foreign government. Hackers claim to have taken at least 100 terabytes of Sony data, or about 10 times of the amount stored in the Library of Congress. Sony computer systems were damaged and the studio is already the focus of at least two lawsuits from former employees who had their personal information spread online. Indian startup action: Zepo.in, Livspace get funding:  Zepo.in, a do-it-yourself (DIY) e-commerce platform for SMBs, has secured an undisclosed amount in funding led by Anupam Mittal, CEO of People Group, which operates the internet properties including Shaadi.com and makaan.com. Zepo can help an SMB to open its online shop in a few minutes for under Rs 999 per month. It also provides them free payment gateway, logistics support and marketing. With 20 employees on board, Zepo has offices in Delhi and Bangalore. The firm mainly competes with Nirvana Venture Advisors-backed KartRocket.com, besides MartMobi, Shopify and CostPrize. Livspace, an online marketplace for personalised home interior design and décor, has received $4.6 million in its Series A round of funding. Livspace claims that it enables homeowners to discover thousands of pre-created looks for all rooms, kitchen, and storage areas in their homes at the click of a button. Customers can select and purchase these looks, which are created by international designers, and personalise them (by material, colour, style) online. The startup will then deliver the items at the customers’ doorsteps. Livspace has partnered with many real-estate developers in the country and also offers a ‘find your apartment’ feature to offer pre-created, ready-to-install interior design for customers who buy homes from these developers.Chinese phone maker OnePlus, selling on Amazon in India, has been barred by the Delhi HC from selling, marketing, or importing phones in India. The dispute centers around OnePlus using Cyanogenmod’s version of Android, which is licensed exclusively in India by rival phone brand Micromax. OnePlus received a shock in October when Micromax acquired the rights to be Cyanogen’s exclusive partner in India in order to launch Micromax’s new YU Cyanogen phone on December 18. Cyanogen has already clarified that OnePlus One phones sold in India will not receive updates. In return, OnePlus says it will start work on a custom Android build for its users in India. The high court has allowed the Chinese company, which launched its OnePlus One phones in India through Amazon on December 2, to clear its stock of Cyanogen-based products.Apple Pay continues to gain traction: On Tuesday, Apple announced that in recent weeks the company had signed up dozens more banks, retail stores and start-ups to adopt Apple Pay, the company’s new e-commerce product, which allows customers to buy things with little more than a wave of their iPhone. The new companies that recently agreed to work with the service include SunTrust, Barclaycard and USAA. Ten more banks, including TD Bank North America and Commerce Bank, will back the new form of payment on Tuesday. With the new additions, Apple says it supports the cards that represent about 90 percent of the credit card purchase volume in the United States.  While Apple Pay still accounts for a tiny fraction of total transactions, the new additions suggest that Apple has generated more traction for the service than any competing service. Others giant companies like Google, Verizon and AT&T have offered similar takes on a smartphone-based e-commerce product, though to little avail.Xiaomi India ban on Redmi Note 4G, the Mi3, and the Redmi 1S lifted; Redmi Note remains fully banned: Delhi HC partially lifts the ban on Chinese handset maker Xiaomi for importing & selling smartphones in India. Today’s ruling allows Xiaomi to sell only Qualcomm-powered smartphones in India, and only until January 8, 2015. This allows Xiaomi to sell three of the four models it had launched in India – the Redmi Note 4G, the Mi3, and the Redmi 1S. The MediaTek-powered Redmi Note remains fully banned. The Delhi High Court has now permitted the company to sell and import Qualcomm chipset-based (a licensee of Ericsson) handsets in the country till Jan 8, 2015, according to a tweet by PTI. A Mint report further mentions that Xiaomi has also been told to deposit Rs 100 for every device it has sold in India or sells till January 5. Last month, Jun Lei, co-founder and CEO, Xiaomi, had said that India is becoming its largest overseas market for Xiaomi. According to the company, it has already sold over 500,000 smartphones in the country in less than four months of operations. It is now also considering setting up a manufacturing base in the country.Big data companies are acting far more as services companies than they hope to be eventually: Data science, as a business, is still young. As the technology moves beyond the Internet incubators like Google and Facebook, it has to be applied company by company, in one industry after another. At this stage, there is a lot of hand craftsmanship rather than software automation. So the aspiring software companies find themselves training, advising and building pilot projects for their commercial customers. They are acting far more as services companies than they hope to be eventually. For now, the technical hand-holding and pump-priming is an essential step. The young companies are building the market of commercial users in retailing, finance, consumer products, health care and other industries to which they will then sell software. The cost of chasing the big data opportunity can be daunting. A glimpse into one company’s bet was revealed last month, when Hortonworks filed documents to prepare for selling shares to the public. Hortonworks is a leading distributor of the open-source Hadoop software, which is a database for handling so-called unstructured data from the web, sensors and smartphones, used in big data analytics. The company’s financial statements show rapid growth in revenue, more than doubling in the nine months that ended on Sept. 30, to $33.4 million. But its costs surged, resulting in a net loss of $86.7 million, well more than double its total revenue.SurveyMonkey raises $250M, valued at ~ $2B: SurveyMonkey, the Silicon Valley company that runs an online survey and questionnaire platform, announced today that it has raised $250 million in a new round of funding. The raise was first reported last night by the Wall Street Journal, and was officially confirmed by the company this morning. The new money will be used at least in part to fuel more M&A transactions, and to allow some existing investors and employees to cash out if they choose, SurveyMonkey said in a statement. This brings the total amount of venture capital invested into the 15-year-old company to more than $1.15 billion. The new round, which included participation from a group of institutional investors, reportedly values SurveyMonkey at some $2 billion, up significantly from the $1.35 billion valuation the company had just one year ago.Uber surge prices during Sydney standoff, then backs off, also UberPop banned in France. On Monday, as the police surrounded a cafe in Sydney, Australia, where an armed individual was holding hostages, Uber began raising rates. The move, which the company calls surge pricing, is governed by an algorithm and occurs whenever demand spikes for rides in an area. The idea is that higher rates give drivers incentive to fill the demand. With the authorities cordoning off part of the city’s central business district, many who were stranded in the area were forced to pay roughly four times the normal rate, according to complaints on social media. In a relatively quick response, the company released a statement explaining what happened. “Surge pricing is algorithmic and responded automatically to the large increase in demand for Uber rides out of the C.B.D.,” it said, referring to the central business district. “As soon as we became aware of the situation, we capped it and made all rides free to people leaving Sydney’s C.B.D. Uber is paying for these rides. If riders got charged surge pricing earlier, we will refund it.”Baidu said to buy stake in Uber, Boosting App in China: Baidu Inc. (BIDU) is buying a minority stake in Uber Technologies Inc., giving the car-booking company a boost as it expands in China, according to a person familiar with the matter. Uber will receive cash and non-cash assets, including Baidu’s online resources as owner of China’s biggest Internet search engine, the person said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private. The investment may be worth as much as $600 million, China National Radio reported earlier. Uber is expanding in China and hiring in 14 cities, according to a July 1 LinkedIn post. Uber has been targeting customers willing to pay a premium for the luxury of tracking the vehicle’s approach, not handling local cash and finding daily newspapers and a Wi-Fi access inside the car.Alibaba's efforts to position 12/12 as another Singles Day (focused on Taobao) seem to have met with only mixed success: Alibaba has tried hard to position Double 12 as a similar shopping bonanza to Singles Day. Last year, it promoted the day heavily on Taobao and flooded other online and offline channels with advertisements. Taobao bought most of the internet portal traffic, and “12/12” signage saturated billboards and bus stops. After stressing that the nature of December 12 is different from November 11, Alibaba has kept the traffic and revenue results from the past two Double 12s on the down-low. The lack of numbers released has led many to believe that Double 12’s results didn’t live up to Alibaba’s initial expectations. The reason for the underwhelming sales? Hard to say for sure, but there are many theories. First off, it’s been just a month since Singles Day. Retailers’ inventory and consumers’ budgets may not be sufficient enough to take part in the 12/12 extravaganza. Also, it’s possible that the two-thirds of Taobao retailers that didn’t take part in Double 12 ran out of inventory or turned to offline sales channels for the rest of the holiday shopping season. Retail logistics make it harder for smaller companies on Taobao to be as flexible on price as the big dogs on Tmall. They also can’t offer up the same kinds of amazing bargains Chinese consumers are now accustomed to.India startup action: Bangalore-based Blowhorn offers an online marketplace focused on last mile logistics services: Mithun Srivatsa, director of operations, Walmart Labs, co-founded Blowhorn, an online marketplace for last mile logistics services, along with his classmate from NIT Nagpur Nikhil Shivaprasad (CTO), in November 2013. “Currently, mini-truck drivers suffer from inefficient utilisation, sometimes not getting a booking for a load to carry for a day or more. At the same time, consumers have ever-increasing needs to move things around the crowded streets of India’s major metros. We bring them together seamlessly,” said Srivatsa, CEO of Blowhorn. The Bangalore-based startup claims to be receiving a lot of demand from people buying from online classifieds sites like OLX and Quikr, as well other second hand goods groups on social media. The firm charges Rs 600 for the first hour and pro-rated every 10 minutes thereafter. Last month, the startup had raised an undisclosed amount in seed funding from impact investor Unitus Seed Fund, with participation from Tim Draper, founder and managing partner of Draper Associates. While the space is new and unexplored in India, there are examples of such startups globally. In Asia, Hong Kong-based GoGoVan provides similar services and has presence in Singapore and Taiwan, besides its home city.SoftBank shrinks U.S. office, hurt by its Sprint investment, marking end of failed T-Mobile bid: Japan's SoftBank Corp (9984.T) will soon downsize its Silicon Valley offices, people with knowledge of the matter said, signaling the company won't revive efforts to buy T-Mobile U.S. IncXiaomi Confirms It Has Suspended Sales In India, “open to working with Ericsson to resolve this matter amicably”: Hugo Barra revealed the temporary pause in India, which is triggered by a patent suit brought against the company by Ericsson, via an update on Google+. Initially, Xiaomi told media it had not received a notice from the high court, but that situation has changed now. Xiaomi told TechCrunch yesterday that it is “open to working with Ericsson to resolve this matter amicably” so this situation may yet be remedied quickly and without too much disruption to its sales in India. Indeed, Ericsson has struck recent patent deals with a number of India-based phone makers, and it may be holding out for a similar arrangement with Xiaomi.Reliance Capital is set to sell its 16% in Yatra.com for INR 500 Crore; Yatra valuation ~ USD 500 Million: per cent stake in travel portal Yatra.com for an estimated Rs 500 crore ($80 million) and is in talks with two-three international investors. The deal would mark an over 12x appreciation for this investment by Reliance Capital, the financial services arm of Anil Ambani-led business conglomerate Reliance Group, which had acquired a 16 per cent stake in the online travel company for Rs 40 crore in 2006. While the spokesperson did not give further details, sources said Reliance Cap aims to close the transaction in four-six weeks and the deal would put the total valuation of Yatra.com at around $500 million (Rs 3,000 crore). In the fast-growing Indian online travel business, Yatra.com competes with NASDAQ-listed MakeMyTrip, which commands a market value of $1.2 billion. During the last fiscal 2013-14, MakeMyTrip is estimated to have clocked total transaction value of $1.38 billion on its platforms, as against $763 million by Yatra. The operating income of MakeMyTrip and Yatra stood at $116 million and $51 million, respectively, for the year.eBay might cut 10% of its workforce, primarily in marketing, and increases its (small) investment in Indonesia: Ebay is considering eliminating almost 10 percent of its workforce, or about 3,000 employees, the WSJ cited one source as saying. The cuts are expected to be localized in the company'smarketplace division, the report said. Separately, US-based ecommerce giant eBay plans to increase its ownership in Indonesia’s MetraPlasa from 40 percent to 49 percent, local media outlet Berita Satu reports. “Ebay can increase to 49 percent and they can also have the option to become the majority shareholder. There are stages for them to get there and they want to do it quickly. But I can not disclose anything more,” said Telkom’s acting president director Indra Utoyo in Jakarta on Monday. Ebay remains a strategic partner for Telkom as it will allow for future cross-border trading, and for products on the Blanja site to eventually be sold overseas. Blanja claims to have one million products on its site from only 600 sellers. It recieves a mere 50,000 visitors per day. “Currently, the revenue contribution of ecommerce to our business remains small,” says Utoyo. “But we estimate the contribution could reach 10 percent within two to three years.”Coupang, Korea's Amazon\" raises USD 300M, valuation > USD 1B, GMV runrate USD 2.2B: Coupang, a fast-growing e-commerce company in South Korea, has raised $300 million of additional financing to aid its expansion plans. While Bom Kim, the chief executive, declined to disclose the company’s valuation, he said it was higher than the roughly $1 billion price tag the company achieved in its previous financing round. He also said the company now had about $500 million of cash in the bank. Coupang, based in Seoul, calls itself the Amazon of Korea. In addition to selling its own inventory, the company allows third-party merchants to sell through its site. While it competes in Korea with eBay and a site called 11th Street, Coupang says its competitive edge stems from its focus on ordering through mobile devices and from its delivery network. Like Amazon, Coupang has built its own warehouses, called fulfillment centers. But it has gone a step beyond Amazon by also employing its own delivery workers, whom it calls “Coupang men.” (Mr. Kim said the fleet includes some women as well.) These workers, who try to build relationships with customers by doing things like leaving handwritten notes, can often deliver packages on the day they are ordered. Mr. Kim, 36, who started Coupang in late 2010 after dropping out of Harvard Business School, said the company was now generating gross sales — the total value of goods passing through the site — of $2.2 billion on an annualized basis. He said roughly one in three people in South Korea had downloaded the company’s app.12 small Indian startups: Price comparison site YouTellMe, online testing platform Youth4Work and 10 startups picked for TiE Bangalore’s 2nd accelerator batch: EventsHigh: aggregates information related to events and allows users to explore them based on their interests and locality.

Microsoft Azure launches its government cloud offering for the US: Microsoft today announced that its Azure Government cloud computing service for federal, state, local and tribal U.S. governments is now generally available after more than a year of being in preview. This means the service is now open to all U.S. government customers. There are no more preview programs and the service is also now open for all workloads. By default, Azure Government ensures that all data stays within the U.S. and within data centers and networks that are physically isolated from the rest of Microsoft’s cloud computing solution. It’s in compliance with FedRAMP, a mandatory government-wide program that prescribes a standardized way to carry out security assessments for cloud services. It also supports a wide range of other compliance standards, including HIPAA and the FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS), which is meant to keep safe fingerprint and background-check data that has to be shared with other agencies. Amazon has long been offering a similar service for government authorities with its GovCloud. Uber's run of bad news continues (India, Spain, Thailand, the Netherlands); India cracks down on unregistered taxis, Uber defiant: A run of bad news for Uber continued on Tuesday, when Spain and Thailand ordered the ride-sharing service to cease operations in the two countries. In Madrid, a commercial court judge sided with a taxi association complaint, saying that Uber must cease driving in Spain until a lawsuit contesting its right to operate can be heard. In Bangkok, the Thai transport authorities ordered Uber to shut down after finding that its drivers lacked the registration and insurance needed to operate commercial vehicles, Reuters reported. Just one day earlier, officials in New Delhi, the Indian capital, ordered Uber to cease its operations there after one of its drivers was accused of raping a passenger. Also on Monday, a Dutch appeals court upheld that Uber drivers who transport passengers without a taxi license are violating Dutch law. The court said the company would be subject to immediate fines if it continued to operate its UberPop service, which enables any licensed driver with a car and Uber-issued device to pick up passengers.Chinese provider of free public wifi in exchange for ads gets $49M investment from Tencent, Dianpin: WiWide, a Chinese startup that provides public wifi networks to stores and restaurants, has received an RMB 300 million (US$49 million) series C funding round from Tencent and Dianping, according to TechNode. Over 500 domestic and international franchises use WiWide in China, including Starbucks, Burger King, and several airports. Its advertising clients include Jaguar, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Nokia, Lenovo, and HTC, whose ads get pushed to customers once they connect. Altogether, the company runs over 30,000 hotspots. WiWide offers an end-to-end solution, meaning it provides the routers and other hardware, network architecture, professional installation, and a dashboard application for businesses to keep track of connected customers.Banned in Delhi, sued 4 days after launch by the city of Portland, Uber fights on: [Delhi] Delhi Police investigators have been scathing in describing their dealings with Uber. Mr. Verma said he was unable to find any contact number or email address for Uber on its web pages and finally located its headquarters by booking an Uber cab and asking to be taken to the company's head office, which turned out to be several rooms in a hotel. He said he was not able to get any information about Friday's bookings for five hours because the database was located in New York. Mr. Verma also said that Uber had failed to demand that Mr. Yadav show a badge, which can only be acquired by submitting to a criminal background check. He said Uber had registered Mr. Yadav under an inaccurate residential address, had not registered his vehicle as a cab, and had not installed a global positioning system in the vehicle, which is mandatory for commercial taxis. Uber, which has been valued by investors at more than $40 billion, is running into similar problems in cities in other countries. A Dutch court on Monday prohibited the UberPop service, which links clients with drivers who do not have professional licenses, from operating in the Netherlands. The UberPop service has been banned in the German cities of Berlin and Hamburg, and London's main taxi association has brought lawsuits against Uber and a number of its drivers. Lawmakers in Thailand and Vietnam have banned the service, and the city government in Seoul has said it plans to do the same. Uber just launched in Portland on Friday, but the City’s Transportation Bureau has already sued, alleging Uber violates licensing lawsThe massive hacker attack on Sony, possibly by groups linked to North Korea, continues to dominate headlines; security flaws exposed: North Korea says its supporters may be behind Sony attack:The attack shut down most of the studio's network for more than a week and hackers have released sensitive data over the Internet, including employee salaries and Social Security numbers along with high-quality digital versions of several unreleased films. A key weakness was that few security measures existed between the computers of the Japanese company’s divisions around the world, so hackers could move with relative ease throughout the corporation, said the person, who asked to remain anonymous because the information is confidential. The most recent attacks suggests Sony hasn’t done enough since the last episode. The company put itself and others at risk by not putting passwords or encryption on the files that would have made them more difficult for hackers to open, according to Todd Feinman, chief executive officer of Identity Finder LLC, a New York-based provider of data management software.India's smartphone market is surging (23M in Q3 2014, 82% Y/Y), even as China's reaches saturation (105M in Q3 2014, 10.8%): The latest figures from IDC show that smartphone shipments in India grew 82 percent in the past 12-month period, while China saw growth of just 10.8 percent. Admittedly, India is still a small-ish market in relative terms, with an estimated 23.3 million smartphones shipped to retailers in Q3 2014, versus 105 million in China. Basic, non-smart phones still account for the majority of mobile sales in India, but that means a seismic shift is now underway to Android, iOS, and Windows Phone devices. Cheaper Android phones are helping push this forward in the very price-sensitive market. The ratio of feature phones to smartphones shipped in India is now 68:32, which has changed a lot from 78:22 at the end of last year, and 90:10 at the end of 2012.Uber terms of service face scrutiny as firm faces the possibility of legal action in India following arrest of rape suspect: Madhur Verma, New Delhi police deputy commissioner, said that police will also take legal action against Uber — valued at $40 billion — for failure to run checks on the driver’s background and whether he had an adequate GPS device in his car. The police are taking legal advice before deciding whether it would be a criminal or civil case. Earlier reports suggest that the suspect had disabled GPS during the incident, which occurred late on Friday night or early Saturday morning. The suspect allegedly parked the car in a secluded area after the passenger, said to be in her mid-twenties, fell asleep. He then raped her and threatened her life if she reported anything. Shockingly enough, Uber’s terms of service don’t necessarily protect against this. You can have a read through it right here, if you’d like, but the main argument is this: Uber is not a transportation company, but rather a technology service that matches seekers of transportation (riders) with providers of transportation (drivers). By using Uber, and accepting the obligatory ToS, you are acknowledging that each and every driver that picks you up in any city in the world is a third-party (not Uber), and thus, Uber is not responsible for any of their actions. This is hardly the first time that a dispute (to put it lightly) has arisen between an Uber driver and a passenger or pedestrian. One man was hit over the head with a hammer, and a six-year-old girl was killed when hit by a driver. This isn’t even the first rape allegation against an Uber driver.Uber raises $1.2B of new funding, valuation of $40B (>Tesla, 4x of AirBnb) also raises $1B convertible debt (with hint of IPO less than 4 years away): Uber closed a new $1.2 billion round of financing on Thursday, with investors valuing the company at a staggering $40 billion. That puts a new mountain of cash on top of the $1.5 billion that Uber had already raised. The company is now valued at four times that of other elite Silicon Valley startups, such as Airbnb Inc. Uber’s value also dwarfs Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA), which has a market capitalization of $28.6 billion. General Motors Co., the largest U.S. automaker, has a $53.2 billion market capitalization. Uber is also building its finances with a more than $1 billion convertible debt sale to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)’s wealth management clients. The clients are getting a chance to buy a six-year bond in Uber that will convert into equity at a 20 percent to 30 percent discount to the company’s valuation at the time of an initial public offering, said people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Goldman Sachs isn’t investing its own money in the debt, said the people. The convertible bond carries a coupon that increases over time if Uber hasn’t gone public within 4 years, said the people. “It’s interesting that, with the convertible debt, Uber is putting itself under pressure to go public within 4 years,” Sanwal said.\n",
      "SoftBank Invests $250M In GrabTaxi, Uber’s Archrival In Southeast Asia; valuation > $1B: Neither party has confirmed what the deal values GrabTaxi at, but the company’s valuation is likely to exceed the $1 billion mark. The duo did confirm that SoftBank has become GrabTaxi’s largest investor. The round is the highest raise for a startup in Southeast Asia to date — Rocket Internet companies aside — and it is GrabTaxi’s fourth funding activity this calendar year, taking it past $320 million in capital from investors. GrabTaxi’s previous $65 million round closed in October and was led by Tiger Global — which also invested in Uber rival Ola — while GGV Capital led a $15 million raise in May. Its $10 million-plus Series A was announced in April. GrabTaxi was founded in Malaysia in 2012, has over 500 staff and is live in 17 cities across six countries in Southeast Asia: Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia. Its core offering is a service that connects registered taxis with would-be passengers via its app — thus working with the existing industry rather than against it — but it also offers an Uber-like private car service and is trialling motorbike taxis in Vietnam.\n",

      "Uber's take on hiring tech talent: tie up with a collective - then hire the team and open an engineering office around them: To spearhead its mobile growth, Uber is setting up a mobile development shop in Amsterdam, led by one of its earliest employees and staffed by a set of new hires: a team of Dutch developers who originally worked on Uber’s Spotify integration and have served as advisors to the company since 2009. Uber has effectively taken on 10 former employees from Dutch firm Moop.me, which effectively functions as a collective of engineers and designers. Uber has not acquired the whole agency, because Moop’s people have also taken on other projects that have very little synergy with what Uber is today. Those projects, and Moop, will continue.\n",

      "Stripe doubled its valuation to $3.5B; payment start-up that partners with Apple Pay, Alipay, Facebook, Twitter: Stripe, an e-commerce start-up based in San Francisco, announced on Tuesday that it had raised a new $70 million round in venture capital. The round, which includes Sequoia Capital and Thrive Capital, values Stripe at $3.5 billion, twice the amount the company was valued at less than one year ago. The company, which was founded by brothers, John and Patrick Collison, in 2009, offers payment processing services for small and medium-size businesses that want to sell items online. It competes with the likes of companies like PayPal, which has long dominated the online payments industry. The company has also secured partnerships with Facebook and Twitter — which allow for users to buy things directly inside of these social platforms — and recently announced a deal with Alipay, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in China. Stripe plans to use its new capital to continue to add to its existing staff of 180 employees, and push harder into international markets. It also plans to bolster the set of tools it offers to developers who use Stripe to process payments for their businesses. More here and here.\n",

      "IBM signs $1.25B cloud deal with WPP, and differentiates with hybrid focus: IBM seeks to differentiate its offering by focusing on hybrid clouds, which mix together the private, on-premise computer systems for which it has long been known with newer public-facing Internet, mobile and analytics systems, allowing clients to move existing systems to the cloud at their own pace. This hybrid approach means companies can wait for years before they consider moving their most sensitive core financial systems to the cloud computers. It also gives them the option of never having to move. Secondly, European clients demand that their data remain stored locally in European data center, a requirement IBM has met by building seven public cloud data centers across Europe in London, Amsterdam, Paris and one in Germany, with another to follow there shortly.\n",

      "Smart home-audio market continues to heat up - Sonos raises $130M:  After Amazon's launch of Echo, and Apple's purchase of Beats, Sonos, in the smart home audio business since 2002, just raised $130 million, according to an SEC filing. The funding adds to Sonos’ previous $325 million, bringing it to around $455 million. That makes it a very, very well capitalized startup. It’s so big that probably no one but Google or Apple could afford to acquire it. Considering Apple’s personal audio buyout of Beats’ headphones business, and Google’s invasion of the smart home, either could be a smart alternative to an IPO for Sonos. Sonos has been steadily improving its core product — home stereo systems where each room can be separately controlled to wirelessly play music from online and local sources. It ditched its proprietary controller to let you use iOS and Android devices as remotes, and eliminated the need for its “Bridge” gadget you had to plug into your wireless router. Alongside Spotify, Pandora, iTunes, Deezer, Sirius XM, and your own music library, Sonos recently added support for SoundCloud and Google Music. What’s left is to become a household name. Sonos has already begun buying expensive commercials on primetime music TV shows like The X Factor. It’s also running huge outdoor ad campaigns on the sides of buildings in Europe\n",

      "For Uber, Airbnb, OpenTable, Customer Ratings also help rate the customer: Travelers are often asked to review their hotel, restaurant and car service. But increasingly, it goes both ways. Drivers for Uber and Lyft, for example, rate their passengers from one to five stars at the end of each ride. If a rider receives three stars or fewer, the driver and passenger will not be paired up again. And at OpenTable, the restaurant booking system, customers are banned if they do not show for a reservation too many times. While guest-tracking systems are generally for internal use only, guests who use the Airbnb online booking service to find lodging may find themselves publicly reviewed. This allows potential hosts to see how a guest was perceived by previous ones before agreeing to allow that person to stay in their home. The online dining reservation system OpenTable allows a restaurant to identify guests who booked through the system. Using OpenTable, each restaurant can make private notes about the guests, like indicating table location preference or if they often send their food back. Those notes are not shared with other restaurants. “Overwhelmingly restaurants use the notes feature to enhance the hospitality experience for their guests,” said a spokeswoman, Tiffany Fox. She added that it will ban a customer who fails to show up for a reservation four times in a 12-month period. These are among the ways that sophisticated rating systems can turn on the customer, identifying the best and worst among them. The rating systems are allowing businesses to formalize a longstanding practice: focusing on their best customers. The worst customers “demand too much, complain too much and cost too much,” said Christopher Muller, professor of hospitality management at Boston University. Beyond that, he said, bad clients make employees unhappy. Companies, he said, do better by spending time on their best and most profitable patrons. “It sounds draconian, but not all customers are created equal,” he said.\n",

      "Uber switches fully to Paytm wallet-based pay mode, discontinues Indian card payments: Global online car hire service major Uber Technologies Inc has stopped accepting credit and debit card payments from cards issued in India, and will now only allow payments made through Paytm wallet in the country, the company announced in a blog post. Last month, Uber had partnered with Paytm, the digital goods and services marketplace owned by Noida-based One97 Communications Ltd, to integrate its payment system. With this integration, Uber can sidestep the regulations that require every transaction made with an Indian credit card to include two-factor authentication (2FA). Earlier, it had come under fire from Indian monetary authority RBI over its automated credit card based payment system.\n",

      "US offline retailers ran TV, radio ads targeting Alibaba: Several of the largest U.S. retailers warned that Alibaba Group Holding Inc may \"decimate\" local companies unless Congress closes tax loopholes for online retailers, singling out the Chinese company before it has even established a major American consumer presence. In TV and radio ads over the weekend, the Alliance for Main Street Fairness, which includes Best Buy, Target, JC Penney and other major chains, called on Congress to end special tax treatment for Alibaba and other online giants. \"Main Street will never look the same,\" it said. The ad marks one of the biggest public marketing campaigns against a Chinese company that handles more e-commerce than Amazon and eBay combined, even though Alibaba only surfaced in the American consciousness after it went public in the world's largest-ever IPO in September. U.S. retailers and industry analysts expect Alibaba to soon launch a service targeted at American consumers, armed with its IPO war chest.\n",

      "Thanksgiving sales shocker: fewer shoppers, lower spend-per-shopper send Thanksgiving weekend sales (online + offline) down 11% Y/Y to $50.9 billion, from $57.4 billion last year, according to preliminary survey results released Sunday by the National Retail Federation. Sales fell despite many stores’ opening earlier than ever on Thanksgiving Day. And though many retailers offered the same aggressive discounts online as they did in their stores, the web failed to attract more shoppers or spending over the four-day holiday weekend than it did last year, the group said. The average person who shopped over the weekend spent $159.55 at online retailers, down 10.2 percent from last year. Over all, 133.7 million people shopped or planned to shop at stores or online over the four-day weekend, 5.2 percent fewer than last year, the federation said. And shoppers spent an average of $380.95 over the four days, 6.4 percent less than the $407.02 they spent last year. Executives at the retail federation, which had predicted strong growth in sales this holiday season, appeared at a loss to fully explain the drop-off. Black Friday itself may be waning in importance, as retailers increasingly offer deep discounts days, and even weeks, before the traditional year-end sales period. That means many people may have simply done their shopping earlier and stayed home during the Thanksgiving weekend. But even there, the picture was not clear: Mr. Shay said that people also might be holding out for even better deals as the season progressed. He said that the continuous sales had conditioned consumers to expect better deals the longer they waited. “Holiday sales are now a marathon, not a sprint.”\n",

      "Lazada raises $250M Led By Temasek; valuation at $1.25B; H1 2014 GMV $91M (+202% Y/Y): The round is lead by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, which manages a $100-billion-plus portfolio and this year invested in another Amazon rival: Snapdeal in India. Lazada operates in six countries in Southeast Asia — Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam — largely in tandem with Zalora, another well-backed e-commerce service started by Rocket Internet. This new funding round takes Lazada to more than $700 million in money from investors. Its most recent round was also $250 million back in December 2013, which included an interesting strategic investment from UK retail giant Tesco. Together, Zalora and Lazada have probably raised around $1 billion in funding, although the value of some rounds were left undisclosed.  Raw figures about its business did reach the public domain this summer, however, as part of Rocket Internet’s IPO in Germany. According to a filing reported by Tech In Asia, Lazada brought in $91.4 million in the first six months of 2014, generating 1.8 million orders from 1.4 million active users. Those modest returns perhaps explain why it has been placing more emphasis on its marketplace. Lazada says its marketplace now accounts for 70 percent of its revenue.\n",

      "An interesting linguistic analysis of online reviews: In general, the length of a review corresponded with an item’s price. The most frequent interjections were “wow,” “yeah,” “yuck,” “yikes,” “sheesh,” “yum” and “yippee.” Slang terms that showed up most often were “meh,” “whatever” and “the bomb.” And adjectives were not always what they seemed. Wherever it appeared, the word “delicious” was always unambiguously positive, but not so with “good.” On all five sites, “good” often appeared very close to the words “but” and “not,” indicating ambivalence. Reviewers often wrote statements like “It’s good, but I’m not in love with it,” or “It’s good but not fall on the floor dance a jig good.” Among the most frequent three-word phrases, or three-grams, were “in the room” and “the front desk.” From these patterns, she surmised that consumers who stayed in hotels were about equally focused on the room’s quality as they were on customer service. Frequent four-grams included “in the middle of,” “the rest of the” and “at the end of.” That fits with Dr. Vásquez’s observation that when people write about hotels, recipes or diaper bags, they like to tell stories. Narratives, she found, are more likely to appear in negative reviews than in positive ones.\n",

      "Uber is causing the price of taxi licenses to crash; separately, a legal setback causes Uber to suspend operations in Nevada; ~1000 jobs might be at risk: The average price of an individual New York City taxi medallion fell to $872,000 in October, down 17 percent from a peak reached in the spring of 2013, according to an analysis of sales data. In other big cities, medallion prices are also falling, often in conjunction with a sharp decline in sales volume. In Chicago, prices are down 17 percent. In Boston, they’re down at least 20 percent, though it’s hard to establish an exact market price because there have been only five trades since July. In Philadelphia, the taxi authority recently scrapped a planned medallion auction. Most major American cities have long used a system to limit the number of operating taxicabs, typically a medallion system: Drivers must own or rent a medallion to operate a taxi, and the city issues a fixed number of them. In New York, which established its medallion system in 1937, that number is 13,437. The number has risen only gradually since the late 1990s, even as the city’s economy has boomed.\n",

      "Amazon is circling Jabong; potential deal size ~$1-1.2B, two sources privy to the development told Techcircle.in. According to a source, the meeting took place very recently and it has not even been a week. Restructuring would be complicated: Jabong is an inventory-based e-tailer, where foreign investment is not allowed at present. Another source cited above said that Amazon would keep Jabong as a separate property post the acquisition. “It (deal) would be very much on the lines of Amazon’s acquisition of Zappos in the US,” he said. Jabong, which is one of the two top lifestyle e-tailers in the country along with Flipkart owned Myntra, reported gross merchandise value (GMV) of Rs 509.5 crore from 3.197 million orders in the January-June 2014 period. This marked a three-fold rise over the previous year. If it maintains the same growth through the rest of the year it may end with GMV of around Rs 1,300-1,500 crore for the year ending March 31, 2015. Accepted fair valuation in e-com space internationally is pegged at 3.5x sales which would value Jabong at around Rs 5,000 crore. Jabong could be looking to drive a hard bargain given the strategic play of Amazon in India and significance of the deal to win in the high stakes game in the country.\n",

      "Uber is close to a round of financing at $35-$40B valuation: T. Rowe Price Group Inc. is in discussions to be a new investor, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the details are private. Existing investor Fidelity Investments is also set to participate in the funding, they said. Uber is raising at least $1 billion, the people said. The financing hasn’t closed and the terms and investor group may still change, one of the people said. T. Rowe previously considered investing in Uber and may still end up passing this time, two of the people said. If Uber completes the funding, a valuation of $35 billion to $40 billion would more than double its $17 billion value from a June financing. At the time, the valuation was a record for a U.S. technology startup in a direct investment round. That put Uber at the front of a pack of elite U.S. technology startups that are valued in the eleven-digit range, including Airbnb Inc. and Dropbox Inc. Such valuations are spreading internationally. In China, smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. is in talks for a funding round that would value it at $40 billion to $50 billion, people familiar with the matter have said.\n",

      "Production and delivery bottlenecks are crimping Xiaomi's growth - but its India focus has only intensified - will make locally, and launch Redmi Note in offline stores as well: Instead of expanding into 10 new markets this year, Xiaomi will enter just five. That means consumers in Brazil, Russia, Thailand, Mexico and Turkey will have to wait a bit longer. The problem? Production and delivery bottlenecks are slowing the no. 3 smartphone maker's pursuit of Samsung Electronics and Apple. In the past two months, Beijing-based Xiaomi has had to charter special flights four times to make scheduled deliveries into India. While Xiaomi usually relies on commercial cargo flights for deliveries, the company can't always get the space it needs to meet demand, Manu Jain, head of operations in India, told reporters in the New Delhi suburb of Gurgaon yesterday. Hence the charters. The solution for Xiaomi is to produce its smartphones in the countries where it wants to grow.  Production in India will likely begin in one to two years, and Brazil may start sooner, he said. While Xiaomi has pushed back the expansion plans for some markets, India will be a \"focus\" for years to come, said Barra. The company has sold more than half a million of its low-cost phones in the country since expanding there in July. Xiaomi is on track to cross one million smartphone shipments in India this quarter and could break into the nation's top-five smartphone vendor rankings, he said. \"Like Chinese consumers, Indian consumers are quickly warming up to bigger screens on their devices,\" Shah said. \"Redmi Note will provide that power boost for Xiaomi to quickly move up the rankings capturing market share away from the incumbents.\".\n",

Like recent physical-virtual crossover hits from Disney and Activision, Nintendo figurines use the technology known as near-field communication to send signals to a device connected to the game console. For Disney and Activision, the toys are required to play the related games. Starter kits are about $75, and figures start at about $13. The Nintendo toys are not required to play the related games, but instead offer bonus features. Each character is $13.

Uber has been sweating in India ever since local taxi services complained to the RBI that Uber was violating Indian foreign exchange regulations by routing credit card payments from customers to Netherlands-based Uber BV. Most of it was converted back to Indian currency when payments were routed to cab drivers’ accounts in India, after adjusting for commissions, promotions, etc. But the RBI agreed with local competitors like Meru that such transactions violated rules meant to prevent fraud or flight of capital from the country, and that foreign players could not be allowed to bypass a two-stage credit card authentication process required for digital payments in India. Uber was initially given until October 31 to fall in line with these requirements, but the deadline was extended to the end of November. Now Uber has added Paytm’s digital wallet to its payment options. India is the first country where it has made such an arrangement.

That was nearly double what the sale took in the previous year, and this year Alibaba will be looking for similarly massive growth. (2) Can mobile sales break 50%? Mobile sales accounted for about 36 percent of Alibaba’s overall sales in Q2 of this year, so breaking 50 percent this Singles Day could be a stretch. (3) Will this year’s Singles Day go international? Through programs like Tmall Global, the company has increased the number and profile of international brand names on its ecommerce platforms, and today’s results should reflect how well that’s panned out. For example, Tesla automobiles go on sale on Tmall for the first time today. (4) Will delivery get better and faster?

      "LinkedIn is being sued over Reference Search: The LinkedIn service in question is called “Reference Search.” It is available only to premium account holders, who pay a monthly fee. An employer or recruiter can use it to generate a list of people in its own network who worked at the same company at the same time as a job candidate. It also allows premium members to use the site’s messaging system to contact people who appear on those lists, without notifying a job candidate. In Sweet v. LinkedIn, a class-action suit filed last month in Northern California, the plaintiffs contended that LinkedIn, in providing the job reference material, enabled potential employers to “anonymously dig into the employment history of any LinkedIn member, and make hiring and firing decisions based upon the information they gather,” without ensuring that the information was accurate. This, they said, is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act.\n",

One version of the Workday predicts which high-performing employees are likely to leave a company in the next year; it then offers possible actions (more money, new job) that might make them stay. In another instance, expense reporting software can predict which employee populations are most likely to exceed their budgets.\n",

      "As Singles Day approaches, Chinese Regulators met Alibaba, JD and others to warn them against (1) raising prices to lower (2) stocking out selectively (3) making superlative claims: China’s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) recently held a meeting with ten of China’s top ecommerce companies, including Alibaba and JD, to send a clear message: platforms must take steps before sales are publicized to ensure the deals are legit. Specifically, the SAIC is worried about the following abuses, which it has gotten consumer complaints about following previous years’ Singles Day sales: (1) Artificially raising prices so that they can then be lowered to make the normal price look like a great deal (2) Claiming to be out of stock to avoid selling low-priced items to too many customers when stocks are actually sufficient to honor customer orders (3) Changing orders or canceling sales (again, to avoid having to sell too many items at a discount) (4) Advertising using superlatives like “the lowest price on the web” or “lowest price ever”, which are illegal.\n",

      "Caught off-balance by Holiday season demand surge last year, US retailers (a) boost demand planning (b) hire more (c) push in-store pick-up: Last year hundreds of millions of gifts and bad weather overtaxed United Parcel Service and FedEx, leading to shipping delays and empty space under the tree. Given the expected spike in online sales, the big question will be whether retailers and carriers can plan well enough to avoid the same problems.  “We started talking to our customers much earlier this year, and we were planning together with them for their volume forecasting,” she said. U.P.S. and FedEx, which typically hire tens of thousands of extra workers around the holiday season, plan to hire even more this year, both companies said. And they are taking other steps, like adding more sorting facilities and technology to help track packages. At the same time, they will also be crossing their fingers to avoid the abysmal weather that delayed shipments last year (FedEx even has 15 full-time meteorologists on staff). But the onus is not just on the carriers. Major retailers like Walmart and Target are also taking steps to make sure that customers get their gifts on time. Target is planning an even bigger marketing push to get customers who order online to pick up their gifts in the store, a feature the company introduced last year, a Target spokesman, Eddie Baeb, said.\n",

      "Samsung is acknowledging lost ground to Apple in the high-end market, and will look to re-claim lost ground in China: Samsung has capitulated: It launched two phones last night, the Galaxy A3 and A5, which are both “mid-range” devices with metal bodies. They look a bit like iPhones, but they’ll probably be priced cheaper. It’s the price that is key: Samsung is basically saying it cannot compete against iPhone on high-end prices with top-flight models, so it must compete instead against cheaper low-end Android manufacturers like China’s Xiaomi by offering quality devices at reasonable prices. The Galaxy A3 and A5 are seen by analysts as Samsung's first counter-strike. Initially launching in China in November, they will be Samsung's first devices to feature fully metallic bodies and its thinnest smartphones to date. In size, the A3 and A5 are comparable to those of the top-of-the-line Galaxy S5, though of lesser screen resolution quality. Meanwhile, Sony will retreat from the Chinese smartphone market, where it has had little success.\n",

      "Now, a selfie-makeover app with a clear monetization model: Photox (pronounced like Botox) allows users to submit candid photos to a team of editors who will give it a touch up — or overhaul — depending on what changes the subject wants to see made. The edits can range from minor tweaks, such as teeth whitening or eye color correction, to near-surgical changes, including breast and butt enhancements, full-body weight loss and bald spot coverup. Once a user uploads his or her photo to the app, they are presented with more than 30 editing options. Each edit requires a certain number of credits, and each credit costs 99 cents. Removing a tattoo or scar requires one credit, or 99 cents. Erasing the photo’s background runs nine credits, or $8.91. “We have a lot of people using a photo from their family vacation as a LinkedIn headshot and you would never know it was taken at a restaurant or on the beach,” Imperiale said. If you haven’t been hitting the gym lately, Photox can add six-pack abs ($3.96), give you skinny legs ($3.96) or bulk-up your arms ($2.97). If it’s a dermatologist you desire, the app can also minimize wrinkles ($2.97), lighten skin ($3.96) and remove acne (99 cents).\n",

      "LinkedIn could be an excellent B2B marketing tool, and in fact may already be setting up for a clash with SalesForce: Here’s a hypothetical scenario: What if you included some JavaScript from LinkedIn on your company’s website so that whenever a signed-in LinkedIn user visited your site, you could see who they were in LinkedIn Sales Navigator? Since the overwhelming majority of potential leads just browse and don’t fill in your forms, this would give you insight into a whole new population of potential customers that your Marketo and Salesforce systems can’t track. If LinkedIn offered a more sales or marketing automation-style interface, you could select, group or filter those web visitors and send them educational LinkedIn InMails or purchase targeted advertising on LinkedIn or in their LinkedIn email digests. Marketers and salespeople could eventually use LinkedIn to reach new prospects who haven’t yet visited their sites. LinkedIn would know which types of users find your company interesting – especially if the company worked itself down the funnel towards Salesforce’s territory to offer CRM functions. By knowing the history of your leads (i.e. which ones end up converting to customers), LinkedIn could help you pinpoint your hottest prospects even before they hit one of your landing pages or contact forms.\n",

But by this July, it had begun to stagnate, and now according to the latest numbers, investment in Yuebao is actually dropping.

Of the total amount, Tencent pitched in US$145 million for a 10 percent stake in the company. On the surface, Koudai is a typical Chinese marketplace with a nice looking mobile website and app with an emphasis on fashion products, but it also has a few tricks up its sleeve. The biggest is that users can browse and make purchases from shops within WeChat. Small vendors can use the site to set up their own shops and market them through Koudai’s WeChat channels. That’s a huge opportunity for merchants looking to capitalize on WeChat’s 438 million monthly active users. Rumors on Chinese media suggested the three-year-old startup received even more traffic than Taobao on mobile, and Alibaba founder Jack Ma himself approached Koudai’s would-be investors to discourage them. Koudai could be a powerful ally for Tencent, which makes WeChat, in its face off against Alibaba’s Taobao and Tmall marketplaces.\n",

Although many people only associate Apple Pay with the ability to pay at point-of-sale at a growing number of supported retailers, Apple Pay also enables in-app transactions to take place with just a touch of the finger. That means that more consumers will be able to purchase things in apps, and this will be easier than before because they’ll no longer have to remember their Apple ID and password. Instead, just by touching on the fingerprint reader on new iPhones and iPads running iOS 8, they’ll be able to pay using the credit or debit card information on file, already associated with their Apple account.

It’s way beyond anything I anticipated,” said Joe Megibow, chief digital officer at American Eagle Outfitters.  American Eagle Outfitters placed a beacon at the front entrance and in the fitting room of each trial store. When a customer with the Shopkick app entered the store, the beacon sensed their smartphone’s presence via Bluetooth, and triggered Shopkick to display a message offering 25 extra kicks. The beacon in the fitting room determined if the same customer had approached it, and awarded the 25 extra kicks. More than 10,000 customers took part in the trial.\n",
